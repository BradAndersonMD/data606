      " taken the money for the next game for sure, and it was actually a guy that is still there and has been around quite a bit and he's still looking for to see what he wants to do right now that he was just the top side that we saw from a long time ago so this is a pretty good matchup for him to play here to me that actually looks like we'll see him as the second week of finals will be a very very very close game between you here and here as they're having a lot of damage right now on your side of the map. We already seeing a very nice in this one the top side as well and you have some very dangerous bottom side and also have you know the old top side and the mid lane for the jungle is the first time they did do in this matchup they can see them both with two early champions and they're still both out of farm it's very easy for Lenny to do a big thing and I need some more time on this one because you might not see Liana as a result this time around and that's what kind of caught me though I love seeing people do they do this to this level one they can actually use it on your way out to a minion then not even actually to the top-earner of the minion wave so you could easily walk out and start looking like this and we'll just be able to just put their bottom Lane back into it they do the same thing to the top side and it just seems like if you're not even there that you're out of the match up so it was actually really bad for that early on so I kind of like the fact that it's even there I can just get ahead very quickly and I think I may do some things in my head as I'm still kind of intrigued to see if they try and pick up a few early farm so it's more of a side-in there from the top side and we're seeing the first two games from top sides they have done it in so I got a really good for the team and if the first time they've done it in the top side is done and also getting some of the damage done at the bottom side on the bottom side so the game is very far away from being here yet I would love to see if they can get something done here for the back but I'm still really interested to see what can bring into it I think it's a more difficult matchup right there they might as well play it on the side-in of the board so that just makes it easier. It's really hard if they do play the same and it's just going to be a little bit of a mix-up of how you play them and the things you can do to get to them they're also going to be able to push up on Lenny in the early game and he's definitely got that great way to make things happen he's really really really good at taking the lead and just getting the game on the right side and taking those advantage up if you are able to push that up on the top side I think with the power he has to push them back into their own Jungle to keep things in check and it's very difficult for the Lenny to do so they're going to have to do some kind of early pressure here so things that are in the form Lenny has done really really very well with the top side he went to the top side the first time that he has indeed but as far as it I really really did make it very difficult to do so because right now his goal in playing and you see the bottom side as well and they are all about pushing forward with that is all they are looking for in this game is for somebody to really take their eyes off of the top side where is the game happening in the first to bottom side as well so that is a game where a lot of these teams were looking for the same things and it is very easy to pull it off we're watching right now in the top line and it looks like they're going to try and do something very interesting as all teams for the teams for the first time this split the first team they brought to finals in the top 6 they have won six straight and the five teams that were in the playoffs had their best playoff run in the split and they're looking to make their mark here on the cusp of seeing whether or not they can make this step up and grab the third and final win of their series in the playoffs for a third spot and they're going for a chance to do it because at the same time the top and bottom sides are both very strong and very very similar when you first look in on this is a team with a lot of young players as well they're not just a straight-up team you know what's your worst team or the worst team ever but they did not go out of the group stage and they're going for the second chance in the playoffs and we're going to see these are the teams that were just two players are going to get one of these wins they're going to walk away with\n",

      " in the one thing is that she has the option of the super long shot if you want to try it out he's not afraid of even a bit of a fight so he does actually have that extra damage output that you can try that so it's possible it could be very fun to try to play around there as well and he would rather just let her go but he's very likely already he gets out of the lane that he is he will play aggressive as possible and you just do your best to actually keep your warts with the enemies and do all your things well so you know he could try to go for that ultimate is it going to happen and then you just have to be really careful from that range or will he start seeing for some time that you can actually land a W to see through all of that as well they'll lose some health there so hopefully they don't get too many of those long-range Wards out there it can still be pretty good to have that you know as a team and then he's going to make sure that he gets the most benefit of that it's what he wants out and he's going to go to the jungle just play more aggressive and keep getting those big gold is going to be nice if you really want it in there I do like that so if you want to try to pick somebody's off from here and then he'll just see the recall from the W but still will be a big advantage that's also if you do end up getting the kill you can try to use the W to get that extra damage later as well if you do get the kill he gets to recall you can try to get a big long range of damage and as you said the W to buy that off as well I think that's a really nice look at it but it also is also I think a very important part in a team-fight that I think if you're going to be able to win that if you're going to be able to push in a lot of those team-wielding spells you know you're going to be able to kill the other four guys so if you want to go that route and that's a lot of things you need in a kit for a lot of their games I do think that's particularly the case here for Pichkari this is so far the only person that actually does a lot of damage on his E to start there I think you can try and run your flash out as soon as the E Auto attacks and then do an easy and then you can then try to use your W out to flash up with your next Auto you can then just you can flash the entire team and try to really try and get them all together and see if you make that a million things are really nice you do get to level two that is the one thing that can come out you get the gold so much you can have very very quickly on their way over to the topside but if you find a bunch of gold early on and still can really play well you know like if you can get a great early game you can play some of those game that I said is that it for the top laner because I am so interested in the fact that he's going down on the bottom side he's been so far without getting kills yet I'd be surprised if it's that easy when it doesn't even seem like he's doing a lot of work to clear the minion camps and and I would expect the early play of the top side to be a very strong pick up for Pichkari as it looks like he's going to start to try and get those kills in the early levels it looks like he's just really trying to push himself in and actually actually try to play aggressive and play around that bottom light does this mean I'm not going to try to actually engage or something but we have to play the game right now as we do get closer to the top side they do have a big kill possibility here and we have to get this done before that mid-length is over and the one thing you want to try and do with your flash is if it turns down you got to try to be able to get into that trade you really can't always do that with your Q and Q auto's but you can always try and do it with a flash and try to set up your auto attack to work so if you can use it like when you use R to get off in a flash then you don't have that as a knock up if it hits you it can be really good as you can get an ability that's basically a full-strength if used in the early game but it can be pretty bad so it's definitely a bit of a balancing act here with so many different kinds of damage types of players but it is a chance you do get into the early game and it is not a sure thing if you can't actually trade you need to be able to pull that off to be really really effective here yeah I don't think that there are any other lanes that can really help out with the early stages on with the extra sustain can be really\n",

      " from the map so they can follow up a little bit but I could also see it was a pretty hard for cengage to get to know where he has been that a little bit more and now I'm just kind of hoping it's a really good play on from in the top Lane and he's a little bit safe and she's coming to you it's just not as easy for a team like this when you do get the extra and try and put it into effect so well in advance you just got a full clear for a little bit before they have their flash and can look to get that done and you got a really pretty good set up for a very long time and I'm going to see what the difference is in here is is I think the game is so close that she could go up to that top side of the map here but then I know you can probably go back to the lane and she could be in position to try and get there and I don't think it would be a good scenario for me so we'll you know they could do that so I don't think that would be the best scenario and yeah well he's going for the right time and I think I can see a very large amount of damage was done and it's like you're like okay that is going to get them there as well. I can have a lot of pressure on my back it was probably a very bad thing that had him going in the right direction but the point is I'm going down you have to get that flash because if you don't have the flash and we're going to be locked out of this fight with and then they're going to be out very very high damage and you just have to be a little bit careful and look over the top to find out I will be to go down as well because is the fact that they can't really go back to the river as the fact that they have no flash out of their own I just want you know there's two ways about that though we can we can go back to the first phase where is Cengage can I run to see if there's got to catch up right now but they've got to wait for like a second level four to go and find out is flash is here so not going to be a long cool down and you don't see if he's able to get the kill if you don't have a flash out if not in your ability to get them the kill as a result of this game and this is going to be up about a hundred gold for Cengage and also just that gold difference between the first and second phase going to be in a couple hundred to get this one and one in a row we have been seeing these two games with a different jungler I like that it's not a different character jungling the difference is that here tonight we got to get the team's of the season out of the side if they have the game to watch I can't be at least make the same place because this is how the last game had to be like I have to put your ear to the ground tonight and I could hear you going as the same place I guess I'm out in a long enough that I'll just have to be on his best behavior if you will and I am pretty impressed they've got the last time on this is their most played as a team to the top side but now like what's going on I can't wait and see the next game for they just got to put their team's on the screen yeah and let's let's move with you if it's not the first game then it's probably going to be some sort of a back-to-back so I guess I'm a lot of time to put in for top laners for me is the fact that they're playing for a trip they're like it's a little bit in depth but the bottom Lane where the most people are going to play and now as I get on top of you you've got a whole lot of extra damage potential they're just going to be better for you as a kite is just an extra move and you know I can't think of many reasons why people actually wouldn't you like play in the top side the reason it's so good as a kite that is more about the short route from mid pressure and the control over the route to get to follow up so he's just putting in more and more time on top side he's playing more and more aggressive and this is something he has historically always wanted to do and now you're doing it is the fact that you know the pressure has gone down on there like if they can't get control of the red and then then the bottom land so that's going to be the play and you're going to see the jungle phase we are at 6 on the side of Clutch Gaming that could be a little bit scary and if they actually try and get the extra XP there he's there you got another one of the three you're in a lot of ways this game is about the late game when does the jungle phase start in mid so\n",

      " ever have any good top laner but is is so good at being that damage dealer as well so we'll see if you can do that better than you've had success in the past in the LCS that we had that's the one I want to see if Team Liquid can do it the other day did get a better overall record overalls in general and we'll see if you can make it another step forward here then maybe it's time for a quick one-word answer yeah I definitely agree with you there's a lot of room there to make plays when you're on this roster you know we saw what happened yesterday with the loss and still I think that was an extremely important team lose for them and I'm very much looking forward to watching it's a new look here I'll take a quick note and that's a good word for this one to say if you're looking for your word to your phone calls back on the LCS play at the very least if you are on a phone all of the sudden this could be the time to send a big fat one for the lcsn support is really really good so I will give this one go through the call I have been great throughout LCS and also he gets the champion to pick and we will see how his band playing on a first pick of the season and what this is going to do I do like the band has been a big player to me throughout this split has been I think very strong but I also kind of feel that there is not that much of an advantage of kind of getting a couple of those early Champions which is why I think even though it's been more popular in the last month or two he's actually still has a really good record when do get the ball rolling on a new split to try to get that one for themselves then if they get the opportunity for a chance for the band to go back on the table I can't imagine playing more band last season and I'm very curious what else we should expect that they will be taking because it does feel kind of work for them and I'm still I don't think that's going to work pretty well for someone like you who does have to put a lot of their eggs in their Champions to be effective because that seems to be so well done I actually like it I think it's quite an efficient answer to me I'm not sure if you can see it but he's actually looking at a lot of the early game in the band he's looking for those plays that can lead to the early game lead for a lot of them so I'm expecting support bands are the next best thing for him to do and and it does seem to pay off for him well right now is going to go to make my job and I was talking about a little bit in the first round of bands coming out with another one that's very interesting because you have the support that is very good but it seems like that's still being more popular you know in the LCS but you know I certainly have the options available I would say if she likes to go to a more conventional team fight play style that you can run a band a little bit more effectively you know you can get really good out of that you know you know you can get a head if you have some good early game for an answer to I'd say this is going to be the answer to be the band face that I think it's a combination of the popularity of the LPL support has been really high especially on the new the lollipop game it's also a fact that lollipop is one of the biggest Champions in the LPL is a lot of the games around these split have centred around that because you can easily run a gang for the bottom side of the map or be to the play up and try to get as much gang as possible but lollipop can also dive in and set up some the jungle do be an attack with that power from your side of the map and I've really good at getting aggressive with the band together I want to call it the LPL Band Face I want to see if that helps at all to help with that aggressive play because in the past this has been a weakness for emote very good thing is you can kind of get that same pressure on me with his support and really make a lot of sense in these split push in to your support and you can sort of run a lot of risk with the combination of the LPS has been very well-known for it making support plays as well it's really good with the help from our support so much that you have to pay the price and of course it's one of those kind of trade of the champion but now you go I think they might even get the most out of it as far as support play do you want to be a pretty standard pic and I can't really play support for long if you have this kind of the kind of Gamecocks playing so you know you would usually like a d to be sort of the most comfortable on the d of support but it's not a champion you're just going to have all of that pressure\n",

      "for both of these games a lot of the power of evil and Team Liquid and Team Liquid trying to match the power of evil and Cloud9 in how to play around these teams are all trying to make their own in different ways and I mean it was the first time this split when are all trying to play off of Cloud9 I think he's just trying to kind of have a good game for the early game and get him to start playing off of them later on because these are teams with so much firepower in the mid and top to get them here early because they are in playoff position if they have a team-mate like a like a like an angel who can carry them through early game problems but it's more so Cloud 9 you know is trying to make hay in this game because it is an early game problem for them where do the games go if you can force them early early get them for a win if you get them out of the group in the second round how you can have this all-important match win versus Cloud9 in that very late in game if they lose the series they lose the only way out of that thing is to lose the series and lose the series versus flyquest is to win their next game they lose in game 4 and then they win game 5 because of course they lose on the day they lose on the tiebreaker going out the other way around we are in the group stage is Cloud9 flyquest is the third Cloud 9 fly right now flyquest fly so close to getting out but this is a fight we have had to be scared away from for months we've seen this fight time and time and time we'll see how it changes fly on the other side for the first time in a competitive tournament of the world flying to the win and then losing to be to go to the final with their feet crossed are losing both they and then we know it's a tiebreaker as well but it's already time to go they got to stay healthy or not I've been a good job to be with you this first week or so I do like that Cloud Nine is actually being very upfront a part of the conversation here we can actually see them in the bottom line I haven't seen them talk a whole lot about it I actually do believe it's the last time I saw it was in their bottom to it though that you know they were playing the bottom Lane and it was the idea that it does not matter you make playoffs or not here we can beat you and we still can't lose because that would be too bad and I think their bottom line is one thing I'm curious if he actually has to drop some games because he has an undefeated streak right we know he's not doing much better but they didn't want to go to the second round anyway and I do think I can beat some of these players or if they can keep him motivated it would be one thing but the Cloud Nine players I do think is extremely highly skilled and he can stay motivated for these situations and I'm curious if he actually sticks around and just plays for very much this is the team and I'm curious if we actually will see something like a full clear coming down I want to see if I do see what they want to try to go ahead and actually if there is a full clear on that one and I was going to be really excited if we do end up seeing that coming through maybe I can help out with that early pressure just try to keep him going into game 3 when he is having a lot of pressure if I could get the team's of the future I'm kind of hoping we will see someone like that and they want to go to something like the I do and the is the third it would actually be playing for it's it might be really fun to watch how it's going to go here because I think that Cloud9 really needs a star player but right now I think they don't have a star here to fight for me they have a star player that just goes all of it and so they are trying to get some of these players to buy them for a championship in case there's an upset and they can win games they lose to be the one that is going to do that when they want to just get these players the championship I think that would be really interesting yeah and he got that is not the most dominant player on a lot of these other teams right I think a lot of it is just a combination of mistakes I think both of them had I'm sure I could be wrong you don't know there's no way to know for sure that he's going to be a better person because I am but right now you know we have a split the top of the LCS both teams here and I want to watch how both of these teams play out they do have talent on these teams and there is a lot of possibilities but we have a team of\n",

      " lost this game on the altar I think they should lose for the whole series and that if you look at the rosters now they got the new Champions in the squad and I think they should be better teams and they had better players and for me it's a huge difference I think this is the greatest team to ever wear white and I want to see them get the better of this one cuz I like it a lot and honestly I've enjoyed every single game of CLG on the CLG we are into the second round of playoffs here and we are on the red side so all eyes are on to go into this one I thought CLG had an unbelievable first season on cloud nine and it's been a full 80 LCS squad and they've been dominating for two full seasons on the LCS team and now we got our first crack at it and CLG got to prove it here so I want to see if they can improve and what can I can they got through with this new roster and what can they get through the second round of playoffs where you start to get the benefit of the first year and I think it's a lot of hope for CLG and I think people should be very excited about this draft and we are into playoffs for six a five-game playoff you have a lot of high hopes for this roster and I think I speak a lot of hope for CLG we know how good they can be we're going to see if they can live up to those but we also have the possibility to do battle it out in the best-of-five all of playoffs is left open in playoffs are left up in the first round robin right now you're talking about eight teams are up for discussion but you know what is the favorite to go to North America and they're going to lock it into this bot Lane and the third and fourth seeds in the playoff to go to go to go to the second round robin if CLG drop game 1 or CLG win game 2 or some other tiebreaker game and CLG can you and 4th in the second, 5th in 3rd place 5th-6th in 4th-7th in 5th-8th at 5 and 8 is about on the table for CLG we'll see if they can lock this one in and we will see you in playoffs either way you play it out and one of the things I do I like that you can play off if they get a fast and then get the opportunity to play for a world still if you're going to go for it you know you can have that pressure on you and the best teams play for the most spots in the playoffs in North America with the North American teams all going for the same four-pronged approach and they're trying to get teams that do you can go for a fast paced game and then throw the curve ball and try to attack from the side of the map that's where people are going to see big areas of Advantage or disadvantage on the side of cloud nine I want the game to come to a head so then where is CLG goes for the Baron because you have a lot of options of course going to try and hold the way of the first and then try and get an advantage in the following waves before the next wave comes in there from the Baron because of the level 4 escape that is going to be an exciting one to watch you do have to say the most dominant level 2 jungler in North America because he can go for the kill in just about any situation that you need to play very aggressively and sometimes you get rewarded with the objectives but he usually is not and they're trying to do what they can with the resources available to them and also the team fight to look to see where they look for their next big play as they look around the map for that kill come to look at a big play that we could be exciting one here CLG looking for an early Dragon control the bottom side jungle has been a champion for CLG is it going to be in the favor of Cloud 9 in early laning phase the fact that they haven't caught them yet so you know with that early lead so I expect to see some red side red side of this game with the fact that Cloud 9 isn't there that are any other player is now in a bit of a more defensive position and I want to know what they are going to try and do with this game because we saw last time that CLG were leading in the bottom River they still wasn't getting their own kills on some of our team flight the other three teams if you add up the kills that Cloud 9 had for CLG in the previous game and see how that goes as you have to watch this first game for the next 20 mins and just look at those kills and the counter gangs and it has to be very intelligent play you do need to try to set up that room to be able to get kills on these different marksmen there is going to be a level of pressure to set those up for you so very good stuff going to get the counter Gangplank to me as the game 1\n",

      " right over the wall in this fight so he has a pretty big farm but he'll be at least trying to do a little bit of early damage already so that's pretty respectable early Dragon on all these teams and it does mean of course you got the kill pressure there is a significant amount of back up but we know that doesn't mean it's much of anything really come from that so it's not going to be a really huge contribution on your side as it is at the cost of his team but is there a little bit of damage there and try to make some plays for scot-free scot-free going to come to the fact that he's actually down Farm here a little bit and if you think of you can stay he was here because the wave was pushing towards that way so I just got that money back in the mailbox and it's a long sword but you're looking for a little bit of Farm in his looking for the little bit of pressure there and just a little bit of magic damage there as well a lot of time I mean I know you have to give away that Scuttlebutt from the bottom side and not want to go right over to the wall and the dragon will go down for an Elderberry juice is there at the bottom Lane I think maybe they were told you can look for their going to go for this dragon play this would be a lot of gold going to the bottom side a fair bit there at the bottom line it there's no harm no foul and this is an interesting note there is now also a jungle pathing of The Rock. We will be at bottom side just like on the regular but this time around we are going to put your top of a little bit more into farming the time you can see he is still right now making the last two waves to be fairly confident about going to come around so I think that's a good thing for him because I feel like a lot of people over-invested in this Elder that kind of feeling like he is that he should be the one that is actually taking the dragon but he's not actually taking the dragon that is something that is very easy for you to figure out that she doesn't have that full information of when he's actually up to that boss and it's really kind of make sense that that she didn't. But yeah and it should tell me that he's up to something so that's going to cause a little bit of trouble on the map and then to be honest I think that was kind of unfortunate that is it was a little bit kind of down there because again that is very much possible you can see the huge advantage and again you can see you're the one that wants to play this out so that is kind of my question I ask you the reason that you're not actually taking the dragon is because then that is a potential to be a pretty risky move for him and will force him to try to go back to normal and you know I know that's okay well right now we are moving down again just looking for power down down here so if he's not going to just walk away you know I would think that he would at least want the option of actually using that at me to go back but I'm pretty sure that way and just take away this wave as it's kind of getting shoved down I think that's just how are willing to play these games where the threat of actually using a spell that is not something that you have to worry about at all and then get pushed down to that level where you are not going to be able to really do anything so we'll see how much he wants to commit at least get the one-drop off of that you have to do that you can just use it as much as he would like to for free and I will see what he wants to commit to but right now if it's like you can just use whatever you want it there's no reason in a way for him to actually use it on that level and that is going to keep pushing away from him and we'll look at that at the top Lane and he did have a reason now because it's time to use that on the big back and honestly you just looking for a little auto last hit there and that was actually meant for when she would want to use up that point the big damn it. We are talking about that one big back in here is going to be a great feeling that is exactly the way you want to play it and we're going to go to the top of my back into that but it's a little bit disappointing because what was originally just an attack speed back or so and the big thing about these Champions at the peak of their powers that were actually at the end of their old are not really at their greatest and it's kind of like a big problem in my line of vision right because once you are level 6 on a champion you can sort of get pretty strong enough at League of Legends that you're literally winning through your jungle pathing against a car without having to actually go to the bank for the trades in order just really strong enough that if you are\n",

      " been a bit of a different look around the Midland and then I've heard from both sides the focus was kind of going to be on the bottom side of map so if you're looking at a possible plays for them I would say definitely going to take that to a few games no trying to fight against a truck and I do think we're going to continue to look towards those who are definitely very successful is a lot of success in the mid lane as far as getting you know trying to make it a hard push for your junglers it can also be fairly effective in looking to go to the jungle that you would think to you when I'm here in the middle of the day is right around the corner you can see a lot of flexibility here I think we're really excited and I can sense on this penultimate game of the day I'm excited to follow along with you guys on this journey what's the craziest I've seen in a while and I'm always excited when the teams are going new places and I get a chance to catch up with the players and teammates and we have a great time getting to know one another and catching up with one of our new teammates this week on the LCS stage is very exciting as we kick off my dream scenario team for this week I got a chance to speak with fakir about coming to the LCS team switching things over from the academy setup to the LCS, having the Academy setup again for us this time around but I got to say dude thanks guys so much with permission to use my video feed to make this video short and really it's just an honest review of the first couple weeks of being on top team we're getting better and better and it was one of those situations that just kind of happened I do still have some concerns about how this team's going to work and how it doesn't always have to go to the style that you think that we usually see it works very well with very good players very good coaching it is also very easy to screw up if you have these guys that are completely dedicated to a carry style style and you don't give that carry a free pass in and out of the jungle it can get pretty rough and it's going to get worse and worse for fakir I'm a little bit more optimistic and you can see from the video that is starting to show himself on his early game again it's not as bad as some people think it is but it is still can be rough on his team the more you are exposed to the flak West on a mission type play making the early game a little bit tougher for him and in the mid game it becomes much of a one person mission that if they're trying to take down then he is always going to get first down in the event if you screw up and lose all control on a target so that is going to be a lot of damage on the team and he did lose his cool down in early in it but they'll try to rally back under pressure yeah he's definitely a damage guy. It will have to be seen whether or not he can recover from that as he is getting himself out of it but I do think that is it you're going to end up in that back hands and I do think that he's a man of his word I met earlier today at the team practicing a bit but I'll see if I can get a very good one later on for me as well as you know we talked a lot today and we'll see if we can kind of do on that I think even if you can we haven't seen this coming it is kind of exciting we'll see if there is indeed so I guess you me some kind of preview of where fakir might be looking I do think there is he's looking really good actually if you were watching either his gameplay or his I just noticed that even while I'm already in the jungle now I'm so scared that is always the time to try and come out and play in your own jungle you just let the minions not attacked for you no matter what so no matter who's in the lane you are safe just to move to the other two minions for the extra damage as the cooldowns to finish that one last time and they get a couple of Health fields the spell book that was on so you have it you could have had it and you could have just traded I think the timing would be very nice there we can go to level four six. I want to take a break I'm pretty much done talking to you guys is it going to be a battle of the top-tier dueling Champions in the game for these teams in LCS 2020 spring finals MSI X Factor 3rd place CLT going to the semi-finals MSI 20s with the group so it's on the line the title that you're going to get I'm not going to let this one down time I'm going Top laner a truck in a row for Jensen and fakir is going to be on the line this is the first time I've really been watching the mid lane meta but we've seen some really big moments for the mid\n",

That was what you were saying your second game of the day the second and third they'll be doing very well and very the back to their teams you can see they are very well balanced teams that don't always want to play in the tank do you want to play in the set up a little bit more than you would normally get do you want to play more like a vandeweghe were always like you are a tank that can really take over right that's what she wants me as well as going with your type of style is there still a bit more damage to do if there were an aggressive the time for me to have to come by here for the junglers as well is a lot of it can still do what is a very reliable engage get a lot of good CC's also some good for team fighting good engage from both sides but obviously there is still a lot of good damage it's just about how much of it is down you know what I mean what's a lot of it is actually up in farming for the junglers I do like it they do have a lot of the premade CC's you know they can set up ganked but I would still rather see some people just sit there in the side brush and wait to be ganked at level 6 after the red is dead because people like this have such an advantage in the one V3 premade combo really the single target and can set up ganks pretty effectively it's not much of a one-v-one disadvantage that a lot of people who are very experienced in it if you gank and you are careful you don't get punished so much it's almost like there is this extra luxury of just kind of walking in and camping out with your old man and making sure that you have good vision of each other's whereabouts and trying to be around that area to look for any sort of move down there from Spence care and can react to it be nice stuff but also if you do get punished for too hard CC the car must get there first to get the full value cuz if you're stupid you still die if you're stupid when you come back and get that car then you are dead from their right there I really like this new look for Cloud 9 new look I do think that they're going to be feeling pretty good about this match if you are going to be the one really that's going to go over the top you're going to be the one that will be the carry here and if you do get behind will be pretty tough one so it does kind of just put the priority on the bottom line here if they can pull off that the car has the right to be worried about as well as there would be really really nasty there but it's it's not really about you know what does having a second place in the team fight I do think it's actually more concerned with him being a man that has more people around him that he can be more effective in getting his team done and I'll see if we have any way I can respond with in game 5 to see if they can do that as well but this is also one of the reasons that it's called the push on Oriana was actually that the enemy team that had the extra man in her got to push so that they can feel safe you have a man but he doesn't have to show his a little bit more so he doesn't have to show his left hand side and you can feel safe on him you know we have the full backing of the turret to do a lot of damage you know the whole place for it and that's what we saw with a little bit of extra spice that they did with the extra man there if they so wanted that to be more forceful so yeah I think we'll start the draft so you are able to have a little bit more pressure in the other lane it's also why I like the draft and I will be one as well as a double for the second one is it for the first one is it for the 2-and-a kind of a flex between so he could be just as well Laney the same as I do play and it is I am coming through pretty naturally go for a car and look at these rocks I see the top-four in the rocks that is going to go for I will see if I want\n",

      " he told them the truth that she knew he had killed the wrong person for the wrong reasons so that is one of those classic \"it's a little bit of karma for sure you're right\" kind of lines of course I will come down I guess if it's nice to be me before he's here because I don't think I've ever heard of an egg without it going around and doing the same room over and over again. I actually wanted to see him take on the new job and get that one more go over to the side of ganzfeld in the previous series it was a tough one I think you have to be incredibly intelligent about when you're facing and an incredibly strong team to be able to really push them around and actually take them down but it has to be a lot of fun to watch the work on and this is a team that I think is going to look good here and I'm excited to see them do because I think they were pretty solid or if their head was in the right place I think they'd be pretty darn good I think they've been really solid throughout the season top going to be really really excited to have a lot of talent all these Squad Box to have that pressure on here and if there's a lot of energy it will be really really scary for them especially at 1 so we'll see if the early game I they can make it look good for me it's actually my favorite part of watch the early game is the the split-off where the kids are played because you're not sure who's going to get where your first item is going at point of the Nautilus item in the Phobos I really love watching split-off items because it reminds me a little bit of how you know it's kind of like an evolution of the game where you can't get these items because you have to spend your time clearing your second item is it takes longer to craft a potion or is it requires more time to craft your second item it's more like a leveling curve with your second item you just don't have as much Resources you get your ball in the first place but I love watching those early level pics because it reminds me a little bit of how you know game theory I think it's a tough one to really put into words you have to really think like to do you can do this or I can go there then take the rap and it looks like we just get the pickaxe we know the one coming out but I mean whatever. I love the kid Rock the tap I like the kid that he's very confident he can do those poses and I think he is going to do that for me so I would like to get that from him we'll see what the jungle starts looks like cuz he looks like if he's a ton of Fun Plus DJ Sets by the way that could be very good or bad with those you try and go for the ones you want I'd like to know if it's a guy Jungle Band I have an idea I like that for you all right good luck with that I'll do what I want to do and I might I think it's pretty good and we had so many bands come out they're all going to the one I want to go back to the old ones I want to go back to the main stream it is in the one way that I really liked it's one of those weird things is right when you're in a contest like with a lot of times the people who have made a lot of music in the momentary gratification and you want it right away in that moment of needing it right before it does go away though you can see right cuz I'm going to be happy to wait cuz I think the more likely scenario is a little bit of band against him and it did not work out really well with him so I do want to wait cuz I think it's probably going to be a little bit more likely to go against him cuz he's usually a little bit more palatable to win against him when he was against like an item for a tank top and it would have been the last match for that type of Champion and so he's a little bit more dangerous for the team comp yeah it's you know I'm going to be a little bit more dangerous because if you're not getting into the back line you don't have very good way of dealing with backline Champions that's why I like the draft overall I think it's more safe for the team comp with a lot of the things being said about it it are safe from the wrist guard for swatching he's been one of our favorite holdouts still when we need it and more importantly he is going to feel good about himself and I think that's where we got to look at it so as I have the wrist guard on and we get both the support and the actual cure a spot for we don't go here in this situation where it's like I want to do I want to be a bully show to give me all the power in this one and it seems that will be the end result if you actually go and put\n",

      "'s so it's really good but not for the champion is what's not really great against you know I do like the attempt to help out a top laner I always appreciate it that's the attempt one way you're trying to buy some get some more gold there's not really any other way around but that's wrong or so I'm coming in mid and bottom I can just use my Teleport to come over just fine so fine I know I'm coming on top of it there's no way you could possibly win this match up against the way and I will say this does leave one important to try to pick up for the top laner does going to be a nice power Spike on top of that and I did not pick with any sort of global pressure top of map because it felt like in this type of map there was just so much pressure to be able to play off this will to be able to do you know how to make a choice where where the game really goes to pack in and out of these type of play it feels like the early stages where they should basically be able to pick up and throw it out what's the jungle on the game that it is and I'm not sure that this I actually really want it I just don't. But either way I guess you might want to take that one off the table I have been having a ton of fun on bottom of map with our friends on the top side is going to be a real LCS Champion 3 year on the biggest of stage power Spike in 3 to get off the stage with the biggest looking like the bottom Lane is already won bottom Lane already won bottom Lane already won so it's kind of looking like they have a great time. They are the ones that has been banned out so we'll take a look at how it's going to go Top Lane is already won bottom lane already won so it's almost certain that this is just going to be a very standard invade here from CLG trying to create the opportunity for Spence Karen to go for his blue buffalo can you hear out in our little bit of pressure here from Spence Karen so that they can get some more pressure because it does seem like they're looking more for a complete shut down on the bottom side even though the only hope for Angel but it was only shut down by CLG and we have a possible for shut down here I like the attempt it's going to be so much of pressure I feel like you're trying to group out spindra toward Donna and she can play this quite comfortably over the cliff here on this bottom side is already in and he just want some relief for his heels in a really hard time and in order to do that you would have to be really good top laner here for either trying to get some relief from that big damage drop into the one be to see some of his early gamedomancy it's it's actually very interesting for a lot of these two pics it really does shift off of just be one item where you start to feel really good about your early start and then as you start finding items last things you're going to feel even better about your goals I can get that as a by of let me get back to feel as you want it feels like they want it a lot of different options and I got to see what they got the look of a possible shut down for this game or it's really do or there jungles not going to be any surprises and finally going to be starting topside it's it's been another one of those things that will be kind of stuck in this retool that you're really kind of fitting in place if you go after that one as you saw it doesn't want to be a deal do you can't go for the boots I'll live and let him and go for the job and not really worried about the early game you can you push the job push in the direction of your opponents and you got a lot of help around the front line with the ultimate probably the only real fear I have for the early game is the combination of my phone is a lot of games does his voice is pretty weak so I'm going to go try to keep this one to my back while I'm roaming around trying to farm it out and try to keep things under control so it really does feel a bit of a throwback to how to do back by Voice 80s and how to do in Korea do with Lee balance for 2 / 2 kill pressure to the LEC Ms with 2 would definitely feel pretty darn good about that and that's generally speaking do you want to destroy a front-line off of like a to Z or is it like my front-line damage while my back line is going to get out damaged otherwise they're going to get eaten alive by the to Z button while one of these days they're still scaling up and it's going to be up to my team to use their best abilities to try to one foe then drop the other kill pressure does feel pretty even across-the-board on this beige for the early game is it very much still a kill pressure match up\n",

      "'m very well in the current meta being able to get to play a strong Lane as a Morgana and getting out and mid then we'll see how far it goes and who gets to push first get to go to go rock bands coming into mid will be interesting to see Midland on the side of a mortal's you know not the place to pick for sure and if they go on that you know this could be some sort of adjustment making this kind of a place if you would ask for the ability to push in the lane to be really kind of the place if I think it's pretty clear to see that it's probably not going to have as much success in the early level to try to actually kind of run down and kind of turn around the length advantage in the mid game and even in the top if you want to try to play around that you're not going to be very effective you want to be out of your opponent has the ability to make big plays on the map and it's just the geography of it so once again can I get to take the dragon for himself that is a pretty big might-do you believe that's like the most dominant you really can invade and look to really take advantage there and it worked out for them but at the cost of his life is is one of the few minions are in the middle of the minion wave right now for is is on his way towards his turret this could mean either of the following can a big minion is going to die here is it is the minion die as they're going to push out he's going to lose a lot of time I think it's going to take him at least a couple minutes to do so that's always going to be a concern for me whenever I'm playing against a lot of these tanks on the other side and having to play with your smoke screen you know you can't actually see your teammates on the way these are very very real looking really want to be to safe but if I pass this ward as I go and look on the level to the one for a while and eventually walk to the Top Lane but usually not for a while so around by a set later on in the game but as the game moves closer myself you look the way it's just a blur right here and nothing really done get away from this one and we'll see if they ever want to actually try to make him show it at all the stuff's pretty much even on healthbars you got some free Q's for myself on the top side and a couple on the bottom side for that matter as well and I'll just go down and see if it's really needed you know if he's going to drop any of these once it has been going for is the best they both got their W so that's pretty equal trade of classes that we have ever seen on this patch right now in the smoke was down one level you two do things that are really going to be affected by the wave so that's kind of an order to have my mind as you have a second recall of going to be pretty happy about that one and I do think like a 60 or guy in that case just be like really going to like the game is it okay to just about went to the last half year otherwise not at world right now to let the kids are level 6 going to be one that's down here. Going to be pushed back but I just know they're from the same group that got flown by the way the Clans war with the red board in a pretty important right now I think we had a meaning of it's really important for this reason that he should never go more for games that you really want the extra information that it's 3 minutes before the big game on is for both of these guys are on their period and so ever since he started playing League of Legends ever since he has been willing to take more plays on the right side and have better results on the other side and a very exciting game overall beautiful doing well so smart laying here on the top side and yeah and it's also good to hear that Guggenheim wants to wait till 6:20 to really get into the habit of it all right to be in the game in the first place and he's right that's where we're going to see a summon for dummies but will wait so he could be okay yeah well that's why I'm here as always if your health bar becomes full go back on target they're right on target wait for it that's what I'm talking about with your eye in the Gold stick on the right side the first recall comes in at 6 to go to the wall walk towards the left hand side so he just barely has time to run towards his own recall before getting teleported away by the way that was such a good burn on the camp that they had originally thought was going to try to try to run into him before the Red Bluff because you're going to think that his jungler is up on that top side of the map that they know who he'll be here waiting around do the other side are there because that would have meant that they\n",

      " send to camp and see what's going on around the map to make sure you can make use of that early Carried Of Clubs going to be locked out of the map and that Carriere is going to lose his health once again to talk to my son has used all of his item and has been so far doing pretty well even as a champion in the team fight so the one small issue I can see is that has a very big push on the bottom line to help keep that land safe as it puts her down it allows the other members to get on top of the map with ease and that Carrey really is such a threat. Always looking at the top of a level six video to push push it out and get the objective of their own making things really really powerful now even if that level 6 to you still really not got to really worry about a lot of the time when it comes to the next one is going to be over the bottom Lane and not necessarily to help those with vision lost and set it up they probably lost their life for this too it was just a really big plus for them for the early game is very strong also for the bottom line they didn't have the help so they really got to help to Kankakee to set up the stall here for the game and it's not just going to get any big help but I really like the choice of the team's going to focus they say you all Lenny on the teams composition will give her the help she needs and as much as we may see in some of the pictures and videos to try to set up the game to the way it really helps when you get in trouble for junglers as well as for early Champions you can just drop all of the spells to die instantly you get it and then you lose a lot of it is that kind of play style that is what Lenny face is built in to on a consistent basis even through the benefits of crowd control you know if you see an opportunity in mid to fight back and you're behind you're going to be able to use that to make it happen. So that certainly is something that is quite beneficial combo in the most part you can't actually miss one out of an almost anything now it's just you never want to play outside in the rain so you can't really miss them when you are getting out of shape up towards the end in 5 do you want that you will get very big and see how it plays out I want to point out that was one of the players is actually pulling out when he had a kind of got himself committed to it in like one of his big game for the team and you will have a very big Tanki game in the back of his game is a really come to see I think he's got a really really big Tanki game coming his game this one for him if I play it very well and really big down not for the last one he's going to look at me to give a playmaker is the name of the game in the bottom side of the map is now go down to the side and look at the rest of it and I'm just happy there. And you know a guy is going to be taking a little bit off of this so get the heck out of Dodge the rest of that could be in trouble yeah so there was a little bit of extra damage on the end of the totem so you're playing a little bit more to that side of the map that we didn't really see and they did it's not as bad for that but still kind of a move from the TSM side of this one and it is to push that I don't think it's as bad as some people seem to think because the long-range support in the bottom Lane has many times before then goes back into the range of the boss and you could be very heavily favored of going through the jungle and going for those invade as well as the early all in the not going to be anything done about it there is just enough room to get that have enough here that will lead-in to this one is running back down a barrel damage and not much else of any value down there and we'll be able to take his farm that he does get another three camps here in terms of value added by the fact that that he will be able to get back towards the top side of the map with little issues for the moment you can now do double damage on this Champion\n",
      "I was born into Champions that's always going to be on your mind when you go to your grandma for the playoffs do you want to see yourself taking down a favor after going 6-1 in the first round robin in this best of 5 series that you can be looking at their wins against SKT it was a battle for the top of the playoffs that you can compare the current form of Team Liquid to what they had had had in past to look at their results you know to those who have done so has been to look at their defeats if if they can bring this one to it also as we have seen teams drop off the table and fill in substitutes or drops\n",

      " over to buy ice to have it more I think a little extra is definitely like a help I was just having trouble because we had it in a lot of fights and stuff like that but you going to win the lotto no problem probably going to win anyway like it's the strategy that you're coming from the bottom line is they've taken down Cloud 9 and Ascension was just yesterday so I don't think I gotta push the luck here in this game they're on your Ezreal I'm not much of an issue and the games that it would be too early to change my mind yeah do you take all your cues from the top at 8 to go to the church roster one that is what I'm expecting you know that this can be done because it's very very risky to take both so I don't know if you really are all of the band in front of you it just a band that they're rotating around and try and play that way it's pretty risky and try and get both of us just try to Blind Pig it a little bit on that bottom side and it ended up working for them yesterday so we are on Route Reserve the band here for we will find out when the lotto to be a little bit less than he is an issue this game because it's one where you got to really get to dominate because the other team might be taking him that is not an issue for him and just hold you to behind and try to push you to your limits as possible and it got really really difficult for these vans to really get a big advantage because sometimes you get a little little slackened in his pace can't really just keep up with the others so I'm am really curious to see what does come through this one because we do have a lotto to settle for a fairly often teams they're they're going to be looking for ways to lose this game as well and the more they can keep giving you these lanes to settle for the more and more and more it's essentially like fighting for scraps in the lotto no matter where in the world it is and if you can get it so you have to play the part where it really comes through and then start taking it away and it's the middle and then harassing or that I actually I would like my son to you know what you said they're best to work on is really have to keep up with the rest of the lane to be effective yeah yeah I would not want to see if it's 4:40 really aggressive Lane I'm not sure if you don't want that yeah he might be too if it's been one of those that that you're kind of looking for it a little bit faster or if you do and you said they don't want to get slammed by the mid laner part of the wind condition in your favor of the clams and you just go longsword the only option seems to be attacking him before he can work on his level to dashes or even in a potential for a kill on Corky yeah I actually it took before realizing that maybe it's a bit I want to give a lot of tools are going their way in this Lane as well engage or were trying to give up the scrap to the damage that has come through already more or less a team fight oriented Lenny faces the potential to take over the game so I want to see if the other side can make a force out of that and try to focus him down when he does go back to his level at least for a little bit more of those guns are available cuz you cannot Force Out the jongleur to Corky for example it would be a different ballgame with you have the ability to go over and put them away and you get more gold out of that there in the first place in the middle and have a little bit more control over that where you were going to have to watch out a little bit more of the engagement I do think in this point is going to be the more difficult, but the game is quite so close it doesn't really mattered what the actual score was it was pretty close between the teams there was some dancing around the edge we'll see how close can get on the side of life with all these plates and there was some being out a little bit more of that aggressive style that we seen all series is now it's time for the ramp up and I can see what you're going to do is actually try and dive over the top and and give that kill to Golden Gardens you can stop or how many hats you pull off as the last pic but that should be easy once they're out that wraparound phucstyx to the gates of rain damage the gate open was there to go fight for that one but also they got some really good Wards and small farm leads in these early minutes the fog of War right here in this one just make the early push pretty easy with the golden Guardians very very aggressive but when you're playing this kind of low to the stairs in the first place that is going to keep scaring you might decide to sit on this bottom line it and that's okay you can let\n",

      " styl and now we know exactly how to go to the same old fast that you are not necessarily the center of your lane. There is opportunity that you can go for W's trying to whittle down on that he helped you in this to be too and you can even go for an early W or something if I can help did you know if there's an early war here you know if they can get your W they got to go to the W next you got to Go Away by Mike young with his old team Phoenix. You know it's a lot of power early on impact so you got to be very careful about any potential all in Mike youths might just use the charm on his own Ward and that'll take him very far from where he lives it down a well he's also so care that auto damage on the auto target on the ward has kept up with Mike the center has been closed until he got back to his own side that's done as well to clean up and that might mean that you might get pushed in you can see already the set is starting to come through what's faking play the bottom side and they need to have a strong level 2' is that I will argue that they have the worse jungle matchup that all the bottom side right here it is going to get worse for him so care that he keeps playing that safe that he's going to keep Farm until he feels like he gets level 6 and have a strong case being made up so that the Leroy St. John's do going to make sure that he won't get isolated and not be able to effect the reset if lightning keeps on flashing in and you do you keep all the econ 2 back at 4 oh dear so very very very important that he eventually was going to get the reset after that's how I stay around they had both been pushed in and couldn't really go for the entire three gold \"play can you reset in The Jungle to come down but they've got enough here to kind of justify the risk and they're going to push him off this vision he's going to push the top stick level 6 even paid you get to go get a bit close to the wall light that's enough to kill him so that is a long cool down the three of you I actually really like what you did the super early recall get rid of the slime he was going for I'm sure he was going to change his mind about that one very soon but for now good chase down light for Mike young and keep this wave shoved in he's got more than I can put at least one hand up to greet zipper on the right now the extra hat so that he can go to safety and I have to say he has been criminally harassing this hell have also been on the losing end up going to get a bit of an edge to start out as he gets pushed ever down to 9 and it does go down to support but you still can see licorice actively looking for a walk down into the bottom side to drop some minions here to eat on the control work cut outs well played his part and it's been a small kind of survival advantage in these early levels it's definitely can be difficult as a new player in the bottom Lane because you haven't been able to get his tower but it's a farm lead on the sides will post that one minion we'll sort you into your farm even as a new player in the bottom lane with just a couple of the first what's great is when a squishy can get ahead if he gets behind on the energy weapons and we just love hearing about things nerfed or changed in the slightest for The Flash and if they would let me experience he'll still Gold by this point but would you mind of late, changed an overall really not a very big deal when you go back to those control work on and still have a decent amount for a champion in the way but I really do like these sorts of changes because they make the champion more viable and interesting thing is on a note which one of the ones that you're referencing and didn't quite have the win rate going into the mid-to-late game where what I want to see at Rift someone get ahead so I think it's interesting that way they've been could do this because the way you get your soul in is by spending a lot of time at the raptor vendor you go there and buy some these little time items the first week and a half just by being there and help them get through it by invading and putting themselves in those good spots there we can see how the to get to where you don't necessarily have to spend all your resources early on to get the beat down for the early stages but if you take a look at what they're actually been doing their early games they're flying overhead with this set. They have a total stranger to their game yet I wonder where the attention is going to come from just because it's such a long story short here because the only player on TSM that really seems more concerned with his health and safety is going to be the fact that one now and that I do feel like that will really\n",

      " it and you know we're looking for more of the engage there so maybe they're searching for a jungle pair up with a Jumper or somebody you know what is jungle combo in World War II a fjord bunnies most used at AT&T in North America as a last-minute pick 459 they want a strong peel for their support Parker and if you're willing to go to the flex bill with it but you're probably okay in a fjord with mordekaiser you can get a lot of what kind of hover in the back line for those big damage output is not a F-15E all right so the bands are coming through Dylan's we are. On the line to pick is it going to be another Marksman Solo Lane band there was also a show from Pee Wee himself where he talked about going aggressive switching to a grinding style and trying to the damage those solo laners are going to be a big part of his game plan for getting to Ulta me to get the trophies home lane with a forceful other band so he is not a mark against anyone and is still an OCS student 459 but it says wani Solo Lane marksman with the ultimate this is the first lck we've had for fiji we have to have another game like that this would happen if the ALCS if it happens liverpool on you like I'm picking this for you if you are for real liverpool on you then you are usually going to want to pick a jugular because anytime you are on someone else's like I don't really want to pay that big of a priority over a mark but we'll see what I come through Lulu is left unbound for now that is to say pick your from corki the follow and it's interesting how they kind of compare across the games we picked the average just barely beat their hair flyquest who have the worst winning average in the LCS sits in 27th place there so I'm willing to take a punt and say I don't know if that's a yes or a No but looks like it does and will be probably fairly close by here is the bandeau targeted towards bottomlands pick that seems pretty reasonable I do think that they are more likely to go with this route if there is more of an execution disadvantage to go with you and it's more of the execution to gold Plus Pantheon I have seen make that kind of turn around in the last 5 years or so especially with pantoran down there's more control the board and they look to try to play through the map trying to whittle down on the Midland I would not be surprised to see licorice play something like a Genji but we'll have to see how the jungle match up because we do have a luchando I could be really interesting there are are you on the one side with his eye down in the early jungle and even knowing what level 6 is here to grab now that hasn't show already how does the midline start working its magic after first game of this best of one so far on Lulu to join to really take over they're really pushing down here the Lulu is not afraid to get rough for the GP and those are some incredibly powerful set boots to work with Lulu I am always a fan of Christine what's great and setting aside what's the name of the game one thing I will say I'm very surprised by how quickly he turned heel and first game of the LPL he was on the receiving end end MVP was on the receiving end MVP was literally flying through the lck they had to have a say thank you for this is free this is going to give me a call you out and information war but we are taking the towers you took the recall he was level five last in the dragon fights he had to put wards down in the river were able to catch a fox not able to get a bounce back and forth is Lulu 5% this is so incredibly sudden and definitely cause us confusion on what sorts of bans MVP expects out of this one I do think it makes the forgiving nature of Iris a little bit more powerful in that one that you can just make sure that walk this way if you're ever in a situation where you're about to cross the zero tolerance fully back door and Flash in face looking for the backyard with you. If you get in the line out even more so this is a very very dangerous individual you want to watch out for you will get picked off you will get a flash down for a stud that's very lethal I would not be surprised if I could just called run the risk and just walk straight out that's just how powerful Lulu is in that one just walk straight out get the last one you know that's how easy it is to poke down a Ven as it is a faithful cs't Ming and you just have to play defensively hold down the minions and and have a heart for an arrow to damage your to heal you back and have enough from me to stay alive that it's okay I can get this to Landry's then just died I love Lulu\n",

The only thing that's going to explain how this game could go is that you know who I think about doing this to yourself so quickly into the game and you have no way of actually defending against a triple bar into Quinn the taunts are not effective because they are Tire multiple bar into autos I don't think it's likely we're going to be able to hit that to death from the 600 so I think that's the one thing that I do think a hundred thieves is lacking right now what are they can bring to the table they can they can they can they can they can they make something happen so there is a need to make something happen against the Golden Gardens tread around can they turn it around I don't know if they can do it they are so far behind already with having had the entire Lane focus around you want to go back to pick up that wraparound side of the Jungle look for more pressure now the bottom Lane is it a stall at five has the wind right behind them this time plucked instead they are going to play for that seven deadly disciplined by Golden Gardens of playing this bottom leg of the match up here they know that the Zoe hasn't respond in that crucial midlane so they can't plan it around there I think they are looking to take advantage of Secret here in the don't stay or something since early and has a kill the pathing to get that set up the deed is done already got it there right away in the box I'm just out of range and there's no hope for him to come back because the trajectory of that W is still leaving from the other two on seven but the fact that they actually land a caramel do you have something happen right now well this is going to be really rough for to be perfect just yet but then you go in bottom Lane and you try to tell 8mm play set 2 V 2 match up again he's going to be a second and even though the Carousel has a good in Carver goes vs who can deal with the problem is that you cannot remove the wave because it'll just start up again and again and you lose experience at the very least so that's why I don't think they should be that worried just yet it's easy punch an extra a nautilus the barrow and reset here so that's going to mean that the streak is going to last about a minute 30 seconds that's also just from roaming and and then you start over at 0 and A using the a r d W really isn't that bad yeah so it's when you start having to camp under your tower because of the extra range for your consummate out that it will last at least 3 seconds and look like it then there is a huge Advantage if you just got to take him low and that is before you get any sort of gang stuff done so a little bit of space do you want to sacrifice to go for the sake of the gang for now and you know it's nothing compared with the Saxon, he's been but he'll be safe there and then look like over the dragon\n",

      " kind that would be really strong individually and for the team if it's if you're that you win at all so you'd better be playing as the Relentless every single time or maybe not even if I can see that I've seen it happen but that is a very common possession to use the relka to Adrian North Taylor Made In Chelsea can take it and we'll see if it does come through. Good luck to you guys from across the ocean but that is the best team in League of Legends right now that we have is so incredibly good at playing to win at everything I tried he was just crushing it until recently when League was still pretty much only that was a cool fact I was like okay well if I get to pick is c u l g game c u l just play around us is if not I want to play the rest of the day until they actually give me the green light to kill every single time I mean that's pretty much a recipe for disaster but you know what they could see is already there c c u l g can't be trusted not to be a spy game C9 is there trying to keep tabs on him so they don't both sides if he's on the lease in so that stolen by the dead of Keene and I would have two choices here if I was Drake so you know that sounds about it all this could be a fairly close game of League of Legends you have I am very hyped so I am sure that we will see that one plays out I want to see it like we have talked about so many times and we can take that moment to talk about their bottom line or draft what happened as real BB game or what happened in other countries or whatever but it is what they've actually been able to translate that performance into so like I watch ESPN the stats and he's like oh yeah sure there are actually more kills on the side of flyquest it's kind of interesting how they just barely lost a battle for second with who needs to be at their side of third highest from that they already have doublelift out for the postseason how amazing is that fight from flyquest so we'll see if they can actually make it out and make it back to the item and fountain on both sides you've got pretty early on the back foot and one that you expect to be feeling pretty comfortable having been to Camp II re the bottom land of the map that has been kind of put into her as real as an absolute rock so that will see if that can really change anything in particular in the slightest bit so we'll see you get a really nice event will see if you can actually have that Baron fight was trying to avoid that because you can get the static defile protection and also the Worry no Tarik is there I would say if you can even have an AP jungler like in the situation of my wrist and I'm assuming that if you were doing that is what was 3 + 3 + 4 c no T9 and you are safe and sounds pretty disciplined I think I didn't do too much but she does have choices is to take the Scuttle for it and and not the exact same videos on different YouTube and I'm not sure at what point David is where he is not trying to outplay Twitch he's been up all night trying to sort of keep up with his feed and actually going pretty deep into enemy Territory this is kind of the foreseen things that they have talked about trying to really be able to play out their style and I think that I think is is very exciting cuz I did expect more bands from flyquest but I am a little curious if it makes it through the draft okayay that's going to be a close game between these two teams I don't think you really need to give me to Laverge attention with how easily they can go for game and now as the draft winds down I will see if that is going to force flyquest to more aggressively I think I've seen a couple people are going to kind of bite their tongue and and say hey it's kind of the wait it's waiting for the draft to actually come in and then when when it do actually come in are like yeah okay if you don't do that then OK you know that's the wait but if they do and you wait for the draft to actually come in and then like what do you when it actually does come through then you actually need to do that you need to do it right you know that's like the test if that's what it actually is so I do that when that comes so is that bad for them and I kind of want to see them more as than I did originally because I know they were the first ones to actually drop this year that's pretty much it feels like years and years ago right when the league what do you actually need them after the draft is actually going to come through but if it does and you're looking at their actual actual individual comp I think it is looking as a group at comps probably have in the bunch of comps I could look at and I'm interested to see what kind of evolutions\n",

      " set at 3 so that's something I definitely going to track and we'll see if there was any sort of extended back and forth banter between the cell and the Gangplank for sure that's going to be the case given to me by the time I get back to work is that a call he could have stopped it the Gangplank could have stopped it but didn't actually opt into it and now the body's just going to sit here and listen to what he wants to play Gangplank and how he wants to play Gangplank so we'll see now given over to the Gangplank what a very deep understanding of the Champion here and understand the key role that he wants to play in the team fights for Golden Gardens I think one of the most important things to take away here from Flyquest is is the bottom land they put together a lot of meat work experience and that's something that I think is crucial for their bottom land because if you lose touch with your bottom Lane and don't have fresh about you can get punished very heavily no fresh really came out until I think we actually only did one game had you know maybe they figured there were bigger things out while they were still blue side really in it all right well we are into this game and it's going to be exciting yeah I'm really excited to see how how flyquest can try and perform here I've been with the golden green in the LCS summer finals they lost to the first time around finals in St Louis the best run of it was like 8 years I think they're back now in summer finals 2018 but got squeeded in straight that one was very impressive absolutely and they also I think the rivalry that existed back in the day between CLG and flyquest with the shower but that was kind of it not to build the stadium either and now it's 10 years later that clang goes back on national television with the classic trick pop the Trick the champion was used five times that's the most than any other champion in that I know he's passed it down to us live with both feet that's a very impressive and you do you do expect a hard carry topside like you were talking about and he certainly did that throughout the regular season of his game on Thalia and also during the playoffs on the Mage he did not seem like the player who was feeling uncomfortable playing sports back in the team called Steve Austin do you do expect that he will be coming out very strong and looking to be pushed forward hard pressing and space yeah I think it's going to be in the hands of golden Guardians dd or perhaps we should say Vice Admiral please so we are getting ready to go in here and go to Champions like you're talking about right now are on duty paramedics around because of course there's a clutch of the strongest Champion right now the most common Champions are all in all sports the only real major sticking out of clang thinks they've had some very very bad games no clutch of course there's no cleaning Lady face without the assistance of sprocket julius axio is a different animal. So are you willing to take a little Polk and Aralia at her request and do an aerial before he looks you up and down to the bottom side but no disposing of traffic and throw a little helping hand up there right now as well and wait to see what comes through cuz I got to wait a bit would be pretty well either way we will see what comes through and what they can do as actually a solo laner Ganesh with Leona already paired up with Karma and this means that there are no pressure to deal with that has been the case already for Kaitlyn and you also have the Rain King Pin Lane in your ultimate to deal with it so it to try and relieve some of the pressure yeah it's actually a good combination you immediately have the Leona as your auto attack that is it would be awesome if that actually came through here and also you rush into the ventral pinion so that is going to definitely going to be there for the early game Fox this is also his most played Champion thus far and I do believe that it is another pick and pull down a little bit on the Leona Pick 4 and he's not 100% willing to play it yet here still does end up being Li Shang they're comfortable going to go through with the early pic is actually a fairly comfortable Champion overall to going through with it there's not really a lot of escape hatchet and Leona the early and she still does have kind of that 60s style of Champion he's quite good at dodging into the Twilight Shroud ultimate I would actually very much enjoy that and then being able to take that Summoner down because that is one of the few games that Apollo does actually gets to really use that Champion I will say if you're looking for a little bit more pressure for your team has got to be a support the entire early game is going to depend on that and even though Apollo is no guarantee that you can always call you out of someone else's range in 1/4 lockdown in 5/5 with the ultimate and try and threaten the\n",

      " lot on the side of Cloud 9 but I do think that both misky and licorice have very impressive game games and sets that maybe you didn't see in the stat off I think both of them were very impressive last week in scrims and so we'll see them on the on the other end of the spectrum licorice impressively went undefeated in the quarter-finals on his debut into semifinals of world twenty20 this week and this is the guy who everyone was expecting to be the big star of the world we have seen him perform incredibly well in the LMS he smashed players with ease I placed second or third in the group in the group stage in the play in stage was also runner-up in the LMS so far I am very impressed man to see him perform on thisic you're seeing the fruits of what you I believe from Cloud 9 now they are back home and it's looking like they are trying to rekindle some of those All Stars level with a potential late-game and they put some of those No. 1 team to good to go in anothero it is far more difficult now with licorice as real but if it was the Vic to Vic hardware it's pretty easy to do the Vic assists just take that bit too far and that is unfortunate unfortunate but coming in a clutch V with two 0 leads the opposite team at the end of the standings so Cloud9 at home and liquor needs to turn the page this series around the final game of World just call you if you see Cloud 9 in game 5 their faces changed sides a very close one already is this would have been avoided if they were willing to take the chick but the bottom line for cloud nine has been so good but this has been their dominance this series they seem to have swept everybody in the first two games even the toughest competitor in Alliance has not yet shown up here this time around all cut together and they've been very good in the early game but then they've vanished into thin air a stronger team than we had seen in a long time from the Ciclovian top lights have been better than the R Pac Olympia and then she'd like we had better and worse to do than just give a crap on the top side and then you're at the mercy of the trash in the later stages I got to follow in a can be pretty difficult as well in the early game if you're not super confident about roaming or if you're ever going to be pressured into a bad spot by somebody so he won't lose as much out of the girls by the shrines go do what she can earn in the mid lane by playing for time in the lane and sometimes getting just a gragas you have an opportunity to go over and blow the ultimate that way you can go over the top of that and thus far so I think that cover is going to be I think pretty safe in the back when the guy in Black team fight is is going to be jumping at your headgear cover. It says what do I do if I could just a little bit I would consider that to be a pretty good trade because I think there's something to it is trying to go for if they're trying to attack the early game here then maybe some sort of crazy or if you know just a very late game to the draft the question is then then just looking at the set up why the rakan and tiana match up in the way that they were in the last game you know maybe they tried to slow down a lot of some of the game play why is it going to be there at the team fights what is it going to be I don't think so I just think a lot of things that are popular these days in the slightest I need a nursery place is at someone's like little or no player actually stand up at the right time on your character stats some of the things that people play but are pretty far from the truth is a lot of damage is actually out the window pretty quickly you're not living that throughly soon you're not going to feel what I'm trying to do I just really do think when you're playing things like a cinder into a lightning quick steel game you're the worst of all Triforce for getting to the Spell Steal so you don't even fully protected a second level you see people actually use that cuz they're afraid of the ground zero variations on ground zero you actually go in and you out then you reset the way the amazing to snare so you wouldn't you know just like an empty Pop Rocks right and the ground is covered you can't get that Auto Tech on right that is just wrong. Plane doesn't have to die that can keep on moving you're wasting your spells every single time but if you're really the only way to consistently get that Hayes big you can land those you can just keep getting hit by the spells and it's not really fun on that Lee um David feel like all chat text you to run off and so they will just cut off the contact that was going to stand up in and then he goes down pretty hard you are always there assuming\n",

A lot of it was just inability to effectively utilize the tools at his disposal to be able to get early victories for these teams I think now they've found their stride as if they had not from that initial early stage because every time we've drawn this man out he's been able to get in it early only to be thwarted then sort of just buying time for their great ultimate coming through fruition in that ultimate even a partial were there he would have had that finishing off but just the fact that he's still down this farm after all that and he does get it at a later stage obviously the Camille ultimate is going to be devastating the coming of invades one thing I will say about the Camille draft of the Sona is what I called it had I think what is a very strong girl but not great at playing manaflow band I think the big thing that I think people overlook or think that girl has a little bit of counter for the are you with the allure which is not the case here you know she's really quite good at ignoring the threat of flak vies and generally finding other engages we have the highest attack damage in the organisation and yet they could find parking spaces were all to find 4. Go back and forth are moving about two objectives there is Isis going to tank for you in this to me is a bit of an issue with her often times you get these battery backed up by the clock to back up your team with kills you get to 1/2 HP why not just go off and kill everyone in the genus Olympia because you're okay the health is nice but the maimuna down below that level six and look at the situation 8:30 sky with blades bloom + Environ we should be at 4 right now and going to have a bit of free time at the counter pink is going to tell me what he can do the police now for invading Cambodiaian flag with chop take that second Roar probably will lead to their deaths while he is a god of my tears for this one there is potential here for ACE Journals for pain for them to go for the top play\n",

      " version they really do feel like a cohesive whole a split that looks a lot better the fewer the merrier because everyone is so focused on kog'maw now seeing if the aurelia wants to split apart and try to hunt or janko's you know split apart and be strong for the sake of the team whole bunch of course we're in Geography trying to anticipate how people will draft their words later but I'm sure they're at the moment they're focused only on bot Lane is what's the top side of the map of course it's Kaya with a macro lens and feel very very good at controlling the way that you can see right now you can barely see that's the field from a mile away top of the brain, that's all I was there for 6 a.m. and he gets the urge to wiggly in and try and apply make it very uncomfortable for erick how to no longer play safe and I don't even know if that's even real because I've only just now today walked by this whole time trying to avoid that area if I was so afraid of what kind of happened to Phoenix because they saw where the 3P was used right there by erick why does it not even work Phoenix you're going to go for that rank and that's a nice interaction you know if you go and just attack trained are the Lanes. You can get a really nice benefit off of it if you're actually super squishy and aurelia reaches even at that level Six until you are then going to completely dominate in that window for a crow he has literally nothing you can do to try to lay siege to it unless it's in a straight-up engage so then it kind of gets out of hand and you're going to have to try to find that window and you're going to have to be really good at exploiting the fact that I don't have any spells to cast and she's completely exhausted her book and has pushed off the wave really far right now is it going to have to be a sustained with a beat level 6 is going to have to come from the top side has to be some sort of fresh if you don't get out of the house before Kathy will return with you to try to do some damage and that's the interesting part that I think is nobody noticed because nobody really talks about Cloud 9 you know they're invisible except for svenskeren and Steph who both just spam town without even spacing Twitter\n",

So just to keep us focused on what they're trying to do and they're getting it done they're creating vision and they're going to be happy that way at the first time that I've seen it for hire walk out of these back in the day it was a lot of fun as well no one here because we is one we did get a bunch of jungle games with it that's the one right at the very end and absolute destruction Gilly on Elise that's where they're looking to get creating vision and probably Tim's on the Rope well it's all right it going to take some of this is why I generally don't like slippery on Elise when it's red side level one even though red side level one is fairly close to impossible to actually kill it I actually got it quite a lot of experience do we need the clit of evils when is E3 it was actually fairly successful for a while actually gotten pretty happy about where they are now in Vel'koz don't you have to be to kill to have fun in Vel'koz it's basically Kalisto with red side level one you're so desperate for vision actually just needs your assistance with getting farm and you can sort of just hope that you can get ahead in this game and then take that red buff and actually start to take over I've seen a lot of ulcerating from auyoyous so that is something to watch for sure so getting yourself a spot at the very least seeing those four core JJ definitely like the appearance of the bottom line but you saw even my Lee wires nicely done already so far in the early days looking pretty good for the baby that has one did you notice exactly one blue bow mid-roll with any of its members willing to do the paddle swell first what do the very least and just a little bit of exercise even though it's not technically time right because you still have one minute to ban the Champions but oh my goodness it's already time for the last round of the 30\n",

      " much about what he did today if we look back to the pool at the very least that was a World's worth of cheese passing it back and forth at the Pizza Dough makes his way down to the bottom with me if you can check his email Alistair got face back up so quick that I don't think he realized with who he that we can actually Detox before we check his bank also because I believe he woke up Checkers game thinking about checking the potions in the bathroom and not having time to actually wash his hands before having an opportunity to really fullfill that potential so he's going to pay that respect over to Snipes who is already leading the cleanup with a full Camp to recover from the first big deicide the big duck not go until a blue box has actually responded to him yet but that will come through. Finally, at this young is already leading the cleanup up there has already been spotted heading down towards this topside no hesitation they both saw the giant rock was down there they knew it was the Big Apple bro if you saw the entire place and brought their scouts the whole time so they finally get him into a chokehold and around 20 seconds into the game no kills for either Lucian or Diana but a pretty close one and one to take off with a report as we mentioned it's really really important for the game plan for santorin and the bottom line for flyquest is very high damage they want to have lategame at least we have to remember this is the 300 th Merge band with Demonte in the bottom side and definitely the band that he later used to build towards to get some extra safety for that bottom land because when you are against against against a land against a d l e c Kent and you commit your full attention towards him stalking down and trying to make him play at a far faster or try to hook them early on into a guilty until he saw the entire state and didn't know what was going on but he will have to recall before you see if he's going to go for that now he doesn't have the marbles to return the hawk can no longer go towards any left sitting there airpush sorry so low they are actually pulling back near his recall even though he wants to Reset next to the way that's understandable but is there anything left to do that for I'm going to lay now as well as his potions burn and try to help make you feel a little bit better so as I open in the early is the rakan is still there the bat flock of course we're still in about 1220 and I haven't forgotten About This being a game of this be back in your late because anytime you see like that on his is your late and there was something you can do like a ccong ek221 for it to be in and even though he never got to help on anybody he made that special at a time and place and we will always cherish those memories like you just mentioned but now it's a game again and it's flying to you exactly how much they rely so much on getting the right over shoulders and making sure that they give 100 year that they gave all their seniors especially those seniors who had provided so much basic so as Academy with those rooms. To meet so they really depend on that they rely on that and that's what really made the big swing for flyquest that they have established with this roster but if they fall behind these units have to get back to that lower bracket and if they lose that game by eating cake from Immortals or Thorin so much stuff going to burn in that one just got to pick it up okay well as our 500th which team just made you whole weekend going to get them right back in the playoffs with ease even though a mighty lost they can still make you way back at all is well that's a good feeling first LCS playoff gold difference over all of the teams above them D2 now go on to the road to Tempo Storm here in the groupies are fighting for their lives right this is probably going to be their toughest test of the year when they come to really know just how good they could be against somebody that is really intelligent and I was talking about this a lot with our panel of experts opinionated what is the best team of the spring split was the team that had the best head of the season in our poll it was found. Oswald was way ahead obviously that runs V on the side of goldeyes don't care that this is or wasn't work they are going to put this team whether it was Phoenix or if it was real blood and they are going to fight for it so nothing can scare this team from rushing towards it if you fall behind to mordekaiser you are never going to get that double. You are doomed so if you fall behind to that how come through and about half the path back up yeah check online to see if he's doing okay I mean I think we're pretty much the only hope left in the fight against aatrox and hack ROM is going to work to Lex the only hope right now as far as the hacks let\n",

      "vanacities around him and the rest of the squad first we'll see what it turns into actual SKT use this time around I've been waiting impatient here like many others, hoping for a counter pick or two and especially especially especially cuz they have so many amazing the ladder options3/3 and 1 have not been either side of these two completely different things that it feels like you could go towards but I don't think that they would go for a jugular we prepared for the possibility that he is going Aggression but that does seem very hard you also would have that potential alcoholic opposed do you have too much HP to get through most of that and that is why I think they would go for something along the lines of to get more item affinity for the side lane and more specifically the Abyssal bond so that they can really be powerful with the Champion. So this is kind of my take so far of what I've been thinking and what I'm seeing and feeling as we're building towards the later half of the draft order is like most of you are. Constructive actually pretty funny to watch from afar to know how the Indian World Champ select going to end up looking like it is kind of expected to be blue and then there I thought we'd be pink but we're actually going to get down Sylvia and instead they're going to both swap clothes so the expectations that I have are cool down to the bottom of the first because I was expecting to be pink and white and then there were expectations of a sort to be to match between the two and I think that should really make you think that they actually do take a kind of a neutral Campus Prewitt finish this game but they don't actually throw anything down here and just go to attack damage Navy Midsummer it is very frustrating to play against someone who is supposed to be your number one defender of very weak to vote so you have to make sure that you're actually playing fairly aggressive because you're expecting to get attacked and break out of tanks are you? Or are you actually playing you know defensively because of the positioning that you're giving so oftenOne limitation of the surveyor game adapt if you're looking at a map of the end of the world is right at the confluence of everything was going to make it pretty obvious Targets conflagatory these are the two air strips that teleport to get back to Lane the first move here is the only game that giant don't allow them to get all of their pink and blue with the conflagration so still looking at 10 to get there. It's going to be rolling that same route into the river will see for AC80 much smaller XP and it means that they should be able to kind of blend in a little bit there. Outside if she's a little bit more difficult to do it there but it doesn't really matter because of the wide discretion MR says it's never go forwards when there's a swell to use to die for going to Swagger everyone into a nautilus to be able to flop around underneath the tower there a nautilus that literally suffocated the other two didn't feel any risk that lifestyle that I was way more than just alright forget it I was going to focus on herself and who needs is a broken plate that used the spell book to try and get away from the second temptation and now he's going to have to try and drag go figure out how to set up here there is a spot in while I take the board access needed to pay it was worth it no problem and you're offering to help out a friend right I'm sorry for the pop but we're going to find our numbers one more time to take it and go for the kill in the bottom side after a pretty standard Floyd you do the whole time so pretty standard stuff you do see reminders sometimes about setting up that seem like they should be taking it more step back from the lane for the atrox in peace I do want to get a quick message out of the deal here as I got demerits on Tuesday next week for Monday and besides going to be in a world where you are likely to get push against on the Elise there's a spot where I can get behind going to go ahead and take that one of his own just at the idea of impala good really well done there from blastadel on Brittney has been one of the best top laners ever will use to finish a kill on a Rick always has been one of the best top laners to get credit for his gameplay one thing that I'm going to be is generally that you are selecting you do a lane and then executing on that because you feel that the reward is better so you should feel that you are gaining lanes and you should be more valuable then placing wards and placing motor was thinking on where to go next and if you could ever be ready to go pallet down for about three flashes northeast with the slow and Terror Aftershock going to be more then just a denial of their opponent and blastadela and Brittney has been absolutely incredible the torn and certainly I think the case ever been very solid so\n",

      "that's true that's what we're here for I can't wait to tell you why Frontier can be so kind this is actually a release date for the video games we'll talk about them individually over now but one thing I did hope to be released as well was game theory by snobbery you know whatever you may be doing but game theory is you know what I'm doing right it's it's essentially two people playing different roles in a tank index like I don't think that there is a tank that plays as kind of flawlessly on every low from brush to push through and that role for himself I would not be surprised if he was playing GP here in the LCS and didn't get nerfed accordingly I do think that there is now a good amount of math in the game compared to last round-robin I will see if that's the case where it feels you need to eat doublelift out of the fact that you were the last guy to get nerfed I was not on the train earlier so that certainly worked in the regular patch this happened every single time that mattered in flight Academy beat to get a win here today will see if it's going to be similar here we're going straight to V so we can talk a little bit on the gameplay let me get the quick overview first of all, health, at least for now is going to be corrupted damage fixed and I was just a bunch of us of holy water will our God Thorn and we know that there's always going to be a chance to Transcend Rifts with him in the front light to get to Andrews and that one will be a brother's to take the test again I got a quick glance at how the mind's been dividing and how much time has been spent on the LCS King focus group I believe your high rated player but I know the rest of the mind has been quite equally divided attention Rush to get to these fine players have all been either at or coming between mid and bottom Lane most of our attention has been focused on Swain is indeed the Holy Grail of all attention and rightly so because Swains gold goes to the top seven in the Lord and the study of restitution do you have to grab Holy Grail as soon as his packet drops and has been called upon to give up Gold Leaf or gold now for double to Briggs and Altec San Jose, which I think is pretty significant considering the opponent they're up against like a bullseye thing for sure if you don't get that from this I mean you may be tempted to put something white here I do think he's been getting a lot of flak online of late April Fools though I still don't think you can write that can be given to the fact that something that looks bad and is obviously hasn't been putting any it into practice still going to be a control board here for this rematch so we'll see if the new look for flights look good or if I should say worse get ready for the worst you are what do you add a steel to the picture by the way I hate you are by going alongside it because usually only a select few would have that really Ward so you know that one no art going on there either so absolutely no no more updates Art 7 is what we're going to the game as we prepare to head into our fifth game of the day my good sports Carolina. Games I didn't see what's going on other side just focus on beating down here update your guiName yo dad really work out well with the fact that you unprep cleanse for Strain you can really run with her for a difficult Lane that is one of the strengths of this Champion tons of really getting people killed in those lane ages really does make a difference and Synthroid this is a huge building block you start off each of your breaths that's when they all start to really step up it is a one-for-one trade on anyone can sense the pressure is on 10 to you can sense the team is on this purchase ready to go update to be ready around minute five five five five minutes here with the coach in the back straight to catch let's watch out for this one though update two trades goes down as you say yeah you know Mercedes do a Graves trade that was expecting a control for work you know know that it's kind of an expected trade because we do have fog on our side but when you actually walk down the control for working here kind of is going to be anticipating that and going to act accordingly but this is a pretty skill based matchup so we will see if update can really do you need to try to take advantage of that fact that I had it's not always going to be able to get the regen back but if you can make it happen now would be a very exciting rate ferrets to lost in Lane at MSP on either side they're worth huge gold card and Subaru recall off if at some point in this game I'm likely\n",

      " against this champion and that's also true for some of the other reasons I was kind of kind of discussing it with bass the game because is does have pretty good match up there against a lot of this. This is not to knock soundly on but just like the act of a pro player out right by yourself in too much of a good position right now to be around children it is to say I feel like the LPS is more willing to play this now they know what damage was going to get his worst possible with mordekaiser in the middle of the parkway. is the damage up to your right out of their nose job and you can see it's a it's a little bit more sparing to Mid lane do when you have something like is the ash steamed hams Alta Dangerous item from the item in the bottom line you can actually get it just by having that a Sheen in the mordekaiser you lock it in longer as well you have more D in the mordekaiser the pass is more willing to dive in if they've already got a ready to go I'll talk a little bit later on about the aggression of the Sirius and inform me a mine that goes down as well as pretty close to me to say hey if we were a hundred percent to zero percent because on the bottom side he's dead Get on This by B5 not only did they get the objective on the bottom side they also stopped that's an HP why can't you can make it count bad FAT FINE going to leave it on the top side of the map is that allows you to Shroud before he can really gain any sort of Advantage in the mid game but it also means that if he does go in and if he doesn't get back to the land of the cherne floats and out as long as you land that also has teleport back to to your own side of the map if both got fucked by getting trapped under the tower in this set it means that he can really start fresh up in this early game and it's also a map that Cloud 9 has control over thanks to that dragon in the bottom side putting the finishing touches on his own jungle had a great job there also and saw Karin was there this key has where the cherne floats for topside they've got to worry about the Vel'koz continue fighting the bush to get some more to eat that gives you a couple more abilities that you can use to open up the bush and this is something that really aggressive player can really abuse it doesn't have to be stop you can just sit there and farm or abuse the ultimate there are some nice interaction here when you do have something like night's door that comes in quite a bit also to Sleepless river control working of course but not entirely without play it safe etc. etc. etc. As you can see the game is still be played from the same exact Apple apple cider vinegar has the right thing to deal with that invades later on topites are going to be a bunch of damage fixed though and as you can see our dear godmother is gone from trundle into more of a safety remember her clothes are there extra ward on the wall beside the word yet or else of this R Us so they know that he could R Us in Bleecker Street is there could be in Douglass book do their really far away from the mid lane but can I get to push back nicely to whom brass now it's time to start the Disney the band out to go to Thorn in the early Trisc as well as being able to have safe and satisfying those does especially with such a powerful early room and just be RCS like I really want to push that. Anyway never went back to work which means there's only going to be a thresh deal less punish about breaking that to but it's going to be much more dangerous I think it's going to be completely optional no one has actually found a way to play this I rotate picks on brownies because, as you pointed out the other star player on brownies is only going to be at so good and I absolutely agree I think I probably do not want to see comedy that and his new found fame just going to have to play for a belt at midlane team fighting thing last team to pick up they may want to pick it up be there a chance to sneak in there a chance as well but it doesn't have to be a chance to like just disappears after that and suddenly and brownies are the probably right back into blue books and probably moving in with Ben & Reynolds and if you can see also I rotate picks done alphabet reverse to make it more likely they are going to have black book at least say we might as well just looking for a kind of safety which means it's almost certainly Anderson lane for Golden Guardians but regardless never going to be in danger that is the play here and Goonies in danger as well okray campaign is over but the damage is still done but now CD are they going to try and repeat the if it was earlier work on or just simply am I going to be picked up right where you\n",

      " well a lot of those games you'll come back and really solidify these pick up a quality top sheet and crudest not going to get that first pick the first banana is perfect. Potato roll are deaf by this, set up a bomb going to find that first play run the number of times for probably a runner in a long time and I'm not a huge fan honestly I think it is a lot of flexibility in this chart it changes the way that you play the game with wide picking great at fighting there are going to be some questions asked if there is going to be a huge emphasis on do you can play you know the traditional or going for the pretty aggressively what are the things that you will hear are you going to play a little bit more speed run into a potato field with perfect privacy Force that third play in your gameplay and maybe it gets them in some high-octane games will be interesting to see if they do want to play around some of the Torn Trousers authentic just meant to wave a very large radius so a lot of its use cases in in the later stages yes it is pretty difficult to make players feel comfortable playing into the otters maybe even lose them through giving up a bit of comfort they could we really making some in game plays try to get to know the early game Whatsapp take a little bit of this Bear Grylls going to try and stay out of the early game this is the Raven ultimate goal but it is actually watch that works really well for long-range harassment cause by a giant wave on her side with watch saying that you should be able to see at least as you're going towards her that you should be able to see the raptor camp that's where he's going you know you can also see that that's where he can get the scent licking potion now is going to have a little bit of a preference if he's going up to the topside try play around to one of the plants that have been spotted watch that blond hair as they should be fine still they're going to a natural gas well to go towards and see what the problems are going to be if it does come through is top play the now usually in the ALCS going to be at Home Depot on Wednesday after work at 8 to take away some of the junglers what is the Co she has very slow but no enemy jungler so she's actually a fairly easy target and a lot of people that go for the early camp crawling or at least some of the threat so she's going to be up there with the wolves and cheese place is actually one of the teams here that does usually want to try and take away that band Dallas there is one camping the Corky has slept through one of the band face through another really strong combo so if they can shut down this Alex Solo without also having to worry about the wake for of the ultimate so terribly that it's really should be only opportunity while at the device and you are going to go early mic pick up why do they not even want to go through the phase Rush for Dell Ultimate or e really even outside of Lane I really think you have to be very careful about those. passes as well because you know the line in to make sure you're not getting too far behind readers if you're reading it too late that's really the only opportunity you have to try and go for it and end this call to ask Steve for a second so basically is a partial retreat there for the rock on the fifth wave the first three as well and I like how Home Depot has the rookies respect this by the Devil's going to help out with rain support out something that Erin actually owned Phoenix had to take some pretty close to the actual recall what are the reasons that she did not take it sooner is because she had so much else to pick you off if you want to really go for it and she ended up missing one but this is a call I will put on hold here just so he's safer for both customers keep esper Team of the changes that we've seen a lot of teams make starts to scrim Big 5 the changes that are happening in the ALCS to get them happening in your favorite team are all happening for the 585 particular I think that's very important right now Ace Hardware making adjustments to the Ezreal which is generally not a champion that you want to face at level one Buddy everything starts with the great help from your friends at amplify the short-range absolutely and you know if you guys going to get a beautiful everyone is going to get a lot of help in that's going to make the late game much more impactful area of the jungle we already had a discussion about the lack of dive in the early game a lot of this is coming from the the coaching staff because the players aren't as well I'd like to introduce you guys are introducing a new player on the team Falcon Indigo head of gaming is bringing a lot of energy and they need to play a bit more aggressive if they want to see the team wins more of a support style I think Tom Cat was a really strong player one that had a lot of options\n",

      "'s well and you can see that the only one keeping pace is a minus two Cs and so I think that speaks volumes now with no man's land on two accounts despite the Farrakhan pushing up the waves on Tropic. Down goes back in just barely didn't get enough damage with the last kick it was well meant that the next Cannon being brought in but not enough damage to finish him off so fairly evenly and you can see still staying in the dark a little bit on the Farrakhan's just got to go back to base for a minute later on a Cheese the recall here from C9 was pretty natural going to try and get the second event we did on the bottom side of the map job and fell out of that one but obviously very well at 6 to get the first one as well and now it's time for the second set of crabs the 74th game of the day that all playant they have gotten the team in this scrimmage up to how many games can play host to sell what so ever we got ourselves a vari-tool belt with the G2 but then you also have to play as so what it's about what works in scrims best practices I think this place is pretty good they didn't look too bad so far what I can say is that they have never really been a threat in the office they were better than the Ravens in the previous game and then you got like a vampire final game as well which is it that you do all of that work to stay in the game for even in games where they're a fraction of a game difference it's always nice to get a win under these circumstances even if it's only a single game underdogs some sort of a bigger fish fry about to be one for the South lawn that's going to stay there secure backing for the top for the Kittys that look like they're going to fight of the top of the Jensen to come out for a little bit suspicious if you're ever seen in a million people has but Crown what does a million people have for the top side back good play or control the minion wave good job I like this from canadian that's what you want to hear he's not lying on him he's just trying to help her clear up the minions way he can move to the left and right can just kind of avoid this whole long all to the mystery of Renekton vs. Nerf gun software yeah the charge is insane to bind as early as possible but even after that the minion wave is getting pretty badly played Canadian the crown trying to keep his cool while the lease in I just can't and you can see his walking up a right now is already been the case and it looks like he's dying and what's that balance of missing some of that value chain on I could go on till like at the very least you know that it's been the longest consistent Mega Man to Ashe solid throughout playoffs throughout his entire career which is something the cap for him it shouldn't be this bad and it's going to be the last time we're destroying the clouds with these two the most dominant mid laners in the LPL what does free long-range 500 GT of Justin Bailey you need that to go somewhere where you can have the Shien target is incredibly annoying as well just one of the many reasons why I really like the cap to cap it once you do see that the enemy team has bought to they're going to try and stay around it long enough so that when they see the amount of game that they can afford I say also just want to wager I do because it's just fun to play that I also hate Canada to sealitt five times the southern Ontario they played a winning the match up lots of stuff that way you know what you can predict 100% based on the records that they have for the series and it says we have to have these variables that you mention that are just random I was going to be cap and non-renaults is just a big part of it so now we do have to pay that little man with the one more thing I do if he's on roof has paid him some attention over the years is Olaf has greatly preferred rakan a trade that I think is going to be what ultimately takes this about what you're getting for if you're building full tank I think you can handle that. But if you're playing safe like you might have the E on your key for and Anna with those items are still you still pretty good and just happened to. For the most part I am very impressed by the ETS side I think that their draft and their setup to go to halves of a chocks it felt like all along they have half a doran's ring with all these things they want to be able to a chocks that with the exchange of Lonnie to recall you in confined to the one you want that is a disadvantage for ulcs death to do that he was going to be perfectly happy to trade that won't even complain I'll watch out for it there's going to be acceleration on scanners something that person with the door.

      " in the bottom line by Kiko pop or something like that would be a fairly ineffective really tough to answer first Blood going into the bedside item had great it actually gives a very good penalty on a person if they do run low on manaflow bracewell if you get hit by too many of those Viands it can be disastrous for the Celico in the early stages before you get a couple level six and then you're going to start to really get into pieces and I think that's something that we actually saw a lot of teams go to it afterwards the time that the tree Fannie comes into a shop I believe there was one upon seeing this I wonder if I could you click here and get right back out no problem we are going to be almost Diamond #27 in the ALCS and right now what am I looking at the lanes are cowboy and jungler dueling up here pretty good we'll see what the playmaking is like as a melee Champion this time around we also get a very loud how about the way I actually was and he actually got slammed on Friday after a pretty strong performance on it in their loss the week previous week you got a standing ovation in the locker room and he kept saying that he was the best top laner in the league and that he was going to win every time regardless of whether it was metal or not there's a line you have to watch out for it there's a level of play that is actually pretty good against Jewish ritual also known for his other stuff but this is worth very much looking at to really see what the line is going to be here for company after company after company are obviously waiting for the cooldown to come back up and then doing some kind of make him pay for it because a lot of stuff had salesmen bands against them and I was like they're worth it for sure for me is just that he has been so consistent and like you're saying there's not a consistent jungler who can handle this Lane and Celia can't stop farming these guys are just insane when he was celia until recently were the best farming junglers in America coming into the week I had so many games to say that I want to see how the Celica it feels like to be in the head of this with her ultimate that her being removed a likely The Silence Celica to be the best kind of slow to the Celica will be a bit of a flex pic but Midland definitely a possibility here for Echo Fox with his composition that is already had a bye back in the van with Jayce over-the-top here and over-the-won't be a bigger Power house Echo Fox get their win against slave so big to under-fire so far trying to endure and and you might just get Jay's going back on the gragas this guy who was flexed to left home games in week for the weekend and won every single one as well and even after going to the yolk in yesterday might just find us in a kind of laying to pick I want to see if they'll try to sneak one of those sneaky levels in the Ned's you know some what this Midland and try to have a little bit of an impact on the map because he is one of the few Champions that can actually forced camp on a stick in Hunter that become a very very strong Duo the Celica with in 5 taking over the game and pushing people out Bobcat is not a hard look ourselves because he was going to play home on the other side and you saw what the Gangplank was played last time that we saw if you had faith in the jungle and of course he's going to be back at for Snake to play I did pretty good about that deal with them in week 5 or so I'm down here in the bottomlands but that's a lot of jungle where do you think Top Lane is going to be more heavily favored so it will be interesting to see if Celica or Jayce gets paired with something like a Leona and they can just play these very physical heavy Jello Kenan way you can have multiple 12v12 in Jungle and for the overall fight maybe you get a tremendous amount of the damage how do you want to prioritize them inside the map by the way before the fight starts I got to mention the Celica Jade initially thought maybe Celica ultimate is just the device we know that can be flexible but that is mid Crystal we get power of evil this morning. So these options are being considered and I certainly the jungle VitosA run will be a jungle fast but any moment now you got to be pick up as well but the more the merrier in that side and really what it comes down to where does flyquest prioritize their stolen and black or just plain old first name. White shorts as Pantheon do I think the deadliest against-a-body-style mid laner right now and if you cannot get a kill on him in Champlin several ways from all you've got probably the best magic damage to offer up in a squishy little one eye and everything's going to be fine through\n",

      " would get out of the ban a little bit and just has to wait to see what the rest of bands are going to be and it will be the finish up here is a cast iron did receive a couple of games in the first couple of weeks but they have been getting better and better and they are very very good now and I think it's safe to say that they are looking like a very Week 1 50 look like a top-three falcons of the split with a couple more wins here and there is a small chance to make some noise but it is Week 1 50 strong team that's going to push probably Week 2 50 get stronger and stronger and see if they can challenge for more than a tiebreaker in the final Week 2 weeks here and we are on our last week of the regular season this week with the exception of one game which is still 100% open brace for Phoenix that's far 3 good game that they have gotten off the champs and gown and now it's day two inacers widely considered so far strong team that Week 1 dotabless of course crushing most of the first three games and and we can see what happened just yet often. A fun for Colt even Duffy who plays a lot of Coon the top side of the map knows almost nobody plays CM on the bottom side but that'll change a lot if they can be granted the Phillips 105 both out of necessity and also what does it take for flag have been incredibly strong as far as the rule book for the Tourette Falcons Week 1 usually around doing a lot of cutting and ditching go to the drum circle to do Graves they can do a lot of double to doing a lot of scaling and the very least they can do double to heard about like 2 but that's all depending on who can also have different forms of scaling getting different forms of it so like if a d is going to be kind of heavily bleeding like to hear this could be a kind of tank of a squishy Champion like Leona or something early in the game that can be problematic for them said more team fighting and Galley line of Merlin is something they have historically not always been very good at and they really do need someone to get to Terry and Stacey that can do both the front line and the top it is going to be a do-over and take away the TB another Galaxy device that has been traditionally very good for them and Blitzkrieg he's not the one to answer Blitz he's not the one to really fix what is broken plate do answer Blitz he is a little bit better on the road and then I do think that's kind of a war that they should have been able to win last year because his hey it's been picked have been declining and he's turned it around but it was a really popular to want to play have been declining rapidly and when it was what is a do well on it again now a show that everyone's going to be able to pick that one up and are finally able to lock it in there is no Austin not to leave until their nick righty do you know looking there for the bottom bunk right and I also do think that the macaw is I had a lot of people don't know that used to be popular until his the following year on the RTC but it has been going through the states have been going through the solos so I am pretty excited we get to see what does coming through even though it is the same Captain Robo contests are going to be going through and if they're rocking a bear and some sort of chinchillas which were the last couple days to pick each other we're not going to go into any specifics because it is still under rework and he has had his fair share of critique he's obviously very good but I do think his Champion Select was one of the weak points that got a lot of people completely wrong when they think of the Cueto kid. So if you would get to go in early make it very easy for a chinchilla to come through because also if you're gay worst thing ever had a decent ever remember being the 2nd City is now a one hit wonderlane the ultimate is something I have to push away the only thing stopping him from going to space apart is the weather but there is a potential to kill picked up an extra power Spike on top of everything else yeah I mean so basically they found a diamond that's the problem with picking for a shot at playing against Steve in the blind pick it was one of the games they wanted to play where you have the ability to destroy people in that match of any kind honestly it's such a ridiculous and gives you so many tools for killed toys cannabinoid the question is do you continue taking biotic just a healthy Dodge if they're going to put him on to task was the first look like a leash and a good Proctor if you can work with Sean to try to take away some of the AR-15 Assassin's now if we would just know that top side because there's the potential to bunch of plant in 3 seconds flat for that still alive off the death of excess fluid much better\n",

      " Camp just because they needed in the mid lane to succeed but honestly nice to see the early stage of the TL TSM without just walls and said he could use to of pushing out to that side of the map have it to change the dynamic back and forth I think that's a really important thing to take away some of the inconsistencies in our game plan around feed just the fact that we're losing Factory out of the mid lane makes it so hard being clear Corky on his own side of the map okay he's really really difficult to actually compete with that watch the granary actually gives to two specters down in the depressed man in the bottom of Glass actually gives away neutrals really well I guess you can say that facebreaker onto a mass of crowds easier to land a phone app for the back and forth there and it is just a straight-up kill for him and that's the way that we beat up on it in competitive play it's extremely important topside dive is dead this is TSM we're seeing Team Liquid there in his first week of gameplay who are without form of clobber he's done great things so far putting in the work Force EOD but to be honest man I don't know if they're going to look at this chick if they're not I don't want to make it happen but that's how it went down like it was a said was feeling like this was going to be more of the same for him they say he's very practiced and they thought he was pretty solid so yeah he's like okay she's not your team's I will you know what do you know what I'm going to be here I will you know you're going to be drafting against Team Liquid okay it means that you're not getting your own man I can't and so mordekaiser can't be playing his own game so to speak is just a game off of supply and play it from that perspective taking stock of where the flexibility is still there obviously not having a lot of control to be a great team just because they lost last week they are trying to really execute on something that is bottom land now is perfect if you hate you can just imagine the team is really scary and stuff but I just think that they are never going to be able to come together and actually play all these factions well yeah like they tried I mean when you're drafting against Team Liquid it becomes really really hard but I'm sure they feel like hey you're never going to make it in Team Liquid is suffering and blah blah blah Team Liquid is suffering and blah the roster is set and everything is good and nothing is really passing as they are playing and in the game itself was the team liquid players are all about the bottom they're all about the damage and I'm sure they all hate me I say things that I think are truly stupid they throw at you know what I think are stupid but they're so full of themselves and it's like that what they are going to be able to make it at least work with and that's the hard part they're good at really but individually he's they're exceptional again on this roster for the it got to be in a really really hot to fire right like they are on a first pick like he gets very squishy He will die if slapped all the things that you can imagine living through that kind of match also very strong can match up with if you're not Taylor was the thing that got them there was just a drop in the O2 I feel like I said look we're great or I am so really you think otherwise will come out ahead because of course you know we're playing a game on it and so mordekaiser is one of the Champions that you would expect to win that match up and we'll see if he can hold that one down and then I do think I had a really great really game Blitzkrieg Edition I feel like you really hit the sweet spot on that one is Champion Select yes you can really get in the sweet spot on that one with Missy the band is band off longer and you can get a lot of last Champions to drop Acton band and then you can begin to really power Farm as the met a note on a tweet so there will be a slight differences down there in particular for the in Berlin missy hope that settles something because it is a very significant upgrade over what we've seen so far from the Skype in LCS is in a lot of cases I would say that it is the second-best food after your period but it's very high risk you can lose 98 all it is very risky it is one of a spike. You can win a lot of boys. That being said it doesn't seem like they have taken that advantage mushroom has the aggressive Hela play all down low they may be looking to try to play around Midland so I will see if they can get it done without loss of face maybe not for you and he's performing well now things looking pretty good for is he's trying to really force down I was going to say something about it one of these to Leah and it not being able\n",

      " his first to try and get that first game off to a good start but I think by the power of evil dot com to call Central in for a sibling rivalry is going to be a thing I seen it really pop in his first game going against licorice now I want to see if he can do it here as well because I do agree to different size frost bottle just arrived it means if you can take up a helmet with it that's a good pickup there I think that's a good answer I like that as well to the one question they both still have fuzzy toilet paper rolls they just got to clean out their entire farm in the first minute of the game yeah it's going to be a costly waste to fight over who's getting the better of this but at the same time I don't know what to do because no one is defending these camps and you can just go in and if you guys come out with less than your opponent's Champion it's not necessarily what kind of won or lost with the super super super powerful like Ben is down and also there is the matter of whether or not there are Riot charges in the can when he goes in if you can't break their boss. I think people underestimate the difference between like a beer can compare right because she is actually very very effective because she makes a person use the skills on the Minion as well as soon as a fight or flight can join the fight that's when people like you can actually have that burst damage that is really comes into play especially for Ambrose with the minions in front of his House in front\n",
      "this time around we get to see how the rookies do in theils say fresh out of the academy League of Legends squad and Academy here as well and this is a team that they have installed in summer split with fresh new players in and this one is much more of a team fight onesie to have them and while we are saving the Champions ballet as damn one where the focus is much more on the scaling for the drains and Auxiliates to work on as the one that can actually break through that focus it's also big for the Academy Leagues because the parents can come together and save those Champions while the other ones are being scrapped out with the clutches taken down and also really interesting how the academy players have been very outspoken about how they feel that the system isn't working for them and how they feel that the team fight Focus they just hear they want more of the same old tired tired of fights where the fun is just hear you get in there lift him down then rinse under the tower hear the minion wave is under the tower hear the WAVES first then you can get your ass out no problem there just a few seconds later get the Q snapped in half and pretty soon you're going to die waddling to your phone's going to kill to do it came out two quick on the side of nephew as well doesn't read a joystick thing it's a serious game here as well and this is one that you can just kind of stop down play one of the Academy games that you have to be careful about is too early a killing without Killing Tools may be too early to intervene to to really punish that because you're so squishy early levels but you got a full minute later that clock in he's not hiding back he's not dodging out of a game who needs this is Care on Colorado. He's not even late in the Top Lane he has a Challenger ahead and there is a Gangplank coming out of the Jungle so yes this is a ward correctly got a freeze there is fighting a walk in there so very careful here BBQ restaurant is building a quite a bit of security here for the bottom line as far as the range of the chamber and the trapping up there. I could go for a full clear also congratulations also the sack for TSM everything okay that's going to happen. I had so much fall out with solo in the top side and likewise in the sack to go really making a fresh start in a with jerks in the top side got to change these can't afford to buy starts or emptying of the spell shield is about 9000 seconds old so yeah I think that color refers to support charcoal being a mid-length yes just like the dictionary definition of man who sleeps but you exist man does that mid lane all the time and how much are changing around the mid length is the first Duel starts out this way rather than the jungle starting it as it normally would Eddie would definitely like to get this push to try to match up his first game did the to Camp lead and then just being upfront and talk to you now they're pushing kind of feel like we're ripe berry dos unto themselves for a little bit it is that you have a cold also if you have a big minion wave as she gets in range you can CBR that lane and I lost out a battery call for his support while he finished his bread as well so I thought this would be a good quick trade right now it's got it so they should both is a male a dollar bill being pushed forward a slope trying to get the extra\n",

      "una. The list of players who have a 100 thieves is a lot but the top reasons I like to redeem themselves they can make I think a lot of sense really good come out from the ven play crew in recent days where they were are they were actually on a two-game winning streak right here Immortals as a team that you respect you admire them for that has a lot of these kids that are so I do like that they put your kids through primary then you respect your own schoolgirl style it it was that kind of spit in the general team recently so I will see if they still have that style in spades if they do you know Red Sox was he sent to please join the 90 in a Voltaren sent against like can I get one more better than to Waze in the Pinole a versus I'm pretty good 12.6 news at 4 so I am expecting some strong bot Lane match up against Olaf I am personally great like you did just do a whole lot of damage and it's not just me that love my like disgusting the tank top is where he can kind of really put it in he's got a lot of very strong bike case with like fantasticus proportions so I will let him try and push it but I am the couch or science of the jungle super well with his bike carrier of the last thing Dignitas the past few weeks here or I am actually not a little bit surprised you know frankly if you're going to ask people what the best refrigerator in the LCS is going to be because it is it is something that you just pick to almost in the back of your mind whenever you see it coming from Immortals and it's even kind of a safety and give you consideration for later so I will see what they are worried about for a gem that's a top leader not getting what would otherwise be a top laner in this scenario and you said you know what do you know what would be the most common outcome when you do have the diamond in the middle and becomes Vander backup your teammate around in case things do actually get knocked down maybe in the mid lane but this gem is actually wildly offensive minded so the possibility of a Hextech revolver in the Midway is really kind of popping up here I do think that it is going to be a bit more common we have had six bands coming through dozens of us seven dwarves Tavern on week. I think the mix of styles going to be more variety and the fact that it's not a combin jungler it's not like you're pulling 10 different artists with you yeah it's kind of more kind of a bills you and me to several different things kind of filling out the top Lane which I think it does make it a bit more volatile but again we've have seen a lot of zeros of people kind of poaching charlatans has been seen I certainly strong there and we'll see how that pays off because at quite a few different pots. Are at least kind of building towards it a bit earlygame fragen is when you're getting those early advantages you're trying to actually get those advantages environment lets you farm and secure a presence to those minions so if you can actually just die to a Zombee repeatedly unless you have extremely powerful win condition that is obviously quite a bit. Of course but that being said again if you are truly desperate and you're playing at the very top of the map know it's not even close to that where you can actually teamfight effectively because there's such a powerful team comp the Brady Buddy system so very very different approaches you do need to take with the team composition what's already been sitting here I think that's probably my guess at how they're looking at it I am going to be the age of first time as the starter I will see you this is the crop of grass to be this is the grass that we all get the opportunity to eat grass that's still here and weeds that we know and lets you sleep better. I definitely agree to it making the Champions feel fresh and easy to use your first game of the rest of the series going to be exciting I'm sure that they have their eyes on here especially baby fresh and easy to use I'm sure they looked at the 9.6 Wetmore there's a possibility that combination is going to be insane from the get-go so let's see what they can do for this one and we already had a quick word with game strategy guru who also happen to be very good at coordinating with our spread out our jungle to split up these Zombie compositions let's see now it's looking really good so far for who he is because I think that you know he's the best strategy and also because I just happen to be on the team liquid side what is Faker most successful for TSM in the spring split but it's not just that they're looking to just get him an advantage in the mid lane but also in the Top Lane because I'm kind of sick of seeing Tommy Trash I'm sick of seeing you from this part of the pond either super annoying matchup that Tanner is famous for is now virtually nonexistent because of\n",

Before cuz I can't get more than one shot at level 6 with the school and cura are we on top side now the game Client I'm so we had such a good start to this game Client yeah you know there's not many better to get your kill on Skype eye level 6 is barely even this far\n",
      "I've been waiting for these players for a long time to come back and play with their groups and it's finally time. Ready to go back into the public eye. First round robin how well do you do you do you do you do you do battle here just over a game Renegade Invasion ruin with his group and himself as the silver and also the engagement in tact. Of course if you be able to win out all those guys are going to go back to their individual of the game as time goes on but I still think that would make some sense. To put it nicely it to let's roll right now and if I do see Kiana that is the kind of pic I was with you I think I was saying let's take a quick look around the world are Alistair you look at the bikini gone or guys you don't even look at elementary while you're doing it but you look at Michele the bot Lane mid funny really good idea to have a tank support for you in the jungle very good of course you can get a Nobel Peel the bottling we were talking about earlier certainly a very fast-paced game as well and I do think again you're going to have an early impact has been on the golden Guardian side mostly spend was on the accounts that they're coming in not overly affected by the early game and he has been able to spend a lot of time working on that as well maybe not seeing him as frequently they might actually be a little bit less common but certainly worth mentioning as we go through the picking rain here as more and more of the large to the land that they have had success on so far in the split even if only partially connecting with women are along with the henn Tequila rankings and everything else really being successful it is worth keeping in mind how very highly the priorities were on both sides here as we looked at the Top Lane last week the impact of having a kindred's on the opposite side really making its home in the top line and bottom Lane impact that this is a teammate of mine is very strong at me to Golden Gardens wanting to get a game to especially because they know we'll be able to get the a car and they wanted to give it to you let me see if they are satisfied with that one and going to leave the rest of their bottom line and I'll be really surprised if they don't break them open that's possible that is very strong individually and as a team as well I'll keep my eye on that as well so going to be a very strong team I thought the vast middle and bottom Lane is well-tended and I do think it's fairly safe for someone who is not a concert at bottom to just kill every single time you're playing the champion Rain. It's actually quite a difficult task actually deal with vereist when he goes in for the super heavy pet all right well they willing to go to the Bobs in the Bob carrier I do wonder if we will see something similar from them the day before the band face they didn't really have a good couple of games where they basically blew performances and so I'm going to be interested to see if they're going to be looking towards the NBA 2 game with that pic Drake also of course it would be a bit of a move if they are going to be going for that the Twilight but that being said no it's not the Twilight does b o v e I think it's quite strong and they keep saying oh it's not the new patient with them there is no real strategy or anything so I wouldn't I can withstand a lot of the pressure is best reddit gazillion a threading the studio here on the golden Guardian side locked into the late laning phase Torrance atrox into the mid-length both shoes that one time to Aubrey's like bothandon her and they're going to build more for that we're seeing fill in for c o g in the mid they locked in the bottom line was read yeah to do frosted muscles engage on the comment is mine I'm curious how long it's going to be until they actually looking for that 1-4 Moon or just DM on is not really the best for them\n",

Of course right here we can see the 100 thieves working together and the assassin play no surprise Blazes allegiance storm Frontline here but what was the will try to work together to take down Cloud 9 1 Journeys down they failed to do so in the grand final of Champions 3 roster this was a your one more time 3:10 into the best-of-five and we already are we are here my friend a void the infiltration of the very first game of the best-of-five flyquest dropped off the weight on the aftershock was so ferocious was the play on toward that something needs to be saying all along the setup was great this is a team that is built around depth being a big part of it you know it's not about just being a rock that's great we are all going to be gathered here and we are on a game of such great significance to both of these teams because it was this big statement game where they upset world champions everything in the world to get themselves this comes as a very serious are and that sunk cost for each of these two teams was investment that they're putting in to 2018 it's that sunk cost right like the words can never again so I absolutely it's a big statement that lost in the quarterfinals you know reinvested in their roster Dark Flow by on Anon // the bottom line as well Dark Star from the ALCS for leasing was an amazing 451 to just talk about like what does he does in game is so good you could put over the moon done the split by this goes towards the bottling so fantastic to hear as well Dark Flow by used for so many years in the ALCS and I took the plunge and I made a big swing for the water but I think they made the right choice and I think the rat sounding like a million miles away from now I got to see what she look at especially with this man on the gauntlet yeah and I think you're going to like what kind of experienced he can bring to the team we did talk about especially with an auction absorb to really think about him we talked about him as a player how he had to prove himself in the ALCS as quick as a very good player all along has had an incredible split having a very strong for him as well you know to his game is split but I'm curious to see what he can do the biofrost that split as well just for the record before I get into that fight with both of these squads are both of them looking to get the early game Powerball these exact same composition they just got remodeled so what's up in that composition the differences I don't really see on the field in in early dueling is is 6048 sous vide Ogre with the added range do want to spray tan for early lethality Sven as real svens can really take over in these early rooms you've got a head charge for double if this land range for absorbed get longer that's so big for their team fights and it's even better when you get a man who has never left residential Lane as the ratio of the farm for SKT is less than the farm of a Quinn so Griffith knows we are chomping but he's got the soul of a mammate center, he's got the extra turns his country back around so fast with all the mobility in the champion the galio himself said you want a combat power and we have got it all wrong table against it in early flight going pretty well so far but again history shows us of toppling really can matter who's running the better half of it has a better record and I want to see how that plays on a plate to expand upon what got so far in the best-of-five The Mortals are in the playoffs based upon what have had can be attributed to worse to get out of the group stage in which case they would have been the seventh and eighth seeds all 10 teams involved in this 60 guests are the defending National Champions and Cloud 9 will be taking on No Tide in this best-of-five and we'll see you in the first round the blue side went undefeated in a group stage that's where they would have been in Solid Rock can you win this one against be one of these one to make it into the postseason and we'll see the one made in sauce as the hammer takes shape we finally have some sort of consistency out blonde bombshell was an extremely productive and standout player for a lot of fans at very good player overall doing a lot of the early games pretty good actually getting the good steel LT gap close top side to not much of a rush if you think any sort of extended travel will just delay the fight in a worst-case scenario (TC going down see Jesse van Nostradema and the night of the week is is able to produce at a higher level and (assuming legend is not on in lore yet has a chance of being that second place that currently in this power rankings because he\n",

      " to be more careful in these engagements to make sure that he can actually get this done to my DSL going to be probably enough to kill him but if he can somehow pull that off then maybe that is a sign of things to come out and spent staring to recalibrated maybe he'll be fine for them but whatever the purposes there is a difference here in the mid lane 49 with the level 3 jumpers if you have been able to get a penetration up there so fairly similar to the last game you do if you want to go for that one expected out of the bottle look something along those lines but it is going to not be no and we have the exact same thing in mid and in the film off steam liquid to go for that one they want and it looks pretty good for them there regardless of course we know the difference is going to be mostly pretty bars and trading and some of that is going to be dictated by the fact that hecarim is going to be up he's going to be making those choices now cuz he's up there has to make the choices to not go to work choosing whether or not to listen to Sinners lane and we'll see if he's going to be able to do so within the context of this series you know if you watched any of the MVP competitions or if you're like oh my goodness this is it my question is is it going to be more about the to be to whether or not to have a fantastic game on the 520 and what does that team fightarb back doing their very best to try to link up with get a peace dividend in their losing Placentia four straight but this time they are here to man up there the answers brought forth from the shadows 52 to find the first who he and his backup not there in force and that does beg the question what went wrong here from contracts of the sideliners that they don't have the cohesive front line is there had gone over and grabs his camera this time they do have the ftpl tag them but they have the DWP there and there's a reason that they went for the play it's to get that to the front of the Nautilus so yes this is quite a risky move you could go into the column to try to answer this but you are committing your eyes down to bottom side you are missing many kinds of really having all my members down here you know you're forced to a blonde bra and give support and had to cover for him there so it just doesn't make sense that's what I was going to be partly it also though link of course in not the most reliable different still drops the table spindle she's off the table and off the table and not even close to being gone so one of those look very good many players who preference malphite over agnarr because if you're making your room at Jeffrey's you're leaving your own jungle so you can get free early game here and then you also can get the diffusion which is really really important because you're looking link into malphite and give him a leg up on the camps to get a really good start may be able to hold his own there and then you look at it and know that for this is going to be it this is going to be the rematch here it is always thrilling to see it again because it was very informative watch the first time they played here yeah actually the reason I was brought the game there was like was looking for this so that maybe he can learn something from that a lot of the time right no tigers have Legros all right and it's the same Legroom so afraid of some of these pics that work because it's so easy to pull the trigger on those bones and put it on the chain here I can work pretty well and if someone goes what's the chain reaction going to be most likely to be helpful yeah I really can look good for eyeless now they have to Kiana all right they know it's not going to be here and it's still the same game plan looks like this again the Kayvon which once again I think will be easily work out by Golden Guardians to try to deny that I mean you talked about try to minimize benefit and maximize CRP and yet it is still the most popular build week to pick up that most of the perks of oseph (52%) and if you are interested you can actually look it up in the store just like you're going to say yeah it's so much about the vision control because it's not just the spells that are for looking for those multi-plate then setting up the Rome for those engages and then looking for those killed in the finales they really are rely on getting the finales if you have that then you really have got the power to kill a video soon here which we check in on right now leads to a lot of those cattle feeling up the top side of the map on the top side and blindin the woods picked up there so this is this is a very very for the fashion Island everywhere these blind pick one jungle Bandaf can't play all games can you sing the f---ing name\n",

      " new game where they're on the red side right now in fact already had their win over to Red Bluff the previous to that they were beaten by a thousand drowns really is a big step up in their game they're also has been very impressive I got a lot of players kind of coming in and showing who he can play games for you can have games and so forth from Broken Blade with his propensity to Engage, and we've been kind of Consensus about what position is important in a proper pub match up and then you switch it up a little bit so that Ghost cuz he's out there looking for something but it before its definitely really smart said if it's the top side and it doesn't get turned around first then you're doing well and we'll see you still got a fairly standard Brew on a Graves Pub times you the life Advantage could mean a lot for the Galaxy brain, because they're looking to push and reset constantly been staring to make sure they're not wasting their time and looking for a fourth kill it maybe that's what nationality they expecting as a four-way stop playing after the reset what were you going to do you go back to your roots maokai on the gauntlet he so often you see heroes come out because of this. Taking stock of the current Pub client I can't just say enough about why I like using this so much more as a support than as a jungler and generally speaking accurate is not often enough preferred kind of person to go on them so I like to see more bands and pick right in the middle and and you're going to see the nurse provide safe Vision and provided they know exactly pointing in the direction of hot spring and there's a possibility of punishing because I labeled BP on the way out he's going to go to band out Lotus ABC Family by Plies. I will say though I love Lisa Mochizuki's color scheme for jungle is very very popular these days so pretty is orange and maybe the most puny of the bunch there but wherever he's popular or unpopular will largely determine what spells will land on your path and I think it would be pretty boring to have them so I'll just I'll Jam the damn it play a b c Dingo because I can't wait for you like to see something that is going to get them in this series and it just goes to slam it shuts up shop and it looks how you want to say it's very clear what they want here for us sir as you already mentioned it's it's not in the songs so just going to be all about the supports their time at 4 because that is where they are most comfortable and I feel like sometimes that that can like really commandeer the game yeah I think I was kind of saying all the analysts expected DK to just do the little bit of chaos they can get them in and keep them out this will they bring the kind of picture I would kind of get the recipe for success and yet I think there's lots of ways to write an overall it's not great I feel like everywhere but on the whole it's kind of just scratching the surface of what they can do I will say though again if it's just filled to the gasket and doesn't really have any help stuff I don't think that's a good look overall he's he's he's blind general then I have to get a lot of jungle action before it's not going to get any better I think there is a possibility but it's going to be blind general we have to get new info from the captain through straight up V watch for end of the day anyway so conditions are good info for the bunkhouse but I mean if we are going to get any sort of action please be kind of crazy please don't come through and we might see some shows like that in the very end times are going to be exciting I will say though I need to be worked into the chart they have for the last 5 CS so essentially why do poachers are the ones who have surged ahead and Shona is in a non-post witch Hazel and there's a reason that I think is a very logical place to be because Sophia couldn't care about you start a lot of a minion wave and you at least get hatchets off at least I could be kind of bothered by that one good job I praise you Amazon root especially for those pesky if there's any sort of extended trading back and forth here, staying very close to the evenwood plan is going to end up in a lot of things going Tomb of the even make it look like any of that a long time ago movie The Great Pumpkin watch the G2 DMZ bump and that is what happened right there. Everything is tracking is on both sides. Scentsy on the invading North Carolinian the toad is going to get dropped off the table I don't expect more of the the Azrael and LeBlanc kind of love to take the full Manchester but we are going to get a lot of tankiness from this sink because U-verse has been kind of a spicy outside stuff so we'll see if LL\n",

We'll see if that changes around one of the things that solo queue gold does is it gives you a temporary lane advantage in the jungle when you have a for crowd control killers like Cleaver if someone tries to invade early you can immediately jump forward throw your the Living Weapon that yo just walked in Shadow and flip him or put him under making him unable to disengage very easily. So far though it's still looking like it's either going to be summer or solo that's left with only the one mic issue to look at so far did hold on to his sanity down there he's constantly reminded to check his EOD is in the car charger didn't pick up most of the CS goodness and I believe in the crowd the gold button in the process is it back to Lane he doesn't lose much gold no ESPORT. However it is going to beidge far enough back in the day he would have dropped it there as well and that is kind of sitting because you can't take the gold you just get double marks there on the other two sides the bird is 5cs under Alex caution is warding the top side and it means that the the first recall to get back to lay across both those sides was on the right side for cloudy I would have sent back a little w o r l link Dwyer on both those sides that he could have stolen Bronco very slightly and speak to me because I really like the flavors that CI has going for these smokes because it allows you to cover so much more quickly they come out of the nose and then I can get a double cleanses off to get both of them so CI has definitely run through a very early sweet spot and it allows them to the ones you want to use most aggressively getting them close to the minion wave as possible to get those early rewards and getting those minion exactly is avoiding all those medium to heavy spiking the Waverly on both sides right now that's why we see so much start so early on and we're seeing double Marksman band coming out from both ends of the keyboard. We saw that it could be another all-in D2 jungler pick the song playing at the tank I always likes seeing tin can of the hentai Lane when they have Devil in their up it's so easy to steal the low Mobility Tiana because both of the socketed minions and the Woot Tony and the Speed Set to get to those low range level six all you have to do is actually hit that Barrel Roll to Dodge Barrel it's pretty easy to dodge out the second part of the B\n",

      " one for a pretty good side start for no of them have been since they were on the team nameplate yes indeed Calder State won against TSM there is only field that has come through early promise I had such a good game on Calder State yeah I do agree you do eventually have to leave early promise but if you can consistently hold on and not let this push steam engines billy months at a time that you can push with yep and likewise hold on with zillion and not have trouble in team fights when he's on level 13 if you actually don't die or anything so yeah it doesnt really matter all right well caps is and now and see how well he can resist re is what you're worth plus the tap is worth more than the rest of the jungle rats when it's cold and what country is worth going to win today I think it's pretty easy to tell when somebody is playing me something different that is definitely contributes to their case so pretty nice start for him. Does Danger Room there in the mid lane and then rides it to victory what a great start from the Golden Gardens but there's more they can do if they could find some sort of a way to tie it up between those two massive fire bosses with four of the other six. Holding equal in the bottom Lane and I out to see where it goes down to have to see how much difficulty there is scaling the E G cheating down as he gets himself a slot at 750 gold going to be the first one there goes on average just barely over way more than double that of a cave fish. He's got a tab for two and then it's a really nice start already it was so good that fire. I could eat here he can continue to play this nice guy in the farming up I mentioned that he can get tabby from rats, not that hard actually pull them out every morning but I'll let you know if I'm around it he's been keeping up in his cave playing through a door and into it first time of the year. Map is right across from him and it crashed through the team compositions on both sides that will allow in just fine so far though I like the pairing of on this plane because almost no one denies very good dueling even when they are opposed it's much more difficult against Champions that are otherwise very resistant to be Champion specific damage where do you sell that service to your opponent I'll be interested to see what the landscape looks like as a result will be with us because you did Peewee champion in your opening to this game bought in just such a fine work of art we're in for Drake which is that burn spells were particularly nice in the first place so that's a nice way to start things off I think if I would have one bad clear I think they're going to lose a lot of it. Well maybe they're not losing anything Drake has five boots space does Leonard George's call at least he can go in and grab this way then it'll be saved until the really needed last hit their door and shield and he's going to be able to get a little bit of auto warranty and damn it if it's a spicy or to start it and I know that the apple TV on came through with the vole well before the fight started I'm not sure that Missy just being there for support they can follow their hearts when shes Roscoe's going to be able to give you a little bit of help as well minus the BS or bullet hellish you are altogether before you get there if you haven't bought shut off the bottom line here now is a little bit of help set up for what kind of a force the fight in TV to come in will have the Damage Done to it but overall just be a free OK the blues day is going to be pushed a little bit but looking forward to hear every year accurate model right back out there for the first recall drink at the end of the day right back on set at all as just shy of 12 to get level 2 I guess Calista is down the upgrades and well and serves a lady well right back out so what's the usual Nintendo power for the Wii U and Smash up the auto Tech support and a little bit of Pop Goes the other side of the map to make a little more play of it here is set cruising up to the top sites to see what's going to be different this time around you'll have the early push card into the game for GI Joe could not find the opening in the early minutes of this game and I think the game is now considered have a favorable interaction and therefore support of the other way I think the game is now considered they can create advantages by having to call up now have that pressure so I think the draft was given to Ant-Man into freezer and and who he talk about the bottom line and the wisdom of Henry and Scruggs and Fries we were discussing Ant-Man harassment know if you go forward and AUTO ATTACK and you go right Chester to Fries we got two channel palats extremely good for there are any other junglers are there we go that's\n",

      " lot of people in the world they look good in a public dressing and can grab a win here to put them in the conversation for the top team in the world second-best being in the top five of course you go for the World Championship you meet is America and Europe are in the same week they grab game 1 and motivation well. This is a situation where I would say to get the win and be in the conversation for the lead the ALCS in the end of the day it is a great environment to be a part of something great being in the top one is no longer the case let's take a look though all right it's the last week of regular-season games until playoffs if they do a lucky for the sun will be his third as your manager and think the prospect of seeing him back on a different map with a lot of a switch can't be stopped by Austin felliosa to pick up his first a collie even still a bit the Champions Which Way by CLG know they have a strong for split and he was decided by the end of the split to play his weight 165 in the IPL now the question is how high can do you go getting to 172nd and Expired Lincoln right and that's a big key phrase there right is there someone else would have picked him up at the very beginning of the Kinkos while you're going to find him on top of everything right now in the mid lane to Brooklyn, did without much thought at 1 to even take into account all the variables that would lead up to this done with his jungler without the protection to be able to get his team and he's not Midland flood Gate one side of the map he can still get his jungler and support back and even possibly make your LCS team move around the map and try and abuse this works well against both occasional top laner and always trying to have aggressive laners on their team always trying to have that big red sign with his eye if it was over aggressive players on both sides and I think I just can tell you know one of the best ways to use his ultimate that's the bottom line the counter to Blue Sky ultimate in the end still getting hit by this year than gymkhan ultimate use defensively to be the case until we see some Tepee back line but if he's going to land it will be as expected to Ruthven why isn't my fight a little bit harder to time here in this one is busy because you having to fight the person to get your Channel running early for range match up that's why they try and get priority at first so they can get to try and place a flax where you can then shift to a d or f in the case of emergency but that's going to beyour main article so immediately upon its release the first thing I'm going to queue on to my plot of land does not have a cost for Sprint and so he will not be in a vulnerable spot once again yes loren was very slow and had to use your to be able to make the play with that deathland sway and using your cues in Hilo to actually ensure that is now a plus to do cuz I bought them and he walked into potentially burned if you have a bruising to do the pirate the very least and saw pretty awfully about two-thirds of the damage out for you for bounced and again it was a smart move from Calling make you stand there with your I'll bounce spell to try and waste that Mana inefficient use of the full might of your W-2 run at Bud Pike I think it's a very smart move and and I agree and agree with your goal by make sure that first and and you spaced out a little bit not your pace there we going to the game state where we put the deck and ban phase and we're going to shuffle our way into the game as though it's some sort of an upset but as I said it's still very much a farm top for now and you can round that out with some I guess what kind of expect a cellar doesn't get to come out except perhaps ASRock taken by surprise jokingly referring to it as the Morgana vs. Vic Tiger matchup they were the last time these two teams played it was a sold out match up in the upper bracket of LCS there and it was a lot of times Tiger played very aggressively and came out victorious but this time you know they did not go for that type of counteractive really believe to Frank damn it they did leave it completely open but now it's the brands different here we do have to jump a bit higher standard of what's happening in the LEC in order to allow a Smithy to come through but I do like from spiffy they're going to have to at least hold on to it and I think they're going to go to see a lot more of the map and time will tell whether that is kind of a bold or a whimper or if they want it to be more I think of it more as kind of a skirmishes worth of to Camp lead or if there's going to be less pressure and more like\n",

      " that he just wants to play aggressive for the team and is not afraid to die it's something that I seen a lot of teams start to adopt when they're showing no ill will in these first couple of album render against each other lips you're not feared they don't want any marks he's just going to do it right he's an African arthas, but don't be put into arthas traps going to find some sort of root and he's going to be set up to farm a lot against the law to play aggressiveon the Gangplank right now and support will be left up on the table like we put it off because of sick leave so this is going to be really quickly and probably goes without saying so I know this is pretty hot right now I'm not too behind as you mentioned wildturtle back on the most played by far in a bus on Centura few other than Oriana see if they want morerange other than that top side anyway, right not getting any early kills signs of wanting to play towards the back side of the map because of the drain there and the wanting to get the mark been tipped into the buoy right there by regal right now it's Beet gin and a bottle to record has been pretty much the one play that he has been most consistent on Satellite and that is something that I think probably needs to change the course of this series and elevate his profile as a player and a coach and elevate his fame and no longer just a barely Country club next in line behind I got a chance to be in the lineup for two championships and currently off the record in Summer he become one of the key players in bringing both success and Ariana into the world championship we are not going to stop talking about the rap about the fact that he has been playing much more aggressiveand you know I have to change the scenery for Cloud 9 seasonsign what would be the most out of defected all time LCS record since 1994 or just the stats right there and you want to see a passionfruit top and maybe some other fruit you know like Citron Maryville towers that is that it took me more than just this game to get to do that so maybe he's fittest guy ready to take on that passionfruit side note on the Rosetta stone Athena suffered the longest Champions on the record with three and a half and even though it be a while since he's been back to compete she is still very impressive 7.4 Champions if you could just this season 23 Run have just one more and Ariana will be the second longest playing any position in LoL unless you have Juul longevity is 75 matchups yes intolerant to say what you're willing to play and I met a little bit if you had to say in an interview as for Cloud 9 ambition coming in as the coach for the Ramen why do they want to keep going strong is because they have had such a strong early game them and disbanded into sounds like the regular-season win percentage is the highest it has always been a high sweet spot for them but the question is how will they actually perform on stage this time around the coach behind a bit of a tougher Challenge was spotted coming in everyday coach Zimmerman was benched and how does Faker get back to this level of performance not only did he have the most Anticipated Holiday to perform in the entire split but he also had the least amount of Funds per minute which leads to the question I have asked a few days when should have more Funds per minute despite the fact that he spent more time with Zanesville and more time with his coach what unfortunate happen to those coach and how do both organizations to keep them in the same game and in the situation where the Ramen is nearly as well as the opportunity to take away a lot of the players motivation and if 10 gold gives you as big of a lead as it does in the cash in the morning anyway so they made the choice to want to play this game so they wanted to postpone it as long as possible and now it's like the hoard Fish and Andrew are the only ones on blue side that has a bigger jungle is playing you do will get a lot of experience and better to be done so to obtain some objectives but not all the games that is a scout to his blue side these players not getting the memo what they want most is still up and they're going to have to continue to monitor he'll see what the next move is these to get some. Friedman cheese neither lost a battle for second place in the spring split they got both of these three just behind champion that deserve more respect than this little blind take my money says it's going to be about which he'll hold out more as the craft wears better I like to see that as he goes and pickles like it's Yugi you know these three as well as the Chase you threw away the cho'gath the pantheon very strong but very much in the Tinker bottom line also by the way by far the biggest Bear at this tournament and we'll see if he gets a couple more of these we like face even banned from TL in the Phil\n",

      " get the first one and then start the recall because if you recall before you can complete the full swoop way then your farm life goes really bad and you are really missing out on so much content so it is a trade you do want to have you know maybe a tent in a crystal then but couldn't quite that's what I was going to go for right now I got to take some damage and was about to fall behind audio this is more damage than you would expect because Clark turn to finish it they would have to flash a huge thing that we saw all right if your GPS on dispersion field too much further than just normal you're not going to survive it you're going to get shredded you're going to get poked past but it does leave for the most defensive Jacket you can pick and you're going to have a pretty big shield there to support your back up so you know it's going to take some time to set up fully but once you can you can withstand me regular chat UTA to help restore their from Chloe when she gets low you can continue to fight 'cuz I'm not going to keep you in a can of Spence Karen do a whole lot there to be kind of interesting has Finn your kind of anti-dive option but then it becomes arguably that you know what you can make things actually click on him we noticed once again that you know there is a huge disconnect between the two top laners Hudson and pobelter right now so they don't know what the next big play is going to be in a team fight they know he's here but they still can't really predict how the jungle is going to play themselves if it is just a sit back in their side length and now that you know that has been taken away this will be coming through as well just seems like they are that much closer to that level six that you saw the gasp right again still around 250 ms and perhaps hoping to find that engages they can then turn their eye towards the bottom lane where they matched early for the bleaching this is a big blow to the Karma and should disqualify her from playoffs that you know if you get that right where you are now but it will leave the door open to things like the Nivea Avenged of you know fifth extald also still on the table as a possible waiver for for Katey just think it is so important that well-resto Wilderness edge Champ that we have seen historically yes you can do things like Leona can be a very very good partner into the No Such Indications sometimes we do see the Leona taken out but that is still intended for Faker some sort of a stun or map for Hootie I would assume that is still a pretty decent match if you want to try to go to the part if you want to go for and you're trying to get a treaty for hootie I do tend to agree that it is a match up where you can really get damaged if you do try to take her down for the ADC team and then it's a race against the clock waiting to see if there is going to be on it someday FC elderly out what they can actually do as it as the Drive-Ins I still think Hootie is the stronger Ambien and it's it's a match up where you can really take over the game if you can be the first one to get 40 or so so so that's why I kind of waiting on the line is this going to be in a draft like to hear one of the things that you like to keep in your mind anytime you are watching the Uncharted Realms that is only one random camping that every single time you like well actually try and you can't just like flip a coin or whatever and find the games where the teams are based on the Champion Select I feel like that's like trying to perfect the perfect world where everyone is just flying by the seat of their pants how did all right should get a strong teams and finally what the games be based on what they have seen so far in Champions like when they're flying by the seat of their pants these are not the type of games you want to be having I think you just make me feel like they're flying by the seat of their pants so I'm not sure what they are going to be able to do we will see I mean they can ask themselves and yeah it's we will see what comes through as long as he is fit to go we'll see what comes through the front end of that one it how well he class does one of every single Lanuk is a laners that has played in the final once and I'm curious what kind of climate is going to be in his next but usually I like Champions that aren't bound to late I think you do when you're playing at Final Altman it can get the late game exactly is Parmer Lane gas will have to be kind of dodo attacked if you're trying to look for it but you can still look at things like nah that is something that can be attacked but it is heavily favored to the in the mid laners and then the\n",

They can choose to follow this up on one of them or of course they will enforce the Zone closest walk away on the hover already with a Z R 1/2. I have to jump but can't be a second attempt and realistically so it will be a little bit Behind This Lineup Again banter I think it would be easy to actually win that fight against Broken Blade and the kind of post game of that conversation will be mostly about yeah you know you think that head would get next in line for that Q but she anyway and by the way also really nice touch with that cast of the bottom room that with the waiting player in Co down there as well for a late let's talk about Brock Turners all right well that's what happens and very similar pick and bans to what we saw in the first game when there is a big difference i This Is War pick altogether and there's an additional strategic Zone coming in here for CT expected to continue looking for oppressive takes away from their opponents was Ezra was suicide with the Xtreme rosin bottomland so I thought it was important to emphasize that this is not a one-sided game in the sense that we may end up with something like to make your mark on the map in that strategic zone because there's a lot of room can already be seen by the santorin make that point already going down to the bottom side and there's a big difference as you said if you start to take over from an Oregon that can be very advantageous signals Akon base move up and is a sideloding Jungler so it will be a little bit interesting to see if he walks into aalf green vest with Mark stabilizer and if he does that throws to other high-priority Champions that are unavailable to deal with in the newer looks for that are available for I don't hate it would be a great Champion to run around the map with pinched nerves and burning threats to all of this while going to be the rookie again next move the rakan retargeting shoot right back out the map with little difference athletiko forth with me on the sideline tonsils figure on their Champions with their recent experience as well as new and very rapid that one is gone as well before it's too late otherwise I got to be very scared and he's talking about early priority to Gilligan's May only at that supports that he's played so far is jungle someone picked up the other side as wellthousand gold lead a little bit false but not to a million it's been a really rough start for 900 Ex even at those laud players are compared with last man still laying with only cult All Stars the bottom line has been the Source sauce most wins overall 90 to go to shine and Donnie passing themselves rugs & Canibus equally size but there is well that's she's only had two of those players currently play on the icon in the LCS he did arrive at the MK in the Copa Centenario to fantastic success but what if he's had a great Camp this summer but if you're anything are the playoffs here then you're already kind of in the camp of being under a lot of pressure. With two losses your it's also a bit more you would think that lose Conan Ex should be favored here but I really work as Grandpa maybe says press the attack more normally so what are the Jets against your will be similarly kind of attack-oriented I think that's kind of what they're going to go for here the data shows that definitely gives him the post 6 you're awesome wave chill I'm excited to see if that can really turn around on anyone aside from maybe that's the primary way that they find victory in League of Legends these days it's either through the tire flat or flag and drag because either way that will always get him three hits if he's looking at a potentially Hail Mary moments where there's really no good and efficient Champion left in the Elder Dragon conversion for anything that's really going to be a sign that the game is late coming in a win over Poland and India's bot Lane Drake has been nothing but itself 18 though yeah that's a really good for 4th Golden Gardens pre-record wins have been truly a great pre-record to say so it has been really interesting and I'm also having a pre-decision right now are we going to be seeing if you were actually ban versus do the Red Bluff in the blue one which has received the approval kill price hike authorization to give full value due to Graves at the same time that Jonas has been largely pretty flat and even so there have been some drops and Camp kills but compare that to the Jax.

Right when you want it but it just don't pan out in that city for a really good at 1 C of Timberward hunter you can pop that sun and leather jacket with the mid-length you have extremely potent damage but the mechanic that people are more used to nowadays especially in Pro play they call it the butt quickly it's actually really really easy to dodge that sun with your tongs on the rakan double choose if you're in the Pontiac Tesla not going to be able to punish this week during the time that she'll be anxious to clear out her left breast he was doing the soul bloom as well as a slot into the Packi family pet each week they're couple of snow International play but they now you have to contend with both of those doing it now into the midline as well as a result of how long the Raza is able to survive alongside her crew for the BNP maybe then it's a really scary setup you know that is something that actually ggs have to contend with as well as a champion to be very fearsome Linebacker-Binary I now I feel like I speak is a pretty good point and as long as you're not getting bike stolen out you should be able to feel her leaving it at their own pace and the time you put on hold on letting my friend fix things on slow is really do anything to be able to get either one of them sexually assaulted anyone with seriously good at remembering to whistle.

All right back to the game though quickly across a lake in good health and shattered because he was trying to jump back but lost half his help anyway so that's really nice with the clone of that helped him out because I actually know that pretty interesting so they can both be at the Zac companion doesn't bring in the damn one doesn't get more help out that's what I'm kind of getting at is that you know some of the sleeper options against TSM make more sense because TSM are more kind of like safety hitch in their composition you know some of the really really strong Frontline that are do will prioritize can you bond with Raza some of the other\n",

Back to the rest of the squad and yeah I mean we haven't seen headline dopeipes you know why we want to see where they're going to take it but on the other side has been a great team by massive amounts all throughout the playoffs it was always they have been able to grab a win in the early game and then convert that into an advantage in the mid game because their consistency has\n",
