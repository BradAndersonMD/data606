pretend place but we thought they were upgraded there as well and 0 through is somewhat of a shock to us to see how it goes very tough road to get here they played are the three best teams in N A Garten Play 3 the week or once and still can pick up wins and they're hoping I can get a lil bit better I did talk with him and management yesterday though and when it was pointed out was it in gets tight until this game their first three were all the stuff you know that's at least deposited are going to pick Blue Sky for themselves if you get a chance to do better this time around they are get unemployment even so I can feel like a return if he's around yeah definitely the case in for Golden Guardians you really are looking to grab a win here today because they have I believe TL coming up very soon I can get them as well so they have some very very tough opponents coming out in the next week or two also it really does not get any easier for them and everything's well they have had their Fridley the toughest part of their schedule already is past they lost all threegames and it's more about the way in which they lost right it is about the fact that neither of those easily none of those games look really close they were pretty handily beat me in all three I know a lot of people I do have some concerns about that because you could look at it and think okay well if they were tightly contested give their clothes games then steal this could be the fourth best teams league and maybe it is what it is we're difference between the top three in the back if you will come through as his game is underway or not being picked up or down the golden Guardians and I feel like I can be going to someday who he has not been having a very good what he's been so Love Field to get I believe the worst gold difference at 10 of all mid laners in the LCS right now so getting the Carrie feels like the wrong choice. And having a good time that I have a bear I mean no he hasn't plane carries he has been getting jumbled attention and he has been you know what losing these games as well it ishas not been someday you know Sterling valiantly in the lost its breath the team kind of falling behind most of the map has really been collapsing in the first two games you could look at bang it's okay will he still has strong performances directions Maps kind of fell apart but then yesterday against liquid they did get decimated in the bot Lane and you know someday at least on the York has something happening but that never really got going as can be expected when the rest of my life is losing all right well and is going to have Camille here in the jungle and he hasn't even wanted it brighter spots I would say front of these devices Bureau in 3 start the leads he led the league in Gold difference in spite this year when to run go to bed at 10 for junglers Kalisto and I have still been pretty strong and Camille certainly a great really game fighting jungler can take some things over when you got a chance in one of the two so lame that certainly one you want to get ahead and its many games would be the same here for Sunday if that akali is going to the topit's a bit like the flexibility there Alessandra can be Flex Tonneau to match up wherever they do want to go. I just can't commit or tossed Oak and lysandra are we are expecting to be after chocolate Sondra with a lot of people are pretty comfortable in that matchup against the akali down that akali did not have the ability to get into a shroud and and have that safety there that would look really good turtley a strong powerful Champion lissandra the most pick mid laner of 9.2 to the second round of bandanas billion drop away actually ended up for a little bit there to be picked up as well so like a more supportive billion but right now hovering on towards that rise which again we can still see Rise Play the Top Line as well but we did see who replayed call you recently that we are going to see bang a locking in this from prefer milk come from is DiwaliI will see if that is going to 5th and final pay for they do still have the ability to flex a collie top or mid and counter pick as they so choose golden Guardians going to eat rounding out there's wrap here with what we assume will be the bottom Lane Super Bowl winners are they know from the very beginning that sir. Lysandra and they chose to tell kids have a jongleur now will wait for the last so low that like the draft but they can defend their findings to the compass going to line up well we're going to go for a sport late-game Insurance you're on the basement and I do for actually like deathly most on mid to late is dire for example is very good all throughout last year but Champions like as real and as I stay here I think this is his best fight style and I think is best for him as a player, some top that footing Sirocco on side or Lane only quite good at Sammy's more Meiji supports that has another thraka here as well and they're going to haveprice of quite a bit heavy tr400s asriel is going to be the physical damage their Camille is also but no more more people are going towards these more AP heavy styles build for a real self know we may see people picking up some more magic resistance to help deal with that of this rocket certainly will help out quite a lot of them lays a lot of players are in about a high-level actually skipping was going to kill until quite far into the game at some point and sometimes going into two points you to point D before even picking up the W at sometimes level five or even later so you can play this fairly of rectal you can play a fairly Lane dominant Style with a suraka with a couple points in a few and eat and we'll see if that's what they're going to look for because Brom is certainly a divorce Champion that you can really get a bit of aggressive on it and if there's a really kind of bully around in this Lane that's Rocka by microinteractions but I'm going to ask you a question you can past Camille ultimate while you're still dance with hook shot rightglamper you can cast it mid travel I believe so yeah okay because either way I want to be able to send them down and now you can't do the show up unless you cast it from out of the rain so there's a nice my friend raccoons where you got kind of a telegraph pole that you can stop early on so I'll be watching for that with all the way here on this one is actually time you're down field on a rise ultimate I think I found a can be quite powerful the akali if you can actually have enough lock down there you have left on your own if you can overlap your silence out of that so there is certainly the ability to do that against really any Champion how you can layer those species there and if all that up for the fear from Nocturne excetera excetera so there is a lot of ability to layer that crowd control from Golden Guardians won't see if they will be able to do it that's all we are on everybody has the first game of the day is herenot having this darts they wanted and honestly a surprise to many fans at home as well we'll be back on the right sofa to show up a bit better than he has so far this year and Golden Gardens hoping to turn things around the previous to get themselves yeah we are going to get Aftershock rise your little something that school is may get a new face has done right away. Left. Need to heal their yeah it's not required from Honda and that will make him and definitely have to play a little bit more safe we do students killed barrier in the bottom Lane so very are being taken here almost a Rocka that combination especially you with his head if they have Gear with the 80 also bring you'll really does make us talk a lot tougher to Target in DC fights and that's something you're going to have to keep in mind this is also, it is not area so this is even more Lane Focus along the style of bill that I was talking about I'm very much expecting a couple points in queue a couple points in ddr4 Olay because if you want to go the more defensive style area is going to give you the shield on the heel this is purely for the office with the comment your cue does hit confirm your comment with the flow on it so they really are looking to win Lane and starting down one stunner is it's going to hurt that a little bit it's going to be scary to watch for but we'll see contacts me to grab this red buff invade not looking pretty OK or this is pretty obvious that sponsor was Li Shang they know where the ergot came from kind of Dodge the war of the way out so we'll see if and as for my distance and goes in a vertical junglee actually looking like he's heading straight to the threat so he's actually just trying to go right to Red then Retreat back to the top quadrant for a Scuttle in a blue and and now they know and yeah they do know now but can they really do anything about it that's going to be a question they both still have it available and I think you do with the rides being pushed into a dangerous for and is dry out of froggen that is still worthwhile I will you take a flask decent trade here and then opposed to war. If I can take some slow way back too late I thought he should expect it to be coming from that side of the map and really foggy should not had to have had to give up a slash yeah he wasn't that side you just was so afraid of being used to fight for this buff and Anna getting Boscov's actually is level 3 over contracts you tried to grab so many of these camps in and keep them for being denied that he is getting tonight anyway plus the gate coming through successfully so despite this deal to better to start trying to deep time around the map because I'm texting from red to Red Cross map during that time you know honest farming more pants so he is going to be in that regard I got a flash down or for the kill down a level one as well as the flashlight on. Lane so has already gotten a couple Summers for himself to be taking the wrong way here and I'm feeling quite good about where they are sitting right now in the despite a nice dark contract that we have the early game lead for and in the jungle and this has been a common trend for him so far this split he is a player that I want to give a lot of eyeballs tour throughout this split is 100 thieves not looking great individually he is standing out and we'll see if it going to season around how big of the parts he's going to be in it over although it's his game is still fairly close Sunday are doing quite well so far in the Top Lane against Hunters been one of these stronger players on Golden Guardian Sunday 7 everyone is waiting to see him come back on line back to the most MVP for him that he was last year and I call you can certainly take over definitely feeling good on this case it with the Soraka support you should be winning Lane and indeed they are feeling good so far against big enough for me and you know it is worth noting that someday becoming fairly, but this is no he's going to leave for work and then he's going ravenous Hunter and taste your blood secondary you start the door and she'll just doesn't make you very very cranky and hard to put Shadow Lane so despite the range disadvantage in those early levels and credible amount that it becomes very difficult for her. To shove you out I got to follow up on Soraka no pointed heel just yet for a late so level for two points to me as expect ya DMX Rock has been middle of last year of what are phrases like me a lot with Matt for Guardian support innocently enough and you can go to Camp Dodge least you got a lot of damage out that way the 44th the TV out of pain but if we're supposed to post here recall so he's actually find doing this it just acting up here for now we're going to have definitely coming back to base before too terribly long Ortiz rocket has and going to get more gold generation we look for the rest of our lanes in front of course have to play a bit up in his magic to do anything at all and it still supposed to get a check that size garage door will stay alive still has that level lead so it's going to be three straight scuttles for him and it feels very good about that is that you know he is getting a fairly significant damage and going to have the experience to lead as a result it will really can be a very powerful of his game right now at 3 to level five glows sure but there's no Camp to take right now he's sitting there 3.0 who cares what decimal is because there's nothing to grab unless he can get up to these frogs and right now just sitting around being a at 6 minutes level 3 Nocturne still 3 to go for the crugs because aatrox is under threat you know they saw that somebody could be keeping back and rectum beating on if they don't see this coming in but it probably is heading down this way Fernandez here instead of the contract is still on the back and take it away and us with these are absolute slaughtering this jungle matchup now it's like in the Midland so I can withstand it for the Easley and fights for the war if I lose a lot of help in doing self how to contract finally will get level 4 Office Camp but it's another to cast going to retreat back up to his Red Bluff as well as those crowds in and we'll see if contractor is going to be able to find a way in when you're getting such a delayed level sick to just make your birth alternate that much more important you have to have that impacts because you really are falling I friendly far behind well-described Camp should be 5 for contract to go to respond worth quite a bit but he's still got a ways to go to zanda 6 off of this time is now it goes I think it would be enough XP and he's going to be well ahead of the global average year by over 30 seconds and level 647 715 for him it was a really nice job honestly if tracking contract anticipating where he's going to be in after moving in for some for of war and trying to make sure that they have eyes on contract and denying as much as I possibly can from him the bottom side of the always pushing boss right now so worried about a half remove us a good slow to buy a bit of space will he go for the Q flash or you just like boys like you. And now I had to take a bit of damage and this will be a non-gay and they really are getting a lot out of this so far up a good fifteen CS already is going to be quite by Nice & L o v even skipping the Gill still so this is going to be at least two level seven before we do see that coming through so this it really is you know fully Pope heavy to Rocca has already run 427 gold from the support questo I could be stacking that up quite quickly and really having a strong impact on the map
