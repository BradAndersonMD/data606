stop and then everyone else fighting for 2nd 3rd is really quite different now and JT wants to make a statement that they are the best team in the fruit and honestly it's been a good start for us friends having a top speed out of groups can often be in a pretty easy matchup when you make red semi finals be a first for an LMS Squad will see if I can continue on if there's a lot to play you me and off the bat no surprises there Pantheon of the first prom dress by also no shock I'm trying to figure out what gametes words with ring to the world State we ended up seeing what ended up not working in their first game where it felt like a bunch of Assassins and then were unable to set up any type of fight and I wonder what type of mix up or going to try and bring today because they did a lot of different stuff in the regular season for the game and find snowball wins competition on the International Spacehe wasn't able to have that early game snowball performance still a lot of fans were expecting out of him coming right at ya and I thank you for looking across the rift on today team they might end up trying to play this game much like they would have played a game in the LMS where they just try and extend the laning phase Farm up and then win because they are better and just kind of plate defense against Camis work because I don't think any pork has that much practice that are very good at playing skin look out for here and specifically looking at today seems a lot of good options for them through the draft is there you go that's going to be a strong Flex pecs Alton for food for 4 or Little V but I always have my eyes on him when it is a strong performing super super Wellness Holly in that upset win over f g xin the Rockler with arrows pointing GIF moving for a top player in the mid they making way for zingano support and so you have to expect that he faces themselves be going to be easier yeah and Lil D who had such a good game one up against fpx is now considering the solution vs. KY to match of now I want to talk a little bit because coming to the tournament I was expecting a lot more Lucian stole what I feel like it happened in a few of these grasses p.m. to pick solution with the expectation that can go anywhere but ended up putting where I don't actually feel like you can do that much against Because I Said So in this instance I'm hoping for play solution but we have to see the rest of the draft and it's possible if we see something like a fresh come down into the bottom line around the worldplus interest be super strong to resist even the bottom line because Joanne 1cc that's going to be instant kill once you hit Level 6 on the Sandra so me personally whenever I see those two Champions walked in I want that to be the following options are for Katie I will see you will come through with that one it will be an exciting to want you to wash walls you already know it's a big Tyson Nautilus the bottom side for dominated one that last picture around out this phase money is available here in a collie is the current however and that's going to be locked in her here we know that can be flexible and see where is it going what I like your style and they have more scaling options in the Kaiser they have some engage tools as well with his Nautilus and they're trying to hold on to that don't go pick up a little bit later we song on the closet I actually wouldn't be that surprised to see him hold out even longer especially with some of these really strong toppling Dan being taken off the tablefeels like to have a option did you know exactly the most pick Champion of the World by the overall pick rate of a Collie was only 39% for all of world so it's definitely picking up in priority as we get more and more of these really quality Soul enters picking her up over there looking at Lucian or syndra most likely your proposal I can still see things like a Lucian top Woodson for the bot Lane so theoretically could be anything but gragas off the table jazz on the table here as well and again even on both sides I want to looking at now for Levi in the side of Kansas to secure a very strong Pop please don't go to put a lot of Harry power in both zeros and Levi on the table by the map which isn't all that difficult but it's because we've I love to play for the top fivedive Towers biggest play around a Renekton reckon we's very strong combination these types of tools will give you the power to find these Burleigh place last I checked Levi actually had the highest damage percentage of drummers in the world championship and the highest yes share of genres of the world championships do if they end up going with something like Nocturne expected very heavy Farm push now the bigger question will be is this like a lease swap level 6 minutes. What are the absolute Premier junglers so far at the world championships has been in about half of all the game of plans included now it's happening here for JT Melbourne right now on the Gangplank it's going to be a couplealongside again thanks to the passive burn and you believe the pope with you it's not like at least 10 play around that Lanes Winsted for Honor this going to be much more focused around Pho pho in the mid lane if it is a send-off before bottling we have a lot more pressure as well as aggressive Esports lineup and Nocturne can go to lead the charge in the rest of the team we are going to see them to Hawaii to attack around that area of the map once the levels come through all we have to do is survive the early Lane in power that.is it the next time it could be up against a tireless ality matchup actually then you call him if he's able to consistently Lander trap on a rope but also could be very volatile early and that's it that's it that's where I go for collect mid we just saw the toynbee game basically the guy who probably invented five mini pro play now we have to do is pick it up very volatile as we set your the problem 4th light in this matchup is that he's not going to have the same sort of the Jungle support especially in the early leveled so I don't like you would see a lot of 3 almonds way to max out you do if your W-2 you're just because you do have to be careful of on his Aleve we've definitely do have power especially around level six. Just sits and starts in one more time right here was hoping to find their first win of the group stage here at Worlds 2019 J team found himself top of the group so faron December 6th we go to close out this group for the day if we're two more games of all this one but we'll see what the records end up being a or some striation here is JT man can face offand looking at this day is a full this was definitely one of them or unknown matchups in terms of who would be the favorite especially because it's hard to kind of figure out how strong the LMS is going to be at the school championship we know the flash wolves was kind of the gold standard for so many years except last year we have flash wolves who narrowly missed getting out of their group and then we had two other on that seems you both 1016 only four teams have gone Owen 16 group stage and two of them last year from the same region and then went flash world doesn't qualify for world because most of their team moved way you almost expected j-team to come in and do the same however I feel like J team was one of those teams who consistently was good in the LMS but could never quite get over the Finish Line to make it to world so in a lot of ways not only can they try and get them X Redemption they can also kind of prove to themselves they can compete in the world level 16Catholic summer split their first went out to eat phenomenal but they have always been denied and has been right there with them guys always been getting high in the midline we both was going to be there and then j-team consistently drop the ball in playoffs now how fo fo get his chance on the international stage is going to be really telling for him who has been trying to prove himself or so so long teleport versus claims in the bottom line as well so he can get some of his health back that will actually end up being Alina dinner's cooking all in threat has been burned by slave without actually burning any summer spells on JT into a lot of times can struggle to get pressure in those early levels I do think you have to spend a lot of Mana if you do you want to push up its way into the cell though is going to let us walk away get the last bit of a flash for it and nothing I suppose rest didn't expect there was two level W right there but really ambitious to try and go into that kill and now without a flash to be very vulnerable now Hannah only level to hear walk away but you have a Q gave it away the location was known that Levi's go to Amazon jungles kills this Ward knows that he's spotted on this one and it said to tell you hi. Going Pops I don't teleport on Daryl's yes he does have W but if pot of water to go for a gank there he could have tried to put zeros in a really difficult but unwilling to risk it though it's really hard for rescue on the GPS actually stepped forward and help him put down dammit but she was there as soon as possible and yes it's over ambitious by rest to bring that flash really but I got enough damage on a zero-turn to teleport and now they've killed him without him being able to recall to catch this wave I also think there was so much room do for a fact he knew Hannah like very likely be on that table saw a huge way of pushing in so now so much you're saying in the draft if you probably wouldn't have that window but with only showing on the top side could be us but once he's got to turn tail and run does it. And he pays for gastritis or Coke comes through not losing more than one seminar but both will bring both couch and rubber now that phone bill has lost his flash around the time that he and Levi in the next couple minutes are going to be taking over 260 have to keep in mind to continue kill Brett around that midline on illusion with no summer self they're locked in that hook that was actually going to be hot if it did go through feels like both of these teams came out of the gate strong big punches the amount of early summer spell usage is much higher than you seen so far at the world championship we've seen every game today come down to a Barren play or some late-game decision and this game with the early summer spell usage kind of had the potential to do that in such a way but because Kia had the name and rest and thought I had the toppling we are still at even both not a squad that plays Super Active in the early game trying to kill you Hannah actually one of those the lowest jungle proxy needs in the LMS entirely his Lanes just dominated they were up over 10 CFM basically every single match up drop the regular season and even the other day against 1 + Phoenix this squad 1 through team fighting it wasn't through Superior early-game it came down to four major team fights around objective where little B and focal play their opponents so if they are on even footing dating have a lot of good things to look forward to later in the game right now to Webster game though I mentioned it looking good in the late game sitting around maybe not the worst thing in the world looking out the bottom side small CS difference and you did it again I think Levi will hit Level 6 off of drugs in the Top Lane since he was able to catch actually a lot of experience and CS when's aerosky to that gank so we'll see how sweet ride guesstimating his music has the highest XP camp in the game he doesn't know for sure that he showed but he's getting pinged so yeah they know for the fear which is absolutely telegraph's we can find that perfectly and this was erected
