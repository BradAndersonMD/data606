what's pectin Canada for Viper and that Camille split just yesterday or I should say on Saturday was the rut that is yesterday it was breach this week have just been on fire even in the first game they played where they lost it off of Baron into recalling in the nevermind. Phoenix is the are the famous Phoenix is Here Is Gone the infamous Twisted Fate going to be left up most likely Lily off the table Ford Artic he is going to play as you brought out and Lilia play it against the clouds look pretty good on it I want to see if those situations arise get again cuz he had a pretty good start will see if you was able to close the rest of that one out now looking at the battle is the rest of the band come throughtruconnex what happened and then oh wait CSM golden Guardian on Saturday or Sunday as their first-round opponent once that comes through Chase off the table good early dominant Champions mcoc top let's see what else they want to protect honestly I love you're looking at CLT over at Big you're probably the most worried about the bottom line for sure. Finaf remove event the standout performer for this team Falls with long but also dark so early on should be a thing you see the Early Middle a band from CLG but you know. Con Graves Star Talk on Fusion Ola for Volver something like that is something I have to keep in mind and didn't ask him again is what also let he will consider the favourite 5 and 7 the record with the door. Phoenix version of this roster CLG for Thrift time they are showing these exact five players on the rip this is the third game on the LCS States Beltre stepped out for two of them for Tuesday he's right back in which I totally agree with the early set pic comes through and frag acidity play that champion last time around they picked it will come true again the highest priority 80 karrie and we'll see if Johnson grass that is his most played Marksman by far to grab that one pic number 8 for Johnson on that yeah and he is just so good that we cannot his as real games hitting pretty much every still shot in these critical teamfight positioning been really good but obviously and I want to see how did play around around the ash rather than having you know the safety of the Ezreal for Johnson there's that Olaf I was talked about for dark. He wants to go in there though it for set up a toys fun having a bastard Wrangler with Hawks. To make it easy and get right back out no problems at all for some laying down as well out of early pressure here I like they're already with beautiful as well to get hot very clearly waiting on support to make sure that later and I'll just be waiting on top link to give Viper carpet and so if you're looking at it now for her for Band-Aids here for Stihl G's probably going to go target support role as the Viper pick up so maybe around as okay as you want to guard against vipers red side last counterpick I don't know if they're worried about anything besides the ribbon that's obviously the big stand out his car was pretty good at going to have to Blind. yeah we can see what's going to come through this one I know he's been a very big proponent of playing Kennen up there and he's not very good cheap flights to the field you have not been really able to convert as LeBlanc and syndra are dropped off the table they are trying to protect Phoenix is Zoe and a good match ups and make that one as safe as possible and leader of the Southland pool up so that they can get a an ocean of options Ford Viper they they split the difference obviously you get your Ribbon band but you also go support take the trash down and obviously going to be first pick support here for dig as they want to save plastic for Pfeiffer forgot it's like Shield definitely goes a long way against against that a lot of times it's just hilarious to be with set prices of someone who can put out in Wayne and that is a combination with an ash very strong pushing for the bottom side you know if you combine your volleys with your with your keys with your silences from Soraka actually like that, though so I can definitely really good overall go to the match up and see how she going to take Camille has not for you we can play Global's as well Twisted Fate is hereby fur throw down against ruined his work showing up Top Lane are we going to get the Renekton into it because this worldwide in the LPL redacted as bad used super effectively get tons of winds but in a lot of the other leagues between attempted Renekton use it at counter picks into stuff like Camille because you can go down and try and have an overpowering Lane put those not turn out and Digger just going to steer clear of that completely and play the support topside game on here for Viper to get on the back of Olaf I love seeing team used solo laners that can accentuate the strength of their junglers off with any sort of extra support on his back really changes the way that you can play that champion later into the game so we might even see him getting a spirit visits and a suraka on theme for Olaf they are really listings are docked up into the spotlight here it's not just going to be the bottom line for dig dog is going to have a lot of power in his hand is early game is going to mean a lot more dig at to see if he can set himself up to be a good vessel for Shen Ultimate Force rocket heels coming through but that should be the focus for this team and a big thing for me is focusing on that offend pick overall because you eat we saw was coming in we just saw the guitar to get the win upset to come through the back half the split Viper with that one and Sylvie says do know we will take the Camille let's do it when Shan comes through the Dodge don't block the Camille queue it blocks the gold kart and if Camille go somewhere else should help them and then gives them the dog do they say fore aphromoo can stay safe because of showing up and I want to see now how much pressure does co2 get topside how much can dig alleviate that and went elsewhere with garlic on the Olaf rag May well be slow to whole bunches already going to be drowsy wait a couple of seconds now look at the rest of the clothes going to punch but bragging is going to lose his life for First Blood and Dick couldn't have asked for a better start to this game does season is on the line in this game a freak and a level 1 kill is a huge blow to morale this is this is a critical tiebreaker getting either franchise into playoffs and that one is definitely going to sting you know why it went over to dardoch that Olaf we've been hyping up a chance feel like we're focusing on God and Sam select are Doc is going to have the extra long sword coming into it oh my goodness that bubble from Phoenix straight across the long wall they got fish in a frog has as soon as he fell asleep he knew he was doomed yep he didn't use any summer cells after that and the Talisman for the more healing and and he's here but he but it is a faster clear I like longsword if I get first blood on me like that because you get more PVP damage and trying to invade and look for fights but he is gone for the classroom faster PVE clear and said the case for him Miss we watch through I believe I want to kind of recollect about that that level one I don't believe fracas ever showed out of like a Voorhees about the whole time so I really nice land level 140 Chief had done so many times to great success in their history of the organization was really really clever level one that got them in early lead to burn to flash without him to kill or something else really powerful this case of children receiving end off a really nice that play getting over you started with the Sleepy trouble. Make that would happen if they spot fracas on three camps gun into blue buff they know it's the cancer gone be the fact of October they do he is topside and the only Camp they can post they wanted was the crugs to see if they have a cigar Don most annoying 80 carry in the game for junglers it's not something that you have a hard time killing it's the Hawks. It's the ass just because of all those early reviews and write off of that jar dock by process of elimination easily able to move over to drugs and counter jumbo carrots and he can take the bottom crab as well just supporting us a Ciroc Elaine that we were talking about getting that harassment down continually pushing in on sticks and do they have been pretty low here to look for their looks damaged right now can it be enough smoothie is a parking right now gets poked out a little bit with the fact that he took drugs down there that's actually pretty easy to infer and co-chief having to sit there and play defensively acting a little bit low I'll take bottom Scuttle enjoy the extra couple hundred Health damage I did but you're not play that you want to from now on and it allows Johnson and aphromoo an easy reset because they have to constantly worry about to collapse. Taking them they're not taking the back here for Johnson and Akron was actually cancel and they stick around just going to continue to pressure with the extra Ward hurt a lot of water has the flash early and does not take any more damage the chickens will at least for the fractions the result that. I've never spotted here and look at the equal camps on both sides equal item in the most cases well she saved it to level one who's the sunglasses this time of that froze froze up Phoenix burns his flash go over the wall and want to get into this one getting lower and lower needs to push out of his own jungle mad so annoying trying to get away from Zoe have Phoenix's pictures of blacks that follows it and practice they're going to give up all the pressure 6A by himself Down Under the tower Target jumps around not going to sound but we'll go down. Claims he killed credit cards burned by pobelter mean he is not in mid will lose without farm and now stick table TV back he was here and we're just seeing more of the killer week 9. The first two games they really Came Out Swinging they're not changing the pace up here at all completely offensive mindset star. Getting the first blood off of the level one then pushing it a head that use hot shot scouting out fraga's will time invade here on the bottom side forcing more Summoners forcing extra kills and even diving down there to try and further set behind that is really easy to use a Teleport back he just has the tear so do after attack damage down here just throwing out in the sticks. Trying to stack up and farm away right now and blind text Elaine Piper picked a bit more reason for the lane but a 15 csb as ruined completed for 3 called Elaine sheet is in he's got a fuel pump be by the matches going to play out and the pyramid heads up two on two or three one-on-one I should say. The lead so far against Viper but didn't off as a team the rap about a thousand gold off of Jungle difference in off of Bot difference in Turlock with all of the money is going to be the one that snowball in the early oceans 8 yep going to keep stacking this one shed is now level six so as you're looking at the CVS up there vipers looking at San United teleports are available for both of the top laner so it still could be an answer for ruin and until you know if I / can't either interrupted or tries to force it out with no top side pressure with Doctor something you could be an answer for ruin just a little bit more of a delay on that one the arrival of your Stand United regardless no reason for Johnson and a promotion stop pushing or they keep up the pressure on the bottom side keep biting those objectives vipers Lane in an awkward spot right now stuck in front of ruins turret with zero of vision at all CLG have a control we're topside and there was nothing that Viper knows he has no idea if ragged like you showing off or pulled out to my old up there and with testicles made him you are just dead so he is bleeding farm right now it is still afraid he's going to get far behind router with first level seven and Navy Seals you can find their went through top because they are down a thousand gold elsewhere so you actually need for range minions if it's right in front of your trip to keep it there indefinitely to I believe there were only three of their goal jugglers are heading up to the top side though as almost all by themselves lights to help get the first one down but overall just be a Smash down here in the bottom side pain CSD the only obvious this really rich off the kills you know that he's 40 gold or so the fact of course he had the really limp around through the Olaf has he heard a little bit afro also I like going for the more aggressive the arch degree tear support item and going selfies of the few bus play some aggressive me to get the same golden come a truck to the two of you does that that's what the fish do we need some degree to get those items online as fast as possible darlock now still finding it Mutual objectives to kill he's not up in Camp count really but it I'm too good Gangsta poke one could take off first blood and a lot of big neutral he's got the First Rate he's not going for the hair and it looks like I can test your practices in the area Twisted Fate ultimate is available for pobelter
