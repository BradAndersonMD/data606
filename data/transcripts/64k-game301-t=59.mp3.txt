let's burden on execution maybe last Champion Select we saw Africa freaks taunt Cloud Nine with a hover over LeBlanc Jensen happily punish them severely with that pic or see if they do it again already we've got similar bands coming out from Africa or got an is zillion once again all the same Nocturne get added to the banned list for a freak it unless they think a different Champion is more important here and they're debating on the last one if there's going to be something changing cuz keep in mind we are in the same size as last time a 350 shows reading game 159 shoes is blue here and let's see how much the draft is the same for the spruce 7 selections if identical copy to results are in that contain the word some nice moments for it we'll see if they can go that wayafreeca freecs side of the drop Dallas's up once again but a little bit of spirit free Predator after that moment I'm focused on the jungle difference from last game junglers here for afreeca freecs they will still get the power pic of Alistar the definitely and enabling support with your head but full price, you can set up killed and survived he fights with the ultimate and I'm expecting similar pics now for cloud nine to find themselves in early aggressive jungler and fill the brown from before because I can I can see this before pool being pinched pretty quickly and the run back of the same match up there they sell them if they do finally land on those brackets but I think the brown was always expected to hear and will probably keep seeing the Brown Palace or tradewhose head is all around possibility that world 2018 the tape has been getting faster and even though easy travel solution could not quite succeed all the time he wants it right away and seems to be some of those covers and stats the Lacs you could tell Cloud 9 feeling confident after that game that should be a cautionary tale though because best-of-five is a very long road as we said and now they've got a very happy ending here for the road know how do you spell skill so well into the late game if afreeca freecs can hold themselves in the early game they have a very strong Austin for the late and I'm loving the galioinstant given counterfeit Decor they were focusing on beans matchup Frozen 10 to the 1 b 1 and how it played out in the lodge of picture of a Champion Select syndrome and here trying to find this a bit more breathing room macura it is to one of the ones I want to pay a lot of attention to keep for Africa versus licorice and Jensen for class 9 vs care of those matches like they can go very very well that rides could easily go to Keene another high damage pop when he's already played it at world so far keep it at four times the lck summer twist and certainly a champion if you keep bringing out here question is though what can Jensen blind and still have that impacted Earth in game 1 the rise of another strong made into HR strong matchup in the One V one for afreeca freecs there if they decide to swap itI will get the answer to your question shortly free phrase lost in for Spence Karen do hard carry junglers here who can play so offensively Farm extremely quickly as well and look for him to try and context Mafia contract with all over the grave at Worlds in China this time it's been Scaris on Jensen to abuse his match up into Paradise V exact camping you expect when these teams line up here so freaking what do you do to neutralize Jensen's re re does even more important than your skill shot though get a decent amount of burst damage even if you missed the chain re not so much if you missed a charmwent to the match golf course I tried can easily go Medford curling team can keep playing this Victor a truck matchup it did look good individual eat in the previous game for 25 seconds till these teams can choose where they want to chance to Cloud 9 Dem a bare spots Africa will see if it's he totally trademark Victor for up for the new look for keys in the regular season of Summer now it's across an old pic it's one you can always go to but I think he's going to be here until they want to game number two are necessary as a result of game number one Cloud 9 though I do see a possibility of them lacking hard Phoebe and set up for this team competition relies on hitting these still shots for by good positioning from an 8-track trying to chase them without so there definitely is a lot of room for out play in this matchupoutplays always exciting when you get the best team in the world here ASL World Championship the last remaining teams from North America and South Korea here at World's End Mythic semifinal since 2011 when they weren't even invited every year has been Korean domination or at least excellent making the final or winning the title for the last five years right now North America has not made top four 2 2011 Korean since so now to win it best-of-five over Korea for cloud nine to make their first of my finals 2011 that would be historic I do think the title of the Last Hope vs. the only hope definitely a fitting one that has been bestowed upon this matchup and yet I think personally Kobe that history has never meant less than 2018 when so many memes about how League Of Legend players out both on a match by match level and also on a calendar level just haven't happened SKT TSM not at World the Koreanright now in a kind of a whimpering status 1 0 down with a potential elimination of the home region on the world championship team that there's a nation issues but I want to get into this one as it's such a fun matchup I do agree with that point papasmithy and it feels like in the past when people give you the a rose tinted glasses answers of to follow your dreams you can be whatever you want when you grow up it was sounded a bit Hollow and yet this year for League of Legends does ring true it does feel quite a bit different here this year now I think we have the same issue as last week's been staring spilled some of his glorious water onto his keyboard I didn't get a replacement so about two minutes of the ETA I've been given to me this one as we are pause before the game starts and three-point know it's a new one it might be the same I don't know it's hard to tell the same person the same Jersey to adjust to be able to adapt to spend time with the samewater mistake that you showed already out world I've been confirmed that was a new clip I couldn't tell that was the exact same action from back in week 2 of the group stage you hate to say it say it coordination here a little bit on the side of Cloud 9 get them situated before they go into a very important game number 2 as we've learned from yesterday's games in these best-of-five easily you have to put aside the previous results to completely focus on the task at hand and I'm a spy eventually have this rise selected bakura he's already paid 68 games does it cost at went to Rift Rivals afreeca freecs at the run the entire Gauntlet in the 69th game it's his first game on Raisa to 20 seconds unique champion and yet it's one that bassbutter butts so many other players so glad we're seeing these pics come out from both teams in response to what has been shown in Champion Select early we set up this game and he's coaching stats on both side you ready for adaptation of you willing to pull out these pics trusting in their players for the matchups and this time around in response that rise to re-sign up 1-0 over afreeca freecs and it's a very exciting match-up it has been a weekend of upset victories at first game was massive Cloud 9 did not let off the gas pedal that was straight under the right nearly a straight line I do need to emphasize how important the jungle and the jungle pick was in the last game then dial hand initiateCloud 9 Swiss Gear started so many of their place in the tournament is can bring a tremendous amount of damage does play the same front light as in doubt it's much different with a smokescreen really bringing the utility with this champion from there I'm actually zoomed in on the level one because I thought they did a pretty poor job of tracking spend scared of the gang on the Sims out what shows are free, wacky with pretty limited information to some way to curtail what it up in such a high temper game with Spirit reacting to the pro activity has been scaring and I say the word spread of course you must remember that was Mowgli in the lineup fee was able to watch game on with the coaching stop and to pretend she has some insight into Spence Karen's pop the big boy and honestly they should have been prepared for a level 2 bottom from blue side that to me has been the most common jungle start that I have seen all of world's coming off of that Red Bluff passing down through the side I did find success with it early ona little bit of harassment on to Cramer Novi Advantage should go to loosen Brom in a caixa Alistar match up here they're trying to get a Health Advantage supposed to wave at someone importantly Alastair Campbell doesn't have a level-one have to walk up and pulverize you and good players won't let you really land that anymore so it should be the first lead level 2 coming in first post jungle its release list Red Bluff and we have this in jail for Moberly going over to Crux to get a lot of XP in this Farm has been spotted by a war going for the spot side Scuttle provoked provoked a red water right way to see the blue one on the top side of the river that was spotted by C9 and that's why they're playing Buck side with the bra and pushing up the level 1 strength off the duo Lane Gray would have guaranteed money of in roast at least on to that Scuttle crab a very important to not get controlled in a double Scuttle opening from a Graves at the graves get control of the visionthe river I could be very very difficult we mention the quick speed at which you can form and also you know start to take over as far as the range Advantage right now mostly walking over the T9 Vision so they should know that he is in this area of the map and invading hordes the blue box anyway and looks like it's going to have to steal this one away from fence has been scared he went cross map to grab wolves and is only now heading over to answer that blue that's why we see to sin hovering up here he doesn't have any visit the place on it though if I die pushing bottom Lane is what allows you to continue on with this in bed you can see on your screen basil goes up to help fence Karen don't see how much time can I get doneI only took the one Camp just the blue buff then left do look at this he has not been spotted coming in a minute just to be hopping on the bottom if he knows his jugular is on that side but he's very far towards the top side here very close to Mobley who can charge in Pearl looking for a route with this room Fresno Flats but you can certainly try it won't matter I love you call that, because you're right you do see heading towards the size that you have backup on and said Jensen was being greedy or trying to play a mind game but apart from game one way you could really exploit those mine game times for Karoshi are very quickly into the game then since no movement at all instant flash initiation prefer Sentinels he's dead after that and that is going to be a you push that the minions as well to allow for some extra CS in a recall for quiltSummoner spells are just part of a punch board he Miss Polly want a name of the volleyball in the following night is up there and jump away with the Flash and good health card damaged their owners well that was not some high-octane stuff with this kind of tank doesn't come off we've been ignoring topside fit by your king wants to stay in line for the 1150 code but I first Buy on to the Expo upgrade but it's kind of freaking fix sticking the landing they're happy for this to be a slower Pace game only a single killed in the past 5 minutes and that's so big for the men laying here because now if we could priests have to solo Lane that are winning by the loss of game number one matchup predictor into a truck is a successful one p one in isolation bottom side has been pushing for Cloud 9 and has found two sets but now we're seeing jungle attention down there to fry and turn the story around you put me behind them know Cena does have both of their flashes available bus to Summerhill but it would be difficult but I can now in stores
