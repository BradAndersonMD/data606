rematch of a spring split finals in his number two and three teams the world I'm just speaking slightly Impacto and the rest of Team Liquid show me for several years now right off of the table very early from Team Liquid one of those flip wishes they had to deal with it had much time to practice on the human also following suit gas pumps in Lawrence right here with wheels come through this one is a Jason is also added to the band tools impact could take that one as well as cademy league is everyone it's so I don't have to go deeper into that story for the team. Be on the table. Liquid bandage on you in the garden that top plate or Midland the fairy Bible a scary on all of the flags at extremely good games on the champion and is definitely first Aurelia and Galley are broken blade in support of course very strong enough to support Team Liquid as they already have incomplete that bottom land for doublelift a core JJ which in Spring was probably the number one bottom line and leave but I will say I do love that Jensen Hubbard as real what do you think I have to bring it up if I'm worthy champion of Jensen and doublelift encounters like solution will Ben still hover an Echo Show versus even after that mistake and that finals you're calling back do some big game breaking a mistake because he locked in set up decide what he's done after galio goes in for the flash Hans of Teagan Hunter for Census Bureau people he was in at CC duration on either the Galleria lane or the irelia lane her being able to set up right side and always being able to close with the cue reset and then get those Auto attack and set course we already know is Iraq on locked in here the duo of the team liquid side hit a CZ Spotlight pic for has been just difficulty that probably next phase of fixes breathe what was the first ban over in game one as well and Cloud 9 in the turtle this morning has been so driven definitely being a high-priced big apparently yeah I've also heard a lot of priority on the silver recently in scrims for most teams with the rise of power of Crisfield Sperry recently over the last few patches John Silver's ability to get that wave clear so instantly makes for roaming for your support and that's great for something like a Leo man when we might see her band against then now as well as we wait as the time ticks down one more band can be and if they were dropped her off the table would open up the top side of Matt for logic record almost all of their spring Games Team Liquid Israel hola amor early aggressive how are very strong feeling very fast clears is Olaf and get all the way around the map and now you did last Dolan we need the most pick champion from the spring split for impact that Kenan but if you think that goes like that's going to be locked in after also Ken and comes through he's going to go right back and think of what he had which is very helpful yet exactly hybrid build going for some a pea in the hextech revolver upgrade super early on into the gunblade so you can also swap into a lot of a setup is not the best solo initiator if you have something split-second engage bike work on its debts up those big storms that big are we that people I dream about so so effectively on the side play enter here with your zero wall you have to watch out for that because it's such a good answer to mention also ways of pushing him out and and and knocking off for us the team Galaxy will do that as well so it looks like I have a very strong conventional two-on-two xayah rakan every early the phrase that is only to the second half of the W as well as one of those Champions poppy ultimate you can guarantee he's dodged that second swing of the W and then say 22 kind of there and you do whatever you want around the champion instead on this could be really powerful to see what comes in as you got broken plate back on the irelia he has been impressive impact the same though on this cannon has the kleptomancy could had a farm some golden convert into the mid game to this looks like a rematch of the finals of incredibly strong team to put that back in the fridge number two TSM fans been waiting for this ever since the finals ended beginning of the school year nursing now on is beer a champion for him as well but looking for a bit more scaling in that mid lane see where they start typically again he has done has focused towards the top side of the map ever since they added Broken Blade and this guy is really grown into a star coming over from the tsp really found success as the team grew and put more and more confidence into his play really peeking at finals allow it is Vladimir play around a lot of those fights in the NL Team Liquid were victorious they went to MSI they took down the defending world champions and their back looking for more by the way you guys are awesome thanks for that CSM and see how are much less active than you and the early game except has been living with you so we got you know five gold is exciting without setting is TSM it seem like a chance so they did get onto the Raptors so if Acadian goes with the classic red into Raptors and go get some early information on this Edge Ronnie and tracking will begin it's pretty effective for Olaf to be able to get a lot of Hannah jungle and early on you can see the two deep words on the map right now that were placed by Team Liquid ecstasy ask these to both of those games they do get Vision on this Edgewater freak as a marksman player and every time you see on the bottom side snap it happens sometimes you're the best of us. Just double if that's okay I feel better about myself and you can watch the first person I'm about this Midland pushed in by Bjork Smith make sure he's not going to get the set by Olaf I can have to just text me if he has 12 pallets and even less Mana as the War II comes down and says okay chickens already gone if he's going to be a 3 cancel could recall you for Smithy all right let's do it goes with here on the first recall because you can go move speed and he is going to go with the Boost what's a control board here for the vision plan on the top half of the map and he is water walking plus nullifying orb so he's going to be really quick actually going to end up between those Lanes in the river there that I could be pretty powerful, well we'll see as you can talk to the cops I know he's only barely a camp behind but you know with the refresh man Tamar and they know 100% that says wanting is bottom half of the map because they had to be bored on the above as well they know that they Sewanee will be threatening doublelift in Corte De Sol xmithie has full power and influence is irelia Lane hair we go sit Sewanee once again showing all this just grow up by Scuttle crab now yeah I was able to find it with the scryers bloom so please get some experience and gold for himself and doing stuff and then they will hundred percent on the bottom River Lily Awards already going to be traded as well we saw them previous game that seems really like that you come into it or and you tried those pretty equally red plus a passive he gets it he had the timed out and headed to write for that Scuttle crab I definitely also would have been pissed if I was the dunkler because you want to save time by letting the Red Bluff burn kill off just go grab me to walk away from it right now though getting a look at the in bed here from Xfinity on the go you got to believe I feel pretty comfortable right now is I can't even talk on the rest of the camp that was not was Gordie Johnson pretty solid and also kept impact safely went to the threat to seven broke his leg Yeah I mean they definitely do you win that to be do they want to keep up the pressure on the Troy to get your bottom to talk but once again we can see the bottom Lane has this small farm Lee Joins the Team Liquid Duo very threatening human touch on a little bit and Champion Select but the Zyra, I'm so potent early on a court date a of course was one of the stars for the team on the international stage as well you know I had a slow start I think most people were pretty much redeemed in their eyes 2000 G Series as well as a finishing up that term for difficulty and actually does run into for JJ I said and he's looking for the Deep Wards controller going down actually gives you an alert so they know he's there does getting time to rip recall actually get the recall off but just mean score JJ maybe what were you going to miss their whatever you do stay on the bottom side I should knock down the word or self I believe in regardless is 40 - 2 takedown now the rest of you is that you can as he's approaching level 624 the TSM side I would turn your eyes for say Szechuan e a r l e a combination irelia is able to set up the said why he passes so effectively she'd Dash in and also its best app for own done so there's just so many ways to see see a Canon who has very low lifes if you're able to land one that you can stain them effectively into a kill so I think that that is a very big point to can't text right now you can tell a Smithy also worried about this is the level 6 is are coming in right now that's where they kill pressure becomes extremely real Georgia's top with a broken plate search for 14 liquid impact with the slightest sidestep their Dodges the ultimate from broken play there is no cancer kill it was Liquid. Wayne first they find the first kill x movie still around now and actually not going to be any teleport left broken play head used as much as earlier that means even / plates on top of it that kill is more far-reaching than we initially thought EP down really make this so difficult all right Brooklyn play yeah I was in fact moving down he's just this is the ultimate there and that means there's going to be no countertop kits at Altima hid he can get the counter kill on to impact it's not quite as bad a situation still would be positive for Team Liquid in this world do that is going to be a very big group impact actually going to take that and go straight for the Proto belt he's not even going to go for he's kind of halfway point where we were seeing
