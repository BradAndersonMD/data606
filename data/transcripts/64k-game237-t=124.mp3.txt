are tough opponents and who is Rumble has been dropped off first fan right off of the table, the following two very quickly from mentioning the 9:12 bus but they were ginormous Jewish hat so much speed to the team now a toxin Aralia very common as far as our Flex pick power pick that are left with the Silas taken off of that list, and I've had one game on it but definitely priority greatly reduced as well I'm not too surprised you've gone from Pro play so what you want is fine but maybe he'll be a vital check in a cell look you don't say those words for us to be clear a fairly was going to sign up for the tank fish tank do to you if such wondrous trundlewhen we have our third spacing 21st pick as you me a band all right is this is Ronnie Dyson care enough about it they can take a later on honestly there are other good options to get better right now but it's going to be all about how she missed would want to play right I mean double it doesn't seem like they greatly enjoyed their sonidera games do they were effective sure everyone is a shock but I like the Pikachu face when I get to going through I want to see I want to see freaks version of the Pikachu face I'll take a picture of it and a lot of other sports coming in what does carnivore lira is on the table so there's the junk pick up no trundle I mean it is a galactic Vince Carter though is another yo very viable option vs. Edge Winery right there another one of those frontliners did you get that pic priority you can use it on the Tom can't because there is a Time catch on the team obviously you're going to have to watch out for whoever he's close by for the devourers but the very viable Target as well a lot of the times you can actually first him down before he gets out of the ultimate son inches thick skin and I'm going to probably reconnect you at this pretty early on after has upgraded sights Stone and I'll be the first Pit Stop easy answer seems like a very quintessential Cody Sun Vulcan laying here Cody son likes to be a huge damage Source later in the game 14-5 play Aziz bed Elaine face can be so oppressive Stoner Tom Kent as very very little to chill with left findings be spanned out and the long-range ratman from Caitlin I wonder if it's even going to be difficult going for klepto products for the Sona in exchange for you know the hell that you're going to have to use for it if you don't have the extra killing of the carrots before eating it this time around we have seen things like coins don't have either the Farm Lane there where are you know you going to go to CVS you just take the coin you get the gold that drops when the things you do you know when you don't kill and make your way up from there what is the rare build games like and Camille the bands for clutch his side he was going to move a lot of toppling often as he looking for a two bands that made the Twisted Fate and LeBlanc argan oil does lime pickles beer instead Clutch Gaming are going really good late-game here with us dear Caitlin wachs lots of long-range for later I think they're going to put her knee on a tank I am definitely feeling a tank draft if you have two tanks in front of this type of backline. It will be a very potent team fight the other end of course yes I did try and answer but it looks like this might be the case chase them poking long-range answered here with Team Liquid that could go to the mid lane by the way for Denton Jake Jace was one of the old pics that people use into a deer trying Pokemon early to get early lethality these have Rovers that might come into question or you can go for heavy Tok of course you can look at things like midlane is a collie will be grabbed play for himself either roll right now so typically impact has been there Jays player for Team Liquid I believe all of their LPS games have been in that order but they could fall a switch-a-roo year what will the answer be if they do expect impact to be taking the days once again we have our second LCS eyelid after the huge rounds of nurse really hitting the wave clear as well as delaying the shields than she have to land your stun on the Chain start using in The Jungle by the way as another option but we'll see how how many does up first of the chase sports game definitely missing one right here I do like texture effects of coffee you mentioned are very very good lately with your peeling back when I agreed very strong I like how easy is it to Segway your early game leave it you expect to have from the duel and a bottle and move around the map in the mid game you not going to the truck down with the Caitlin bucks each and then by the time he or a bunch of caught up you've got a cotton clothes at 3 a.m. is your point and it really does transition pretty nicely have plenty of Carrie Tupa forth with this phone of the adjacent is top as you mention the akali is mid and they're going to get a lot of healing healing and helps in the Tom kench to take the front line for the team liquid size and that Tom Kent told me to want to hear Justice write a reflective side so I might be a little more difficult for them to see how they can play through their bottom line for me here all right Team Liquid heading towards MSI crafted their own win streak looking to enter strong the Clutch Gaming coming in from the bottom of the standings off the back of some strong Cody Sun reliability and hooneys gameplay improving and we are going to be on to the rift Team Liquid your first place team I'm cutting my losses and 3:40 that is that's rough is not how I feel about this seemed all right well they're going for the in bed right now this is I believe we had to stack Team Liquid to are they just kill the warden back out no face check there money comes across lots of players I don't know what the five-man board XP if it's enough that to be a little too I've only seen it with three I know that you can definitely get it with three I think he even for but 5 might be stretching corned Ox down a zombie Ward rooms at work later won Gold chords AJ smashing the Botley matchup that's not true Vulcan 215 from hitting selfies and it is to spell tease for double if so he's going for those Autos kleptos felonies as usual even without the extra killing from the tereck got the Tom kench there in case you call Lynn happen yeah Tom kench looking to eat doublelift out of Finding Dory doesn't get hit with the infamous trapfinding combination that's very scary but also for late-game does Tom Kenny die in favor of denying skarner open it and so it's mainly an adaptation there instead of the classic Sonet Eric minions go down going to be none missed actually pretty son has all of them Elohim I talked to you last with the words you mind if I can just wanted the scoreboard lies to you but now that Pharmacy lost on the good side of the awesome Ford sunglass crabs one and then wait for the push for some more of this little book for smokin and really game it is ready for today taking all the farm school track how much you can be denied are you like I was going for the poker on the Vulcan less easy for Walking Dead the same as the fleet footwork Caitlin was super long range I feel like you know you got an extra potion that I agree with damage is definitely going to stick to Stained is it from using it once I almost there now shots and then she actually she was instantly when you play the animation on your own character you don't move right away but he used to block those ones out and stop link my stomach for this when he comes in but doesn't even bigger if I have a good start to this one has big way to farm for that way if there is slow big pokecord today's to level one you barely got out in time to avoid that trap as well walks off the edge First Alert right as usual for a daughter laying here with a Tom Kent and especially so which its long-range assault with Cody Sun involved in Caitlin and Lux is expected to get them early turret played for themselves as well as a large DX lead thing is there honey still falls off a real comes in and impact racing back and Who Knew by the way we had him on countdown last week and he was the one to say yes to Silas thirst no look very big on paper but he felt like it was still very much a viable left yet and competitive Champion but now we get to see him actually prove it right I love when we have to do to get to see the players put up that was getting ganked and that's going to be drinking out of the way taking very little damage actually doesn't even need to deal with anymore after that one yeah yeah that is from East J by the way I just tagged at 1 and up and goes control 7 Altura Road crank? For sure love it I do not have the 2016 Pro it is what is unforced to drop some Farm you have to imagine Caitlin should drop pretty much is 0 Across The Landing phase so far slowly work their way for $0.30 300 gold up from all that but pretty decent gold on the Sona here as Vulcan runs over the first room across the map with a brief forward trinket were two of them actually does the time that you would thank us so now we're going to start tracking xmithie here I like that kind of move should make me feel very safe in the bottling they see him up by the Raptor fit so it should be easy to track noise. Satellite else to do on the map except for spend some time passing by the amount another word that means lyric knows these clear up on top side but in fact goes for the recall after pushing in he does not grieve for trip play damaged with lyrics whereabouts unknown toppling recess with eight NCS difference there was an exact match to go to do all that much lb come in with the ability power coming in for 280 serrated jerk so done for impact mean you can be quite aggressive he wants to be Rick Morty come through and if I will walk his way back to Lanes with her is a bot Lane fight impact can join it who need cannot and will she probably catch the push in time as well it's very very good times I am packed means that recall losing their bathing Lyra unseen coming in Xfinity fully fully seen by clutch. They had to Ward's a new he was in the area now so there is waiting for the counter let me know he left on the river as well so they're going to push pull or maybe as well and out Goes lyrics recall even have a jumbo Farm Pikachu involves her up do right now is such a giving head larger through the bottomland they've already gotten one place and working towards the second pretty soon damage was that was not going to ask you though but that was running low on manahassett ET but needs to get back usually have math for 2 year for money for a tear by the way sunglass definitely helped out a lot with that so little bit more than usual tarek number and of course very high base attack damage the past has helped as well as hell to fix the damage is done so they were approaching I feel yeah that we need a few choose me I feel like they knew that there was possible danger in that brush cuz they were initially approaching together and then double starts walking in a zigzag there they had award or they have a work back to live at CCM too much maybe a baby be able to take it down GPS to stop the back there but it doesn't register damage in time the Cody Sun not delay that's very big the mountain Drake was actually in this situation is actually dialer the game because it is a Katelyn BGE service in the more you damage them the more the extra armor which tree damage can ignore so strangely impact for the mountain Drake another look at it from the TL side of Vision on that route cute yeah they felt like it was in there was some danger in there but if you do that you have to approach with Tom catch a lot closer Sona is very liable to get in first two down and if the binding hits both if buying for the Tomkins too far away to save doublelift that's what were they were banking on as their safety for stopping this recall that is just dropped the Vulcan Landing the double binding there for them to 100% the Sona and really give the money over to Cody's on this is going to find Infinity Edge progress
