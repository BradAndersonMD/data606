he's going to start kind of ramping back into the LPS in Skyrim starting now she's going to start putting Greg in a little bit to see which one's going to come in for week for ourselves as we will see if that becomes story later on but for now locating still a dedicated server TF2 original reason why Greg would take a nap equally to all of us is downtime what's good to the Champion Select oh my happy about that because it's been a powerful strategy and it's been one that cloud 9 was using before this week you know before we start taking to the next level with the chase Jungle of Stapleford 5 9 and 4 disc specifically there's always pick was very big one upon out for those you just run yes we are still on 9.89 point three being lied will be week 4to call Lee coming in which probably going to move her from Pro play so silly Kali band does Kathy have been as well as the note we have yet to see in North America but it's easy then and think is most played Stampy I just flipped I would be a contestant I would not be surprised and then Bandit to deny the first opportunity I know they care more about the urga all right. Here are available in the first round and that is going to be picked up quickly buys then we have the possibility of carrying it with ROM you know the combination of bottom way do I think is so important right now the illusion prom is Iraq on like those two go together almost as well as a champion that were literally did * 5.4 Champions League here waiting around for the counter picks and not rushing for any real as quickly as possible to get a kind of that solution the two mosthighly prized bottom winner Siri Sonos the price on this one that's going too far it's definitely a very very flash at least I'm still stunned bundle camps yeah so they definitely still very powerful in the jungle you can go for the early gangster lean and also playing other synergies with this Champion Camille very fast heart and gave champions in the entire game coming to the Jungle Rolf really compliments with some other form of for Tanki engagement on your name something people immediately think of galio because it cover the whole screen of a secondary engage that brings more tankiness because Camille does have that weakness of being able to get you know Focus guys very quickly other popular option include the love songa spa for support you can even Tom Petty people and we still see time spent a little bit rock on around there in the wings as well so you said wants to I got to wait for what they're going to ban away from Cloud 9 going to go to make their own choices now they know this list can be a flex pick broke but of course and play up in that Top Lane you have played it but instead it is very first responder most likely in that Midland and there is a fall open gate this is definitely a classic combination here and especially with the Ezreal as your marksmen you can add the damage from the ultimate from very far away on the enemy Mapsco TSM have to be so careful about getting picked up by the Camille and galio combination I think it's important that Braum's finds itself on the band here to get rid of sweet tea coming in they're putting up a shield that has Champion alive I feel like I kind of need to be seen here right now getting ready to leave soonultimate and drop that entirely and open Alistair Wednesday's is trademarked Gates Championship matchup is super fun as well smoothie even though it's not the most most people know him for his time on cloud nine right that's where he got most of his accolades do you want First Team all LPS support and he he definitely was a huge part of the rise of Cloud 9 or kind of the second coming so definitely going to be interesting how it goes up against days of who's the guy who originally kind of took his spot and we'll see if they do have that support battle that's going on in fan phase Right Now tips on Champion installs need to talk later in a sport you're going away to be a kind of picture that I would say most popular Eyes byOptics but also brought out by hundred thieves Sunday last week and denied my vote would still be taking brown right here since we can't grab it and they able to force the most places will be as forth from game in five overall crop the LPS and I put on Panic they want to play themselves and there is no surprise here the third pick here everybody that would be cool really going to support the year without really getting into it was used by the best dunker in the world Tarzan on lck the juggler for Griffin he was the one who kind of innovated it in it across the world that that's what comes from being you know the jugular for Griffith but I actually still prefer going with something like the Derp hog speeds up your clear and you can transition into Redemption not necessarily need to rush for it so fast unless you're actually going to go for it will make a big difference in the morning anyway thank you very much for me and we should go over a lot of Dolly stuff you know it was played over Europe a lot of the power and we're saying and tapped out come to a situation like this where you could already see all the animals with their feelings they also have a very offensive Lee oriented just lay here to propose at going for the early kills even onto a tank KTM bikes on people sometimes I want to see the focus from the jungle North American League of Legends players for the other team just another variation of the room choices here I've been discussing it's a lot with Dash cuz he's been playing a lot as well but we'll talk about Silas as soon as we get some info from Ava Lee thanks guys Silas the first pic that we see coming from Licorice and 5-9 reapered what's the inspiration behind the pic and why is it going to work today Mission and lysandra in a Scion or so so it's pretty good for picking Silas not going to lie Osceola rolled steel the game anything that you think you need to look out for from CSM today or not Reaper thank you and best of luck to you back to you guys and I really do hope that this Silas ends up having at least a significant amount of a female you don't have to go for a PS4 singing at jungle in bed here already since they do have prom that's going to be a lot of early and then gets to stack some of that manner and let me get a pencil Red Bluff steel is Olaf is still in the blue box to outside of a pretty crazy opening it should go pretty from this pain and back smoothie can't even tell that easily with a smite do they already got to fix up that Redbox deal and we'll see if the road is going to work for a Canadian to take the grand if you can try to go for that topside read interesting right because when you're going for his invite you would think that they're going to try and isolate it but already you can see it's been scared on the Camille is going across mat part of my training is going on in there that's a lot of damage but look the Camille is actually going to get off Scuttle nap to protect that Silas Lane even after going for the red invade here so Dave is sent Billy set up the possibility for a 3 bucks on Acadian traversing here since I guess this Scuttle crab I was back down can get bottom and protect his boots I don't need a kitty in the box then was warded coming in for their aware spend cut across the song when they saw him go back towards the Raptors so I want to see what the 4th Camp Fish Camp study for Acadian as you fear the entire left side and he is going for defensive players going down to his own cruds they're well aware that red was taken so is either an aggressive in bed but of course block by Ward will the biggest thing is the bottom line pushing here for TSM allow support for the jungle right so they can move in for text Acadian allow him to continue maybe I can test your inside the jungle let's take a look Midway know is actually going the favor of Cloud 9 phone if he gets to come down first and Acadian might have to just call it quits after the Scuttle take those Steel on the Scuttle attic and kitty one for them at once then going to let her be a lemon garlic is back to Lane and if he's not going to get touch stuff right here this is going to be pretty clean but no one wants it has pop forward and keep my heels you can't be tried everything taken more power clearing Spencer and I'm walking watch the patients on the Blue Buffalo if it switches targets one more time it would reset they just send it well do Cloud9 arraylist to hear that went for svenskeren that's pretty big that's really big is only one Camp left up for a Caden he is going to be down fat third Bop it's going to be a one buff Olaf the folk liras in response you might be down XP forever but is down that but the exact timer respond timer on small jungle camps is 2 and 1/2 minutes so if you count the five waves for your lane or are you keeping track and Subway like that you can get there in position for the next respond and they did take a little bit of a while delaying at the blue box but it will be kind of a top-down Fleer for him meme licorice on the Silas up your vs. broken play the early stages not too exciting sure as they're just training but you can see the bills coming out already and I do think that it's pretty solid licorice has a seriously so far with how much they've been tracking Olaf I am going to go for a galley of he's able to freely play the planet and not worry about Gangsta until now is it okay to get the first reset off and when the biggest thing for us is it really does enjoy melee melee matchups because of the power of the W right you can get huge healing off of it especially below 40% and that is what liquor is Max and right now he's going for the klepto for the extra games off of attacking Champions right now though one no slow single small chicken drumstick hear me to still with a kid in this one look up more of those Rapids go down it will go back to its Pain Care and so freely equal Trace right now it's Cloud Nine about 300 go to head over all as a team with some pretty solid Farm in that top Weymouth stuff to help him quite a bit as well. When it's sticky looking at moving to the overall gold right now so busy with double cut those on the team as well as gold inflation for of the discrepancy there there's teleport on sticky so is it to use that to get right back to land when the biggest bonuses of Israel and he has gone for purchase rather than you know waiting trying to get the last I was forced out and act as a Canadian early on that is a very dangerous thing as so much little attempt set contesting these jungle camps and liquor still feeling good trading go top as a burn their teleports as well we've got the specters Callie ever Broken Blade and the beginnings civility Powers theme examples of big proponent of Cotto belt Rush on Silas stop playing this means you're going to be delaying have your CDR like a luden's echo and Elena's like Lich Bane but privacy either couldn't quite get it sign it also it is one of the coolest ultimate steel for Silas though even if you do have a little bit of a pee because it does have such good ratios and I feel a lot of people steal it and they go bottom Lane to try and use their but you can also be used even in Lane if we do have jugglers coming up and now he's doing the ultimate liquor sizes when he's ready to look at something just want to run it right away is a question but the thunder thunder tour it's not just yet here and it's spreading close Tennessee esteli this ion pretty immovable but he
