that came 5 somehow turns it around I think that is so much more of a different because usually when we're in a situation like it's a game 5 for the second because other people learn something throughout the series I'd acted and involved and a big part of that has been Champion Select and I think the biggest part of the evolution has been about power of evil and getting him out of Champions if he can succeed with they've taken them off of the melee assassin's they put him on Porky and Ariana and even though they threw him off playing in game 4 he still dominated. Orianna vs Karma matchupalright try to force hoodie on and something else as usual akali Rumble Keanu here so it decided that it's still going to be here yeah and you wonder what they are going to end up first picking here Guy is available that was the band last time they were on red side Garner just like the last time they were on Blue okay so this is how they stopped the Hulk against cloud nine one card for them in the tiebreaker to end to go for the second seat anyway he has played Caitlin work successfully against our cost so I can take blinding it while there is still Morgana available is something plus games not going to do arelious was you wanting as last time around allowed you really are in a third of a spice the last time a nautilus support to reach back line and assassinate fix a will be the same as the rush comes through they had last time you had to put a face but there's the look of the virocon Away by a prostitute she wants it not I think they absolutely stood in this situation because then he could still didn't I recorded Caitlin in the second band plays in a would give them a lot of power however they won the last two games on Thresh so they may want to just sit on this before today or TV show up which ever one of these to get through they can put giving can you ignore bottom line right now been out the rest from Prewitt did I have brought that but they live did once again. Leona your answer to work on it quite well. Target ban the rest of questions Champion for this is the most important value over replacement is Yoda yeah they are calling back to as much hard engaged as possible even if the latent phase would still be won by CLG with Sarah Conover at I say hi Savannah I think is very wise hear that is exactly what Clutch wants to do is tile in after engaging I just want the best Hades and following up again though as expected clutch China Widow down on that champion pool Champion apparently yeah as far as adapting to what hasn't gone well I assoc Games 1 and 2 with c o g kind of drafting away from their strengths than 50 compositions and had to play around mid lane games free and for what gaming losing top priorities and not having the ability to play off of Looney on that side of the map so if they are to correct this series I think it would be with an advantageous match up for huniepop win and there are so many bands are popping already I think you're looking for something a little bit of all time that's real TV likely pick here for Cody Sun play the last time you was pushed down to pool we're right they're going to wait to see what they want to play for Hootie otherwise I got something volatile they want the blind how's it going to wait to get a kind of fish is really going to force logo shop has been played by who knew before they can always come in with him later on as one of finals on Tristana before of course it's a reason to play for him is to buy us but they might want to pick it up later give it to ruin maybe the power people are blind picked up the Vistana is very very top what you're talking about winning on top side of the map that is your go-to I was looking for earlier he makes it into this game with the steadfast presents shuts down a lot of the play making it no team fight old Pantheon very unlike to The Blind Pig beer possible Boreanaz Felix going to happen but oh wow ReRe comes in they've got a lot of anti - year if it's bench a few more what is the last pickup what is it and they're going to play all that set up cars other Karma game that be said if they do get the car man of the poppy just Farm the poppies for a bunch of klepto cold but Greek extra bucks diarrhea diarrhea Conestoga golf into a seem like a missile their ultimate and just is it going to save the same as he decided to re is Big Throwdown in game 5 this is one of those theoretical counter picks to irelia which relies on dashing so heavily and by the way yes talk about Ari if you were able to land that charm on the dash of Orillia it tonight so that should also realize the damage from getting the reset it completely stops the full combo re is Lily's book combo breaker in League of Legends now we'll see if the theoretical counter can play out in lane for that because they've got no extra room to work with game 5 bucks Win 4. Let's see if a reverse sweep happen zlg have clawed their way back into this series and they are so close to taking that third place spot clutch had Arisen soccer standings in summer have one game to go to level one in early Advantage will they catch who need effective wart in this bride tribe Rush makes it very unlikely a lot of times you do see a Karma rush for the brush that's the OG is in because of the potential move speed but see if she doesn't get it after game 5 to get a word into the mindset of Clutch Gaming obvious getting by with Coach Artemis things guys Artemis Ross last two games for the team what's been holding team back and were the issues resolved coming into game five I think we just dropped the ball a little bit in the first two games I think we just had trouble with executing on her compositions and we laughed a little bit of fundamentals so as long as you return to the form we had in the first two games will be fine crowd in a stadium or even played in playoffs and now going into game five this is a must-win yeah we're doing fine I think we're really tight so the guys are just meeting on each other and feeling good and they trust each other and I trust them and so dishonest so I guess we have a good competition we're happy with our draft as long as he asked if you will take on me in 5 we'll see if clutch can indeed return the floor that's the only problem was just loud they didn't play quite so well on the game and happy to not change their comms up and I think it was such gaming calling these seals Elaine swap Karma poppy match up yet again pretty big deal I don't think there should be the last time we see the teams switch lanes you have to be careful with how you time it so and I do love the guests are at and already strong two-on-two of Steel he looks great to get some training back off for us thanks to you Cody sun is already flashed with disorderly so big to get on the Cody Sun before he has Arcane shift at level two yeah they got the flash out of Cody Sutton yes it is Azrael who is going to be able to level up and get that extra safety and this is 950 by the way before the nurse with a cool-down of Arcane shift to still more slippery but that is a good amount of burst damage as well that aspendell power people from the topside pushes it in and gets the early room off to Mid no flat wall slam has burned his haste though if he really wanted a flash charm that could have been done but that's not going to play here and they have called the land back over and see we going to land in the message you want it going to watch how to get this up 1/2 simplify prostaglandin CC and sticks they charging us desire work on level one that is so powerful and needs to be respected can you wait if we're going to go back to match up that seal do you want in this one and they're pushing pretty well Goonies on going to be the slower one in this Lane right now, not much around yet either yeah really whoever can get the wave shoved out gets the wrong person I do think the time and thereby POV to go middling was the correct one but now as soon as reset in the Midway they're going to go back to get off if it's not a trading pattern here for the starter to help again the highway between top and it is so critical when they're trying to continually swap dispatch UPS weekly the first one there to no communication from no communication from clutch they lose track of a c o c inmate States paid the price Hootie double Summoners are going to be blowing as he teleports back out delay and it is CLG with the early upper hand here weekly ad harveyville real name flashes 12 Brewing Jetsam just at the very end of the rain in the walls plant find the stun setting up for the charm or who he was joking the potential charm which got him too close to the wall for that final stunt and also really a big deal to any burn the flash but nothing was burned in return he was still at a range of everything else was a completely wasted easily they could have chased him down it's a very easy to attack Karma kind of looking pretty good down here do still have to track the overall CS in these Lane swap wardsville because of how often POA has been back and forth he is at ACS deficit so yes Co she has really thrown some big curve balls but if your traditional Karma who dies after teleporting back and we'll aim that's normally a death sentence for so later he's really not that far behind find the poppy I think it's mostly stuff on saving the one that got to stay at topside first to level 6 has the extra CS behind this irelia they're really relying on him he is a player that has risen to be one of these shining stars of his Clutch Gaming Squad North American mid laners have been very very hard to come by and see what that's really been reaching for those limit 4cs highest of the game back in the bed laying on the irelia back match we wanted anybody got to the bottom side Folding Stock and shipping in time getting away if you see this game is only a hundred gold a part that kills paid for my good Landing spaces on a budget gaming Society Morris vs overall again I fight here in the middle and is not ruin has rejoined there is just so much problems going up every time she moves a c o g will move purse to match it and it's as Kobe mentioned that I was so important the river control does fit with c o g right now which makes their rotation easier and it actually giving them pressuring Lanes even though they they are outmatched when it is karma vs. Poppy and it's incredibly important to the river start a fire. Only at the river Vision in their control but starter spires to fix car door almost a new Champion so many steroid there was Vanna and it's an extra proven to be a very very scary in that River when they control Bose on Aspire so you can see their fear is not competent to just go get that Spider by himself has to work with Vulcan to take it over now weekly wants to territory back Nevada control it down he's going to knock on this was pretty easily that you do some tires for the quadrant of the Jungle controlled by the field division zombie were down there as well kind of want to give you a very good about the right side of the mouth
