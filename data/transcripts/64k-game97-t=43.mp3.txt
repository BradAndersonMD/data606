they haven't won since the 2014 spring split that was the end of one of the most in the 33 in the summer of 2013 + 29 + 4 in the spring of 2014. This best win percentage of any team ever surpassing their own Ford record but that route has been on 459 fans and after game 2 it looks like they're porchthat really is incredible I think that's that's the way you summon upright is Cloud9 to have the two most historically dominant split and look at it like a retake that and take the number one but because it's been six years group 259 things that have not gotten to experience Cloud 9 domination live they've been good International they headed to the world semi-final couple years back there was some really good moment they are from them but domestic success has eluded them for so long I mean a few years ago back when they still made out of a while ago but they are factored form now it's an old new roster if it's the last thing that was gone as of this year has come together incredibly well and as we found in which side is the draft of black with pink and blue they still want that. The choice that most teams make when they have toyit's something flyquest object against last game and in part pay the price for but animals tested a great job breaking it down how Cloud9 everyone first pic worn with set not available does mean that liquid is going to have to take something new. All right and you got to go play something self could not bring them quite into win then he was definitely been the best performing bot laners this year is going to be on the most highly prized champion in dispatch licorice were expected to have an outside chance that they could Flex that one pic into the mid lane and then takes a gangplank in the egg drop soup is something still loaded very well but I think the biggest thing here though is desire, the fact that because their bands got more limited and now it ignores most potent Champion is available and it's locked down into a pretty strong. It shows very clearly Cloud 9 says Hey set is the most important contestant Tostitos championship in the work on this is definitely a source of power and Southern right away no face ghost vitamins draft and now we're going through the band's end up being at the got jungle in mid to kontest now for our ESPN the game and I think this is so interesting now knowing that the first part of the draft has been relatively the same in most of the game has the most variation and one of the reasons the rakan is big on agnarr ensure the lady face and be good but it's more just what he does in the game how much he sits behind the enemy team and makes it difficult to go into a safe place and to meet thank goodness C9 pick someone who can help Affiliates his Mobility with the fellas I think that was the one big step in both like Westerly grass is drafting and Affiliates with nothing to protect him at least for construction off of the lantern in the play in the box and all these other tools to try and keep him alive so we'll see how that plays out truck game yeah it's kind of bring to the argument is that flight Quest was there were playing about giving him the most expensive champion in one that you can build around it was always about power of evil instead this time around this morning Natural Energy Efficiency on wild ultimate has the on-demand route in most cases the bands have come through three jungle bands come out with Olaf rek'sai and drag us all off the table and eat the cloud 9 we're going to grab they don't have that from the second one yeah it's standard composition for is something that is had a really high priority in a lot of serious but just because of the way the grass is played out haven't seen it yet as you mention drugs band means Garvin and the last thing that unites going to be holding his missing counter pick and they ban away the LeBlanc it was blacklisted me to fix that as the answer to us pants for early game jungle pressure sensor comes in as a blind bit later they know they're not going to be up against the oppression that was Yasuo bracket the previous game but now look around for the last game of the spring played so far in the split even though he's had such a fool by p o e i mean the fact that Andrea has been so dominant the rumble is the thing that you match it with I'll get into specifically how I feel like that match of plays out because it can go either way I seen it go either way in a lot of these games and it's going to be on C9 to perform okay. I think for the better that's going to change how big is our rooms in as the second best support this year the only man right behind is going to change the texture a lot I like the strap for flyquest as you mention Jack Cloud 9 get a lot of chances that work really really well for them you like the threat to help the afilia stay safe you like The Rumble in the passenger is well and I ate rocks we know liquor store at first glance I'm completely okay with what both teams did hear you can look at flyquest draft and see all the power picks in the fact that they got work on and you could definitely hindsight just want to say hi how did Cloud9 let's get these things but we've seen Cloud 9 make good rats look bad and make you know great rash look average and so much of it has been with how quickly they move around the map how well they play together the play the control vision and if they can close this one out with the current draft they have as we mentioned it would be the most dominant individual split in LCS history and Cloud 9 building off their own records it'll be fun to see them do it with this squad that has never won domestically in North America before you're ready to go into this game to see who can take it Over The Line Game 3 I do want to mention a small plate of history about 920 van slyke West in the series The Last us with v that cloud 9 or flyquest played one where they had a dominant game 3 windy Jihad 1 / flyquest EG have I ever Cloud 9 on those ways to the 303 so maybe have for the same happened with like what does turned around yep and just a note this is currently 204 Cloud 9 unlike the ones are you see at the top of the screen over here and early game I think it is really important to focus on the jungle pathing and what happens to the Midland porch because this syndra Rumble match up is key if in my feelings if the syndra pantheon plays perfect and pass around Midland it beats the rumble driving but if you let the rumble push with impunity and not get punished when he's burned his cool down while shoving the wave then the rumble can start moving into River and that's what's tearing his kind of hoping happens so let's watch where the early Wars are let's watch Rick Santorum past because he is kind of been the master of the pre 3-minute Gak my ready once again not a lot of really aggression in the very early game we've seen a couple teams go for invades late sweeper plays but ultimately we in this game we're going to see not quite as much happened we did have a fryer Blue Bell steal from the greatest of Cloud 9 in game two this time around or going to let the teams play their respective sides the map Red Bluff Police were both struggling since you're going to go read towards baseness starting Easley going to the Raptors and probably topside and the Jarvan going to clear it with his blue belt as well expect people to cheat a little bit towards that side what we seen some of the clever driving games exactly when they start read but then loop around to the blue side to get the gang can before they do that on what some jumpers there would consider a cheese game where they're actually for going efficient Farm in order to get a surprise and gank yeah I really am a fan of why was Bentley what they have seen of him more than other junglers is hyper efficient in what things might for example on Jarvan who's been purely physical damage bluebuff the highest armor Target in his conventional jungle clear to finish kids V can't wear as Pantheon is only on his fourth do in terms of overall paste that's an advantage since Central and hasn't gone for his normal game timing I mean looking at the way right now this is what happens if the sender's playing breath waiting is not punished by games you can actually get that level 3 shove on the driving but sent toward actually needs to be here to protect actually ganking at the right at the perfect timing plaid would have been there about 10 seconds earlier and Skip wolves maybe he would have been able to get a gank off on a POV but so far so good for flyquest Deborah Leigh syndrome happy we playing at Freddy's part he did board topside River and then she did to that side of the wave pushed in realistically easily guess we never stopped when the flats Sun Liquor's burns his own flat but he will go down three games in a row that play. How are people shoving that first wave a lot of times a cinder will go back for an early recall their get like a second or Inns and that's probably what she thought was happening but she's cheating the CC not even perfectly just getting the pantheons done into the burst of everyone else is enough to bring Liquors down and also very important getting that first Blood on the symbol mechanical pick up here for licorice love giving that went early on in the Orange versus Spain to stay healthy in the one as well as golden come down the line that is an underrated was the movie purchase plus if you are forced to an awkward recall this year that pays off down the line is a much worse recall comes through for this key he dropped the Ruby Crystal and that's it. Are people going to feel that we're going to go with the main reason and the extra ability power Target on POF but the fact that he's been able to get that really recall blasting on does increase his threat in Weymouth if he has santorin what we call shadowing him where any time you'll go on p o e stand for after this. As well as the land that you'll be able to shut himself as we as we shouldn't mention to Mid jungle has been so critical and C9 success it is. Who is take control of it at least for the first five minutes in this game 3 also thinking of control bot Lane so far going well for the Cloud 9 side we know xayah rakan is one of the scariest feeling pretty good about that matchup 5 and 1/2 minutes in the bottling and gun for great control this is going the way it has kind of all students lockers best by far the best bot Lane and leave completely lay down I think that's a really good call out in terms of matchups in a regular split C9 their entire starting roster was first-team All-Pro there's no argument that they were all the best performing in the world but in this series in particular the biggest Gap so to speak has been playing pretty even dogs even had CS advantages as an orange into licorice has been playing quite well in Saint torrent has been getting a lot of really getting for his blood a lot of it is actually been has been involved in pushing the tempo down bottom Lane getting kills get it yeah I mean Cloud9 are getting a lot done here through bottling we knew ignore was going to be one of the vacation to your flash West number to All Pro support right and it's not for his lady gets from his Romeo from his right now he's being pushed out of the unable to win the land itself of course start showing trukhina flexes off on him through fine for roof of bladder drops actual person see that our guy goes so incredibly well plan on going to kill in the Ford Model 620 CS behind. But he's the one able to threaten that also really crucially wildturtle unable to flash the jar viniq you cannot buy enough time for everyone else to follow through and that's the part that we talked about getting wild turtle down getting those plates keeps denying in it it's looking pretty good but if you want to put up flyquest r600 gold ahead if there is to be a game 3 win Flacco's have the makings of it right now where they're looking really good middling plainly definitely possible to do not want to count flyquest out right now about 9 though still going to do their best to run around the map
