well I have now we are the champions like the right away let's see what else is teams have in store and a lot of these continue as real not allowed soda not allowed to more than Bandit like last game yeah I will see you face to keep everything the same you be would be kind of fat bird that has been no getting banned Outlets are the series but I will be the atrox actually it take to get first pick stuff up in this is Paris instead TSN Milos move their bands all around the world and that Silas could easily be a jungle could also easily be a who need therapy and he has played a lot of it and still look you I know whenever I turn to the dream he's got a lot of very good things still to say about it now you can use it very effectively as a counterfeit for a solo lane or does defaulted back your jungle if there's no good matchups for it I would say it's no surprise to me and I kind of have dropped it was not very effective for them in that last and they did not die off any good engages with it it was so squishy you got first sat down with his early to at that's built and if you're not going to take it to take me to way makes a lot of sense because at least the last game sit back sort of dial kind of expected after this more aggressive listen to workout in game 1 of the Jungle you already have very strong like James Callaghan and I'm assuming that Jason will then be drafting for elastic top later to pair well with advani you're talking about irelia Renekton movie types of Champions that can really be a powerful Duo very very strong Champion death last game six in a row for Cody sun is he's going to reprise the role on a great lake in stamping you can certainly make things happens again one more pic for collections to come through 40 hits and gets their final say in the band's begin again yeah silver gives them a lot of late game option as well as it being super easy to spell shield sequani ultimate hard for the long range projectiles land on that parchment and even more so with a Tom kench by her side. Do I will just get them wants to go that route if they do then know there will be a lot of targeting for their bottle and likely in that second round Advance cuz they wouldn't have the parody there but it will be well I'm actually as the lock-in so grabbing the support not when you get pushed down too far as they're already you know is that you've been of a faun band and the Tompkins hasn't taken away. It's always okay let's get robbed cuts off the damn it so effectively the counter top of her kids breaking the projectiles and stopping the Ricochet so I think that's a really important take to get in in the first round here why they're not waiting after the second round of van and it goes to further tore up that huge by that they're setting up a Brahmin it says wani is an amazing front amount of beef for v i v e v ultimate battle have a marksman in the bottle and so New Braunfels double marks and Meet the Browns are going to go off almost instantaneously in the team fight irelia getting harder than as expected you want to take clutch of banning away think that will pair well with the 20 in the Top Lane I would not be surprised to see Renekton taken out as well but couldn't go up there and it's a broken plate again but that is not really work out for them last time so you know question maybe less worried about that getting locked in also since I left his shield is now a magic damage Shield you don't want if it's a spell Elaine Silas to be in a matchup forces attacked him & Threads like irelia they have a lot of insanity far as first thing I'm down definition of life harder so Caitlin gets dropped off now as well safe a cleaners remove the Clutch Gaming side making a little more difficult yeah clutch a really been targeting the duo Lane multiple Marksman bands are multiple support bands are actually quite mud quite common but definitely goes with the Earth Stood Still not doing anything at the Super Bowl is just this big sponge of 8 feet that's what's great against at the silver Bolt from the same here incredibly powerful and feel a lot of bright lines are to protect his veins so then gets going to be a huge picture of Bane versus a silver with the vein Advantage much any time that's ever got us out of it becomes a game of silver trying to run away very quickly play free reading getaway by yourself going to try for his most playlist foot already his third game here this excited I was about to go out to eat now going to be that for the vein and helping to lock that down and very clearly there's an art what's our answer to the vein well it's dived get on top of the Vape dive into that back line utilizing a rumble in the key on the Silas due to crash in The Collector wants more Renekton not going to be the option there and it will be kled into the rumble Rumble you have the early push you know that you can itemize into armor fairly effectively though it is not the mix name is coming out of the said Juanita but you do have to be very careful about any potential to be Jews because Clyde + a 22 way I'm a top SciFi especially I mean we didn't get to see it last time around but that's what we're looking for right of it just right and it passes from here so well together however number to forget them actually to effectively use 18 clad ultimate because they never got a good engaged for themselves with that many tools at their Disposal & Bram on the front line rather than laying there looking to create territory for vein to work with power in this lineup and some spicy or pixie or if you are looking for an easy chain for Silas a fall that up on the Corky and the potential burst combo that you can pull off their on to him this is certainly looking for that solo kill potential is he ready to go to the game here I go with number two as PSM Inlet Square up yet again at CSM Fable to lose game one so freaking then come back in the series still winning a organization NLCS history book clutch made them look a bit still in game one I got a lot of cover pic Series game 2 yes I'm looking into redeem themselves for last time in quarterfinals when's clutch knock them out and collect looking to build on the success of game number one is Rick mentioned in the first game as well clutch so successful in the early game Lyra himself on that stylus First Blood All Summer Long only second to what are the MVP candidates been scared herself and nothing really interesting to let this is bugged I've seen grasp Rumble now this would be to brawl with the cloud this is very clearly of annoying deck 510 get on top of you and scrap with you and you can very easily prep one grass and then he's really match if you keep in combat your new your swimsuit in the minions then when you go in you can potentially get one right away and get a second at the end of the trade alright more inside words here for real this time take it away thanks very much gentlemen I just spoke with Artemis of Clutch Gaming asking about things going the way that you want and what are you expecting out of this DSM draft you said games are going great the players feel awesome and things are definitely going the way we expect to see SM keep saying they exist the game is ours I asked him what he thought about the Champion Select Amigos guess I missed his playing exactly what we expect them to play so it really does look like things are coming up Clutch Gaming right now for that team back to you guys the grand much rib this could be a more interesting game to watch the one thing that I'm going to track exactly how clutch can play as their end game because in the previous one lira is annex Charter was actually a huge deal with that impale I think I broke like several times they got the universe parent take his private part a result of that and this time around they don't have good Hart engaged to a silver make the team of walking shoe but there's not a reliable CCR you have to remember that you can still settle and you can still said one of y'all switch does give Silas more ways to start a fight you can just collect all your team and all of a sudden he's super speed up a little, you are going to be getting in there sometimes a little too in their sure and and that is the thing right sometimes you need to take your Champion to make use of that moves me to just run headlong into a meat in clutches line up right now is married and it's heavy Barry offensively and Silas is well from the jungle so you're Homie real Pinkie member that's going to try and get early tank items is the Comcast but that's not really the initiator here Wego those good exchange of the vicious strike from broken place trying to punish who dies who need puts him under the tower is key to know that he didn't actually hold on for the W skill up in case it is now so you may not actually have that active which does give the rumble a higher kill potential if you can actually just not him but now coming towards midline Silas looking to figure out it comes out in time does burn some man of yours and do as you can speak get some right back there if we get a biscuits Demonte holding water as an element whenever he can sail mention water is the element that you can get your CC off with Keanu and you can guarantee York used to hit with your E-Z Up grab water and you wait for the full down to come back and then u e q u hit the root then you pull Earth and you get your auto attacks in between and Earth has execute damage so you can actually get them well with you tonight then you can essentially have after each other and that can be a very very powerful purse combo if you're suggesting that the land has a recall hearing about who's going to start pushing much faster I hear some of that far over the can a minute in that way if he'll lose 1 million most basically and Demonte should be safe getting back in double longsword and he'll be back in the next no problem have your two matching to recall himself and adding some inventory himself right now he lately just go to TSM by 300%. A lot of being mid-length right now and I want to track junglers after first recalls usually hunie you can see it on the mini-map he pushed up very heavily on Rumble Rumble Auto purchase with a flame spitter such a prime target in speakers go in the super common route right around behind him can broken play for Syd they want cleds it started out spot us they don't have rain jackets wrap flash comes in and sign nicely. Who not going to be able to write that one the second son will be there maybe going to be on he was still alive despite not flashing early enough that she avoids to tether yeah that is the ideal gas tank for TSS you get your flash early on the Clare to ensure that your fullback happens on the great job on a rope they get the stun not able to find enough damage to finish off that killed though and a Hootie survive even though it was when you on the run and him having to worry about his wife now both top laners are possible targets let's take a look at the damage output here and see if there's anything that's early 5 from Broken Blade good job by Hamden sure that he's going to get the joint back then we could get that he didn't quite get the knockback he says walked up this is extra I don't think barely unable to finish off that kill yeah yeah I mean honestly I think it's best you get me be the one for one I don't even know if you if you get exactly so great job to survive and certainly did not look me Miss played at all there by TSM so he is going to survive and building for Words early Tabby's as expected she's very very powerful thank you for coming out of gays 4 clear dunking do you can still come for it's going to be disengage much going to stay alive. No level six is for the junglers yet speaker does not have the Sichuan the ultimate so that is another teleport use this when was Fannie bottling if we're just going back bottom anyways not quite that big of a deal but I mean I'm actually really want to make more of that because they have TP disa vans on the top side and its infernal so now you can potentially TV in the rumble so she says can't actually really challenges dragon wrist is broken plate cannot join they are moving over for it so we'll see if they keep me in a bit as well so we can be one of the first one to be here will be who needs rumbles he walks down the river but keep in mind we're going to go for healthy maybe but at least going to build some space with piercings the Miracles field by train that comes across tsf TSM getting there at the end to come out with extra gold Broken Blade Romy down on the cloud with the ultimate is able to stop them and cut off the exit point
