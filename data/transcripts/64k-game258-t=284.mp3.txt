I work at the trophy what they're both playing for here today and we're going to toss it out to the casters at the teams headed to Champion Select thank you very much it is time for a rookie vs. Faker Invictus gaming vs SK Telecom T1 skt's return-to-form started with winning the lck once again they gotten that one back but winning the lck is no longer the proof of the best team in the world feeding IG is the proof of your the best team in the world in the road starts here for sap Baker in particular had to watch on the sidelines everytime Altos Taqueria he's just going to be a stream. But today in Ms I get the Battle rookie about to happen so and none of themfrom IG so respectful after cleanse rek'sai game today absolutely dominating they're going to last band the wreck site and as much as everyone has always want to see Faker vs rookie Ming and Cliff have fought in the LPL to my favorite lpo jugglers because of how explosive ready chance leg looks by see his face he was interviewed and talked about how other team could play the off meta stop the different stuff like the Sona tiles example used already claimed every time the sun comes up with trying to take over this Lane do you have a 9 in a rowI just want to go for roaming don't let the sauna get her products on you or do you go for the kills and Draven I think you know which school of thought that champion flysas play Love episode of Tarak versus you would have to imagine Draven and notes does get out of the house before they need to let Faker and Duke include Starcon Popoff Indies team fights be really going to get the shield going to get the invulnerable Atif she can do a lot of glitter on his team fights but as you mention it's about latest the spiciness Nautilus and Ravens going to look for those killed on Sonos in a row we had those non-interactive but it says it's going to be a Farm Fest this is the sort of fault line if they're going to throw a tension on both sides Raven just shout look at me and you better be here if you're the jungle are because there's so much possibility of snowballing office bottom side if Draven Nautilus does not get really good does not cash in on the Draven passive beaten never double Sonet Eric Team 5 comes to fruition in the mid game how I can Sonic go is very much p.m. fight and specifically Baron control division comes as Katie probably looking to the jump to wait to see if you want to keep you well supported to run around this device with all the shield and vulnerability this town for work well in the five-on-five we will wait to see there's Wrangler as IG will grab ning's Champion first but also now knowing where it though so winners are we get to look at the shop on something maybe instead of Kennett alright Kennon with the on hits definitely has a huge potential to take over on the top side we seen the emergence of the gun blade build as well so you can still have the big AP affect later on in the game but again we're saving the jungler pics until last pic is why I was so hyped for this matchup hear the choices that go into how you're going to play this game now that there is a sonidera crow Raven from the Jungle 2 Jungle cast farming but she still has feelings too insane to drop that we're getting in this game we're going to have fun on his Camille will he use his kid a big difference storing or full clip once again dominate predictable if it is yes we do predict but side the level two commands can be finding a lane that she likes to look up and we are going to see on screen and expect any more movement's hear from these size going to be such an exciting battle Invictus gaming the best team in the world they did follow the G2 but you can turn into beds right now with the wind right here rookie always said I have to take down the proof that I am the best at rimac not the same without being here in your way I text him in front of them here the World Tournament of champion and now we're going to have the class that everyone was waiting for group stages a single bed versus ID doing the best teams in the world ending world champions Invictus Gaming & S Kati the historical best team of all time pilot still by Baker in the midline D best player of all time and no one would ever dispute you on that and level one already spicy with a hook not yet going away and I might be engaged already has done and if I have continue with some damage these players are on the edges of their seat ID price of this game is not disappointing guess what drain even got the kill for Invictus gaming Meanwhile Back lid on the leasing get SK telecom's early gold honestly think that both these are kind of happy with where that money went and the reason why I picked this up and get to that do a focus on the start the blind hope it misses and then that's double Dazzle Harold's in the meanwhile it's a stove griddle at level used as well so Teddy will not have either Summoner nor will Nautilus on the bottom side then Baker and I lost switching spots there so the reason why I G keeps on the invade if they want to take over the but I might this political jungling West tournament I don't have that jungle outside with someone that means that raven could do things like this no items purchased for either Lisa North Raven but I'll let playing aggressively in the bottom side does go in for that hook they're really trying to take advantage of this matchup he's got the skin he's using now name the level to Red Bluff in 2K targeting Faker greatest player of all time down yellow to breathe but not much more than that of authority a fight in the jungle clip as well they put it in the hands of men can't look at the 200 hp enforcement early Recon release in now stuck inside No Man's Land driving to be easy even 5 yet another word for fights and how far solo and then out goes IG yeah Jackie Levin bowel I think our little bit too low to fish off of continue dive there but be objective is completed they take him down and I are still fighting constantly 1100 gold with IGN and this is why it's so early quid does stick around yeah he's going to try and come down just get the extra Kildare jackeylove flashes for the second kill their on Draven catches in a tiny bit more I don't think he's been catching that many axes in the meantime but the bigger reward double bus down there in the bottom side against no flash Dona no flash terrorists may have gone that says never finish donut art game played with professional Korean team in it that was no games in the promotion in the final and the word wasn't even in scrims Korean teams were playing stone at our exit the first look we see is SKT Lafayette in a handicap in the early game 4 minutes make purple planning phase right now and keep mine like this was gonna stare at you track the 80 Karen the one side jackeylove for support on the other have a good one population 3 as it'll kill comes through a 30s vs irelia is dead I mean you would want to you understand why this donut Eric would want to leave that lane without a lot also says you know what I can do as well he didn't even have that much impact hear its name again on his signature Camille goes in camping bed get this done onto Faker jackula was pushed up the bottom line in the NHL I'm sure it's got more killed at this than minutes in the game and now numbers fixed and they giving him a jack you up on a killing spree 5 minutes then they are slaughtering to the Jungle matchup between many ways they try to get there. If you log into your free time on the bus side couple of shops Lane hasn't even upgraded a lot of junglers stop using Cameo after the nurse like you admittedly said we're mostly targeted at farming ning is. Farming jungle monsters then is farming Champions constantly getting these engages Landing the son for his teammates and now I G set up for tremendous success only 5 and 1/2 minutes into the game more kills than men it's always a great time for delfi LT Mane IG firing all cylinders the shy maybe not going to be a major factor in this one 5 and 4 vs 4 and 3 to go by for round number for down here and teddy as Martha's phone number 11 he was on 10 2 minutes ago and it's it's just that figured being there doesn't even allow the many safety the towers still going to go down I see you're not only going to get those mid plate but also in the mid lane rookie has made with push up those minions and Clinton was the only one with left to defend he can't stop the rise pressure either this is absolute domination from the defending world champion PS4 controllers on the outside of why you have to take the longest way around it's a tree Rose Lane in the butler I know that you're laying with her Tumblr or fake a rotating through but it doesn't change anything but plain when is inevitable and the timer on Penny and mother having their items together it's so far away the champion picking up CS this is why games where the top winners are both like? What's going on the map on the bottom called Teddy and not today the best bot Lane in the world and right now they are being handily dismantled by jackula balance and of course these rooms from ning now yes the first blood came through very early on or at least the Adoration first killed during level one but didn't shop with that it was several kills them in the house be upside down more partying and then flashing for regardless 2% KP for employment training slicing maelstroms but the shy getting the better of that's right now I got to take a visit as well comes over and words but kind will be able to slip out and once again and then flashing for it this time around forces the engage onto Faker and they get the kill once again it's over a 5000 kg is threatening just roll over the top of them 1900 gold and either bought women are less than anyone else in this game SKT clip actually make things will come out not going to find the word happen to the queue so he's going to stay alive on this one as an ocean Drake makes it even easier for an IG that's already had no power and found out
