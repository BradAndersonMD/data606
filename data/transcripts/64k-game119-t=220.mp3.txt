I can Mortals in a best-of-five scenario because sure they might have the potential to drop one game to a pop off like dignitas but they are probably not going to lose three in a row in about 5 scenario if they got to get it done here though today with a single victory over take me to talk to move into that Sixth and final playoff spot clinched it all up and moving sales in the postseason The Mortals think it talks back over the chapters one more time close out today once again to the last cast of The Sixth and final playoff game with the wind right now in Mortals wins nine wins nine wins will always clinch playoffs base and how it's going right now meanwhile the Digger talk fan the Team Liquid fan and golden Guardians fans are all straight for the guitar fingers crossed for all those jeans that are depending on this big ass to win a lot of teams outside chance to still make it but a mortal can close the door on that picture of their playoff spot dignitas though pretty exciting game last weekend and I'm really excited to see if he's willing to look for the pic like that thing Cloud 9 go to furoshiki number 22 all right well as getting removed here as well as brings out the mordekaiser and belly of water damage already early on and just becomes incredibly difficult for someone like you warned you actually out of your healing rather so that is really really tough to deal with that being said or you can almost always play defensively enough that you're not actually fighting for every single CSU can warm it up you can still be in the device and we haven't seen more of that affects the cross the ALCS split so fast track and Hootie get enough of an advantage for the make this worthwhile and with this potential lock in here of Nautilus that will be the full bottling locked in for dignitas where what is a gone with mid jungle cancion as well as that's in jail that is a really really powerful to be to around mid lane is also incredibly strong enough to utilize room enough for stop by Pantheon altering insyndra rap 7 priority in that Midland so we're going to see offset and now we're dignitas very likely going to be targeting bot laners for Mortals mortals can be targeting at Mid and jungle Duo trying to get the most out of these early pics of hickeys yeah it'll probably would be wonderful there is why I wouldn't be shocked as deeply as soon as you're bottling hasn't done it this year but only if you're going for it maybe you see that one broke through and you put the pantheon I got to know where is playing something else maybe we can agree there is no chip to see the person Fort Bend come through already I like him to the second one came through as well so you can stop and have to speak out there somewhere, off as a hospital special into Nautilus that's obvious kills to block that is not an ultimate time to blackfield it if it's used from any sort of range that death-stars though it is definitely one of the four through the LPS that is willing to go to work some of those range pics of course if you want to go for a more option there's still things like anch which could make sent along a pic like the pantheon add more Stanley Global threat to one can be definitely strong so we'll see if it does come through the jungle ready stuff for themselves right now is Top Lane to find out if you want to play mid laner or if they want a pic of a triangular and wait to see what else the rest of going to be Olaf have you locked in there for Acadian in good hope you can get a lot done with that a very interesting seeing you lost lost in is a really strong through lead anchor when paired with someone who has really strong walk down like the Nautilus so has the ability perhaps it was laying eggs and things like that can be actually set up by that Nautilus also will give you a really strong to be to topside when you already have that winning match up with the mordekaiser for Zoloft shows up you do expect when any of those types of matchups defensive I think it makes sense if you're looking play mostly around top and mid with his Fancy on and happy as drill you could even go to something like that song and she didn't want to go really defensive do you think I should be okay here also yeah but the odds are in your glory it's do-or-die time and they go back to Old Comforts floriana for frogging complete as to this is what I hear by the Ariana going to make sense especially alongside that Olaf people love that combo speed them up Shield them up in the middle of the team look for that Shockwave also good follow-up available off of the walk down that a nautilus does for by but as you did highlight this is the same bottle and we actually talked previously from CLG but if a leo send Nautilus or not the Champions that can really dominate it's actually hard or Nautilus to actually engage into a top cuz if you hook the Azrael he can get devoured of you actually hold on Tom and then threaten you with the Atlanta police tow is going to be likely more of a farm-style lane and I do think a lot of the game is going to be decided on whether or not Anthony on and make things happen especially around this midlane you can send it feels like is Eleni want to fight around and that does leave them with early limited often and I'm looking at dignitas and I'm looking at its difficulties and it's totally out of no where they've got open spot at a playoff but you know the odds are getting lower the odds of getting a lot of bok in playoffs with the wind so much tomorrow hello and welcome back to the show with LCS time and of course now over a thousand Playoff scenarios possible we're down to just 64 right now it's all of them and with The Mortals making playoffs identities below the make it in if Immortals wins this one here today we'll see if it comes through we do have some is Griffin ready to go as well let's get into as Immortals fight for that last playoff but I was at the top who's hoping to do the same can be exciting one we're going to have to seek and dig the playoff hopes alive or not only themselves but golden Guardians DL all these teams now cheering for dignitas in Immortals really looking to close the door and seal the deal here become that final playoff beef and then tomorrow we'll just be all about playing for seeding just incredibly important when you are looking for that top for to be playing from the upper back to be playing for double limb very very important and no one has any sort of dominating lead except work last night also want to point out that there is exactly one scenario left with six tiebreaker games and if you want that you were also rooting for you in this one just saying that's what would be on the table here have you still got a bunch of different scenarios available for Mass tiebreakers question is can dignitas stop a 1 and 6 second round robin streak for the only beat 10th Place CLG can it be the time they Buck the trend it's been a really lackluster and they brought a new jungler and akkadian that didn't seem to help very much either but they're going to do the very best it is one thing they can strike audible didn't have a really good start with a split or call they were born too early on frog and one player of the week he was popping off it seems like this was going to be a roster that they do some big things but it just has not been able to remain consistent and it felt like what was truly season advantage or dignitas weather was never asked kind of tailed off further into season we got that Advance has dwindled away Yep they're still
