but if he's losing Fatima still closed behind them they play each other tomorrow if EG when's the day that your top 6 in the top half in the first round have yet to get a 10-win split in their history in the LCS at first year back to back pain it got better year was can you get a positive with rate split can you get 10 and 8 or better and EG is our chance to do that hereexactly an mp4 thinking that they were going to be able to get to it for sure you know based on their their recent perfomance they have been looking really good. They were on an 8 and 3 run for them they can achieve that 10-win slippity g would like to deny that and secure their upper bracket appearance here for playoffs golden Guardians also still hunting for that first playoff win so that will be here waiting on their minds does it go into playoffs then you do will go free picks set obviously is a flex pack but most of these days we are seeing a fair bit midlane as well as it has been acting more popular mid-length then top lately shirt yeah Mr Lyon right here of course everything but Caitlin is available in here and go from Oregon to hear the junglealso could have gotten better over time picking up win after win now and we'll see what easy fix and response despite having some pretty strong your individual performances you know it's lame Horizon to Brock the but it was still in a lawsuit I do believe those are also out of their dragon so lost games so he has been good in the early game but you know him as well to team obviously he's just one part of it have been unable to close out games when he is on Italy will see if they can Rectify that here looking like Senate can't stop it up throw back down in the bottom Lane going to be a sissy if it is Farmington it feels like that has a dent out of the go do yeah we're not really seeing that the vast extent of these days at all so I am expecting this to be at the farming setup to use that up against Costa is a strong later and if you're expecting in or some sort of all in support to be paired alongside the cliff that makes sense asdenial to something like the threat she what you might expect you paired alongside it apart you could be a strong option here for Hui I do think it has been one of his best pixie has been really looking good on this then a has played it three times now to wins on the four already there is also more of an ability I think you just kind of bully out that Tom can cause you to have double range here and give it that to even go for him instead of canceling I think going after Senator just like almost always beautiful but at least you know I'm here for Zanesville again I really was expecting gang to be the son of Laertes played it once already this split I feel like he's going to bake that cake number to work in like eight games can you play with a second set of game here otherwise in Australia says Realty like the year for the blindwhat are the top laner Rumble is still available right now in back at the bands come through Rumble is still available for Hootie that's going to line up pretty well ready if you're leaving us up this late in the draft so we'll see what comes through as well so that Golden Gardens of course need their solos and with this set Flex kind of the same also available in a really strong pick for uni is dominated in the ALCS on it you did better in a cat reaction trouble but didn't pick up a win on his one Rumble game in the ALCS and you know what other things do with Santa that I do feel like you need it is it some sort of height adjusting TPS Champion right because if you're going to have a tank set which is most likely what we're going to see the time can't you just don't have a lot of DPS may not matter as much as golden Guardians don't go forward that you know any sort of Frontline here as as Barton and Italy Kandi Burruss down our necks and complicate things a little bitI really high DPS pairing with Santa may be kind of relaxed a little bit now it is Alice yesterday had a solid game but decent was the better team overall where is set going to the golden blue playing at the bank and Spence. Ignore the damage is it going to be grabbing you know when or Jana or a syndra or something else down here the Zoe is of course gone but what is it going to be at CVS you said it you want some more damage to help complement the fact that they're sending in the lineup and his beer with the first pick of the split for cold and flu but it would be consistentyeah I think it makes a lot of sense alongside this type of composition you don't have a lot here from Yu-Gi-Oh you are looking for a plank in our but there is no incredible go button on the side of e g I do think that depart ultimatum is more powerful in that regard. Coming over from Golden gar teeth brushing to Get N Go here so this is kind of feeling a bit of a throwback to words are early days where you know they were going more towards bush-style more towards 131 it does feel like they're kind of leaning towards that try to play towards Dragon stacking with your Calista a Bard Lane on top of the noodle used to Crave power farmer you're trying to get ahead in that regard and then send Echo out to the side light and see what we can get done there at 5 to see how effective that too because I do favor EGS rate of v e v I think sure-lite a bit I think that the execution is going to be very difficult for Champions like the echo life in Italy when you are going out for a team fightplay with Tom kench over on that other side and complicate things for the champion to want to dive in and 0 someone out of the Nar I think also makes quite a bit of sense I think it's actually a fairly strong match up into the Renekton you do have to be wary of all Lynn's you don't have to come out of Mega are actually exhausted you can potentially be in trouble there but it also suits back in the day when our was actually very very popular kind of guy who would go for like pee Dean are in these hardcore went against the bush Styles have a lot of option but very effective you can also build worth inviting a dentist give who need the ability to play pretty aggressively to push very aggressively in and still have the ability to escapealrighty well we are on the wrist Evil Geniuses can lock themselves in Upper bracket spot in the playoffs Golden Gardens tickets are best split ever with a win here today 10 and ate their first time ever going to possibly right at the end of the regularly scheduled games golden Guardians have been very hype this split come on Take Aim and people are ready to see the froster really really rounded out in the beat the lights of Cloud 9 they have taken down some decent names people are saying okay are Golden Gardens now at the real deal he zhi it it's been such a weird summer split for them they were the second-place finisher in summer they were the third star in Spring season third-place finisher in playoffs after 5 and 5 start with their old roster they signed they brought me in this group these five are only 2 and 4 is not his going to go in front of truck gold and blue here nice Health far lead a little bit of award and, and lands and damned if there was well spentit would have actually been a really big deal to get that third it both for the the path of prophet also is like she would have talked then right so that would have actually been pretty significant Health leave a comment back on the way out so we'll be pretty happy about that and it again so soon after after the games today and then find out know what is is leading to the sort of the change because they sound really see a lot of it so like you haven't seen it really at all in Pro but I think it's better but there was some very good players playing and myself so, and if people just like to stack up at 3 Health shrines at level one who give themselves essentially an extra health potion to the half about what it works out too or that laning phasebut it is actually you know that the resources being taxed more heavily from the golden Guardians bottom line Jews are the ones who had to actually use their potion instead of sitting on still posting a biscuit and has all his potion self are they did end up taking the worst end of that trade as the weather gets pushed into this Lane is going to be a partial free this got to look like the minions but I'll see. He's going to push it down keep the wave at equilibrium you can pretty easy job there Auto attack reset down three Siesta hoodie as the erline are pushing is going pretty well for him so far so good down there jungles keeping equal hunter gets know what power is done through did have all the rage but believe he was 1 hour away from Howard Hughes and get quite everything you wantedyeah you know I wasn't sure if he was trying to actually paid out the Hop there because you know any early levels that the Hop for Nars a fairly long cool down so if you can actually get him to use that without expending a lot of your abilities than you have potentially and Paul in window here in this position I'm surprised you did Lane I feel like you could have just waited it out. But maybe they're feeling like okay doodle is going to coming up here we don't have time to wait but there may have been before.you almost done who he was with it too far away from bank but he cute the Caster thing did not get stung though they're all just fine small CST to the garden spot Lane the more that you can trade the better for being else you want to Stack Souls get the Q Autos who he going to get an auto on a champion now no more souls they are but regardless it's a lot of pressure here inside in Spencer and showed in top they know there's no threat did you see your face. Bank but it goes right back to the Tomcats belly and gets back out almost the roots and it's going to take the van back up in a Biscuit they're obviously all of the Q healing gear from bang how you going to make things a little bit difficult there for the golden Guardians Lane but they were he can't be careful people have to get away and if I cannot find that killed but I killed a two-on-two time to walk away really nicely doneblade have been getting credit and rightfully so who is he has been so willing to trade as flash aggressively try to look for these types of plays I'm not looking very good as funny as it is sometimes any situations you can actually come up behind it doesn't seem like it is still going to in a push toward them now we'll have to see how it does end up in equilibrium out of here it's more time than that's why they can go for this play he hit the cue and then just flashing in get the ignite the auto rent comes through the crab First Look for their kalista I'm going to talk Die Trying To Die funi Here with this dream and play He Will Survive though and yep I haven't been back to base yet so that you're not that big a deal didn't even get his he's just going to be here as well as another safe but that was like a cyst on a little for jump Champion that I can be scary with the dragon hating you definitelyif you don't want it tonight early there and then risking of the Dragon of the date it was on the way over so you know not too bad they will just send it out to mid lane should be limping back fairly shortly but this is the correct way when you're actually cover you popped you can just walk mid you don't need to have both your soul in her up in the top link if you for that farm so they should both put up their wave and then you'll actually see them recall and swim But Wings back as well as soon as you get them learn for your own games and so that you actually go short on that coming through. So goes back topside they're going to get back to Myrtle Lane assignments or it's going to burn his pee pee to get topside to take his own recall grabs a piece of the last chance we can complete the People's Choice when he was able to recall outside so not the ideal power Spike but there's a job backthat is a very dead Champions right back out easily v y in Rome for the mate of stuff there they in for it they had seen is your midline they knew who needs and gold Loop both don't have teleport so at worst case it is actually you know that 43 set up for themselves and when you limit Echo stunt your guarantee to scale shots will hit from your teammates and Golden Gardens is having a great room they're putting a lot of pressure on to the Senate are you going to talk to the trade not much else to do you don't even really have a lot of control over when it's available for some damage resulting in the topside small farm deficit here for the Renekton gets really lose speed to help navigate to bhosle Ranch bash up his farm he had to be late game magic looks like down the line cuz you have seen already today top difference of matchup can when you again take that for sure we'll see if it does come to that obviously in a win who didn't have a lot of vision though the reason you think so respectfully is Renekton stun and sinitta least fear dead men are pretty much guaranteed so if you don't know we're closer is you have to play with respect to it that's one of the things that they that is so pickerel the Lord is good
