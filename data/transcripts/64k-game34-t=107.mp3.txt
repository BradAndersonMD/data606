16 years old back at the end of 2018 and the second you're able to have been really good since then I think is one of the all-time greats down the bottom Lane his lame it. As a player I will always give love and respect to the roster for the Curious world I am in love with this is exactly Gadget has been extremely flexible definitely targeting him here because he has played the midget on bottom side the Oriana as well I do think that despite feel playing these Mages and flexing around there for unicorns of Love which was his real standout Champion hard carrying with that combination at the we saw your note Witcher con can be threeengages four teams as well but it's so difficult to draft against unicorns of love because of the new variations that they still throw out here meanwhile we do have some more about the standard bands are the Aleutian solo Lane band taken away as well in the Silas popping up on top against them in the postseason very strong Champion their Oriana by the way is the primary Banda LCL teams put up a unicorn to love because that is actually a flex player there's an interview that Gadget came out to Swain's thing hey this seems really bad back line access or like really bad first so I can just simply play Swain antenna drain tank the entire he was Wyatt Oriana is one else because it goes between those two players drafted of course there's a way out there and only a few that can be bannedChampions the most played by far for Bob the top lights and white up there for touring as well and during definitely has been another one that people been looking at as a possible way to play again TRX so boss taking this stuff very early on means he will have a pretty strong Lane matchup for himself despite it being blind not a lot of great answers into Renekton here so your ex posting on their bottom side the gravity at vera for death in mediately and I even though there been so many champions played by carrier I have really liked him most on the long-range supports the Luxe the Morgana the enchanters for himself so trying to pair one of those with Ash to have a really strong Lane phase for the stuff I could be a pretty good angle to go for sports the mix as well and prosper them but we get to Italy coming through as the prime jungle tic-tac-toe the only other one kind of sitting out there as a as a top for jugular I would say in worldright now but nothing to grab them before the Braves still available for a nonstick jumbo could play here in a little bit suspect at times ever since they transitioned from ending on initiation jungles over to the current head of the carry junglers like going against Evelyn's you do want to have your heavy invade looking for trying to punish her early on as an anesthetic on on this Champion has definitely had some success. As well and see what they want to go with Iran V side answering me ask Jen pick up for Gadget does give you that long-range snare with spin be devastating when you have an Evelynn jungle for yourself you can set her up landfill charm charge for it though and or lava right now and Incredibly successful championturn the play in stage was band against solo at the end of the very first draft and now picked up here for door is not his most played he is really partial the fighters but it could go on for taking a win right here I like putting your maybe we could remember honestly I'm pressing the deaf task have plenty of teeth by damage output yeah I definitely think that you're actually be expecting some top side Focus here already considering the drafts make you play Ring box you're wanting to try and abused that door and pick of the orange but obviously orange is picked for the team value that you bring upgrading items big gold power spice Doors 2 level 14 and the team fight initiation irelia dropping out the table just trying to get rid of the pig Playmakers off a Cho be right there cuz of course I mean unless you really think orange sports going to happen inForever 21 games away from the midline or here now we need to support to be locked up it looks like down there and Pantheon what you're actually going to try and go to to kind of even out their profile here support Pantheon definitely super powerful huge amounts of crowd control Eric set up for drx4 possible picks for setting up this Natalie I've tried has tourmaline influence as well know where Joe V's most played champions in the summer split an onward of the lck playoff they are objectivewhat he played and I think through the pantheon ass and it says I'd personally don't like this one but Alistair they look really good going to be a lot better huge possibilities for team fights if you do you like in the Alistar obviously very well known for combos with Oriana with the Shockwave delivery you can w r to W N & D the icing off the the ball for so little sneaky place for himself as well I do think again though there still is going to be a decent amount of focused towards the top side of the map for unicorns heading into it and bottom side they're going to look at have it somewhere roaming possibilities from the pantheon now possibly yeah still can still can Flex the pantheon in the SEC if they really want to but I do expect it to be Fantastic Fourjungle make a different flop goes back and forth Del Pantheon jungle is very viable well show me right now looking at the cover on set midi played it five times already probably not moving around really big front like he was always going to build a theme second in the mid-to-late lck and higher so yes I think it's going to happen for him but it's a cough that is really built around depth being the only primary Terry meanwhile there are a lot of breath and depressed can get on Siri on the o l socket and I'm really sad actually now that they don't settle I remember they have to delete all ready for Juggle this solo laid come and get it there for theat the auto setting up with Ashley I was as well right cuz I don't think you want to get ink or set that much over all the clothes around them has been somewhat negative of a kind of narrowly. Into the lck finals and got that second seat if if people are expecting any one of those teams are named on the list of things that may falter down here but I think there's a very very good team I'm a big fan of the bot Lane in a big fan of govt as well and they made quarter-final taken down a bunch of stats on the way so I do want to see if unicorns of love kids live up to the reputation and turn a bunch of headsable to do the world's groups are games for this week so much about you know making it into the group stage of world but they don't just want to be here the reason they were so frustrated about not making it into the group stage last time around cuz of the damage that they can do it once they are here so now on the world stage here in the main event want to see them make it happen I've been definitely excited about the play in stage performances especially from Gadget down there on the bottom side of the map so we'll see if they can lock anyone up literally poke from the cross for the week I was going to come through in time we don't have any aggressive word and come across and no really big stabs there is a single Ward from Derek in the bottom River a very similar one from unicorns of love in the top River and that old spot if there's any vertical jungling going on or late invades in about 25 seconds on the clock right there you'll see if they're already in looks like no one's doing much of anything couple of things towards the bottling try brush T-Rex knowing that they should be afraid or not it looks like going to have a three month old ate a leash list topside start for p060 neither top Leonor Watling going to give away with the jungle has started Daft wanted to poke in this one in just crossed half as good because it means like can we were talking about in champ select of of heading towards the pantheon towards the pantheon support year because of the guarantees done whenever you have been digitally jungle you're looking for those point-and-click done to set up your ears that truly effective gay-lussac is going to do when it is full clearance here goes red up into frogs and we'll transition Down Sports at bottom side but look at Anonymous it already going down just move us to buff clear down to read to make sure he can secure these on Evelyn expecting some of those possible in DayZ coming from the Middle East because so much CC possibilities from both of mid and bottom Lanes I don't clear this no worries start on the gym this means they don't know for sure we're on a thick is however the Hotshot comes through reveals that has gone is gone and he's not on chickens or the Grump so he must be on front right now regardless and this is such a strong performance already coming out from Death in Korea who dies in the beginning of Summer they were extremely fond for TRX but they did start to fall off chords and you know Jeff has a back injury that they were talking about a lot so it's really nice to see that being a point of power for this team Edge CS Lee that they fully do unicorns bottom line under the tower trying to force them to miss sies continuous fighting over his ex revision and now I feel sick last out what a wreath on Comedown jumps 123 watlington a really hard time right now for you as well. This is definitely a kingdom here for Dragon X they want to leave Doran up on the top side without any sort of interaction sand for all of these by down onto the bottom half of the map continued renewal of the wards through the red quadrant of unicorns jungle as well will allow these Invaders from the osec continue to find purchase planning that spear was huge chunk and down it and not a second forcing them up into the top half the map where he's able to find the respawn on those fronts so they have a little bit of extra skinny jeans the mountains going to be roughly level 3 spawn of those so good XP and gold picked up right there but already a four to five hundred gold difference for DRX no big rig up in the cross just yet just reporting is items boss taking an early recall it's a good ass intro inflating bike to that one but you can see every single Lane all down the line you got leads for dear X in the early game unicorn so far not standing up and look at this is so lost right now or after the invasion not a lot of opportunities for him the last one remaining would be Jovi midlane but this is a ghost flash set double Mobility Summoner spells for himself to greatly increase the possibilities of navigating through these team fight I do think the extra attention to Mobility for that piece off of really really cute, and allows them know not to have to go for the face rash You're So Soft goes far and flashes not just yet The Flash in action free to use as the ghosts go for the initiation I want to know man then because he still has the flash it's a confidence to go for the chunk with his W setting up yo 6 to finish it flash burn their from Italy to find that kill as well and dragon X are rushing the early game Kingdom 4dx so far it's just across the board doing a whole lot better for three calls come through has a full fiendish codex for po sick you would love to see that recall on middle he is Rich with the rebs might vary as well not as thick as she still clearing his truck before his first back but this is rough stuff CC at the bottom light he's run faster betrayed right there is no man's back from him and now we can see it bought Lanes in the bottom corner that burned the flash out of Santa's you have a good night there from Carrie as well used in the edge
