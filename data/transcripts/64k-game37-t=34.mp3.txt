happened when wild room were literally attacking the DSM bottom turret mistake that need to be cleaned up but at that same time side trying to cover the orange so there's obviously a lot going into it I do think that flyquest was comfortable giving up the first two dragons but then to miss execution do that here to get sampling incredibly well around that third and fourth dragonfly Quest was not able to delay even a single one of those dragons to push back the soul to get into a more comfortable spot lose those fights it becomes incredibly hard zillion you just can't let it through we have seen Puritan dominating on it too many times and it also enable to place out if they want to go for so you got to take it away I'm going to be interested to see though they just get them people champagne all right side and be with you have offered van table just like I still give go for Caitlin and potentially get over GFwe have yet to see if so far this is worth considering it is a more valuable jungle doesn't mean he's the better than the overall or better 40th overall but like us are retaining this little e Fannin St Louis against because of not being in the first war fix the first 5 picks or identical to track bruising on through we know there's going to be some difference here is I'm excited to see if they do go to the ATF also enables the sort of place out that TSM wants to go for a focused on Top Lane folks on thighs Lane of course TF does not move to the states nearly as well as a cleaner in a very different ways trying to enable your top later by diving that toppling costly by attacking the side lane and putting them in a head so that they can then went through split push or that you can pull upmyquest make them spread out they are going to be playing even just with this core 3 you know they're looking for team flights that that's already predetermined here for the Pike West so apart and try to find pics try to pick off people into V1 that create opportunities utilizing this to you so do the band's changed around anything is 12 / text before it was before we see what else do you leave drop down on a course he had a ton of his ear game for the last couple of weeks. O b a t by damage of a bit also some extra engaged and with how wealthy is inflated round or & Oates in game one I wouldn't be sad to see board game 4 come out for players like for you we there's the three ways that will round out more Fighters that we may play top sites to set up there I wouldn't be surprised to seeplay this game for flyquest does it get to Mordor power Evil 2 best camps with Dory on a thing van out alongside that Sandra I think it would make a lot of sense you can go even for lethal Tempo and just try to poke out and push very heavily jacked I do like a lot you already have double Marksman hear The Counter Strike is going to be incredibly effective you also have to remember you quiet with the w you have to have that auto attack of the carriage ride properly on Jack to connect Eden Isle lot of that damage from coming through if this is that Pantheon is he brought it out in a couple of games did what he did play it three times but that being said as it gets locked in this is going to be supported I will be shocked if it goes power of evil it's going to make such a week or two weeks on that on that bottom side so this is something that is is very much got to pick a ball that you can actually answer in a fuse because if you're not actually slamming that lane you are not going to be able to all in Halen isnot one of the best all-in Marksman sure there's little combos like son into trap with the pantheon but it's a pretty tight timing and I do expect them to lose this duty to their going towards the has ear, as I expected so I think that can be a good answer not really killed at the F but just try to push constantly likely with lethal Tempo you get the prophecy PDF use that on the meetings to try to locked you up under the church and at very least you're trying to make sure that your team is losing any time you leave the line already well ignore support it's a bunch of trash and then the second most play the CrossFit games like us to place before they split in this time around going to be on the third wheel here and I'm sure it's going to look like now because I'm broken blade is on the Jack Plate it here and I'm glad we are still seeing this.right he's not on shine he's not doing redacted any hours I think you be dominant in laying sure but this is a join your team fights but my primary goal is in fact damage output this is a unique texture on the TSM topside yes really only TSM is the only thing left alive in playoffs who plays this kind of style play Can Fly Quest hold up against TSM because he said we're by far better and game once and we still got the same South come in for game 2 and are we going to have a spicy level one because both teams came in the game number one with pre-plant level ones they were the opposite side of the map so they did not actually run into each other so I'm going to be curious as to get this beautiful shot of summoner's Rift to find out if there will be any early game action this time around TSM camping out here just in case it's like what did go for any sort of a deep Ward but there's there's so much going on this game and actually really do want to talk about soit with this ignore pick it's very high risk because I think the thought process is essentially we need something to help answer the side lane play because we are going to have Broken Blade out inside Lane & Ikea folding over to kill them and they are then hoping I think that Pantheon can be out there and also over to try to match that my problem with this is that I don't see you winning that to be too unless you're already playing from an advantage it can be pretty difficult for a Pantheon from the time to really do anything at all to a Jack's especially no post one or two items so I am somewhat concerned that they have given up a lot of Leaning Tower here in that boat length movie to for something that I'm just not that confident is even going to help hold down the jacksthat wants to come through this one because honestly yeah that can be scary if you're not one of the lanes we already saw that teeth in did a great job at sneaking Drake's or just taking it off of Lane control hear the 212 right now is going to be initially pressure for the flak Westside that should make it really easy to attack into spam and knocked on the couch and look for a little too fly ignore and Val frosting and brush to make them both really hard to not going to back out respecting Diwali get you out of that one and goes back in as they fight for those ways yet again so we're going to play in the back side right now is not nearly as good as the trade the Jacks. Not even close you really have to be very careful because as soon as you get level 2 you're always going to level at least strike on Jackson you need to be out of range so you don't take a portrayed like that Broken Blade obviously did already showcased to Jax once in the playoffs this is kind of is that counterpick towards the board and it did work very well for him there I think this is a harbor match of two of you as far as the ones you want to gobut you still can't create big advantages in the side light you can get that point where you're destroying hours and in combination with a TF you really can threaten killed very very effectively I've also got to say that I am pretty surprised by the cleanse here from deadlift at feel like you're having a tremendous amount of respect over that point click Sun from the pantheon feeling like hey if that lands on me and 84 traffic cleared after that then you are get taken down but that's really the only thing there is to clients right like there's there's not a lot here that you're going to be worried about our son has Binaca from the journal and then flash but it's like either situations that don't really happen much so I am surprised by that you know I honestly think that it might have made more sense to just go with something or if you want play morphle and even the teleport in this kind of situation but we'll see if he gets out of it across several of the year as Jack made his way back to get coldhow to play the big light Force Base flashing York Senate think I was already on the road but you can see this is the power of ignoring course he was down there it's because you get a Rover on the map is going to need to pick up boots Studio 300 gold and he's going to try to effect the other lanes and they flash this was his face is laying you can certainly affect you can it's it's something that is pretty dangerous but until power Evil 6 I still don't really think they have that much right and left a dark that's up there because there is no CC you pretty much need the ability to actually scoop the TF back in so it's going to be a tighter time maybe then just like us would like and we'll see if there could be able to take advantage of that new Post 6 you're going to have to play a lot with water expected that is here because if you get shuffled in and a gray shows up your immune trouble at his.stroller that allows broken play to walk back out and he'll back up good Play There's Got The Flash by the way hot seat belt available speaker gave him the road out so well plate of the tourism Duo know someone is lost in that looks scary but the way they look pretty scary especially when you actually drop the war but then he got hit by the smokescreen you lose vision of your own words we couldn't have to that so you had to survive to get out of that smoke store and then hop over to the set with all of the charges available on that crafting potion he can heal right back up the wave is pushing towards them he has that early call so he knows he's not going to be able to just kill this morning not going to be able to really, dominant Lane as far as that funky one goes more about the farming it's more about how we can extend this board we got some damage down there is a car walks in mostly on the opposing the traps come down the products of goes down equal farm right now for the Players Once the has B+ a Castro alive means they can both get 45 on that point in time and we'll see you as the wayis answer this is the standard vs sword recall signing like I'm supposed to be traced back with solo and yeah you press the Dodge as soon as he's done channeling and be Bridal will time out by the time you're done dodging it but the way that she had a pretty bad spot and because so we'll have the advantage he probably has to back off and then TP back in to try to just reset the way his junk down Farm the wave is frozen Again Sam so fat she a pretty rough Lane position right now for Broken Blade and credits of solo is doing a great job in this one be one is up 14 C ask and we'll see how that although shake out after all the men do that cleared up but when you're drawing attention up on that top side and you're winning out anyway it's going to buy more time for your tongue go down the bottom sides with his black with him this time that grab that first dragon no chance of an immediate snowball this game from PSN deal here as well looking at how this had played out there's alternate reality where bjork's it is able to hold down a bot Lane right there as flyquest try to push the wave afterand suddenly you get the kill on Glenn's listen that becomes a whole situation but to walk over Drake and then still pushed away with way more than once already get a recall when they want it BS or boots plus the breaker. Felt very good stuff down here but now he is going to probably head topside solo is alone Fire Authority there goes Graycliff play v i o Frost absolutely beautiful knocking in right back in the waiting arms of the jacked everyone's backs off to give for his blood to the Jacks I guess what solo just TP back every top laner knows that is the nightmare situation when you die immediately after utilizing that tp5x the wave can be frozen on you or I could be fully reset your losing minions either way and your opponent is going to get that free recall off very very likely Sophieangry so happy about how that's how claim play shake out too late maybe so cheap is back in the wave is in a rough spot for him he eaten actually fully reset it he goes to drop the ward and already TSM is there waiting to charges on Culebra con frases behind so sad it's fine don't worry about I can get out of something and maybe I can still Escape I'll flash over the wall is here to come onwell off of the top side of the knife is Broken Blade gets up for this one ss just catching his farm down there will have a small CSF is it to his side and so far so good for the flyquest I was one but yep first what is relevant to ask him to feel pretty nice couple of seconds on the road going to the essence Reaver build its overall lower David borrero probably focus on that role sounds about right for the team composition how are Vehicles ready for him pretty closely with Bjergsen keep in mind you can about for extra gold per or Cs on Twisted Fate the math you say okay well right now from the TF passive the gold leaf outside of that is equaland it is going to be interesting to see how this game does play out because what was until you think know when you're out front line on the team looking for and who can take out that a sharrow becomes more difficult to use when you realize that while the orange probably could be stuck in the side Lemos the game actually answering the Jacks and there's no plans on any of the four of the other members and they're all squishy all of a sudden become so dangerous and turtles in trouble you can get more damage that's what they could have signaled a lot of them right there but it meansso when you go that CPR build any time he hits a narrow on anyone except the or who's probably not even going to be able to be group with the team of the time it's going to be incredibly dangerous to really build a teen and broken late getting solo dangerously low there he may have to just back it up even with since we're moving up towards that pops out of the map now speaker is spotted but
