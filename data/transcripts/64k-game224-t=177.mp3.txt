get the Champion's quest for in dates on the outside of playoffs but they can still make the third golden Guardians just recently lost one of these as well they're tough competition are falling down as well as CLG sitting pretty company in Fort Worth right now have their working room in and see if they can pick up all the way in here yeah be interesting to see a sealed you tries any funny business in this rap phase of the last time they played we actually got ruined play Midland Renekton a while. Wayne on Victor and they were able to win that game but that also was a irelia counter Pick and Pull Belton the plane that since they remove doubt or the chance of Ripon shows up for flyquest the counter pick for the Top Lane schedule the show early for ruin hereFort Bend Indiana Karma still available right now we'll see if that's the last final Banda Carmen he's got his Antics in a van right across probe Play Dispatch and it will be ribbon away so, I expect to see very early payoff in a graph big-time respect bands coming up from you guys with a lot of Thai present stuff not getting bad early on, would be the most likely to be pick since you can't what's around for play it Support also want to point out a weird Quirk about Pro play in terms of inertia so back in Hatch 911, would that about when red and 10% progress in Banff in may be the champion of Love admittedly got over by the it was a 10% increase on to a 10 Mana reduction on E and the big line was the one second at adoration on the E moviesBilly, goes up to 100% win rate went up 4% right up to 54 in Solo to the moon and back to 50 however because the proteins have thought about where, should fit in draft kind of realize that she is so good in either a sold in or support know she's flexible she's just like stuck in pronoun or 90% because she still good and had been for a while and by the way, can we stop playing this game as we have xayah and rakan already locked in here for my quest for the Wildwood of a deep convo very high price Spotlight to go to be up against it as well as the game ends up trying to put against it you may or may not be able to know where karma is going to finish on the final two pics frommyquest but a lot of stuff still open to painting a house making these guys want to go cuz you're Corky Keanu is something that P o e has been putting a lot of games into until a few still never know they're still not sure where that cam is going to be a top laner Sylvia's hair band come through my bet is just kind of guessing it toppling just just I feel like I see so many socara Suites about how to make caramel the best Champions Billiards colors my opinion forever fastest car that works for me paint Karma one-trick Baisley great player formerly known as kale box and it's time for the score of the Moon and she's going to be off the table you for this one as well as mentally stronger in this past and we getting a lot of advice before it's 680 the next one player time is second phase of bands just kind of go to nonessential can't use that is not the case with one of you is super highidentical hair very similar to be fair oh well quick Taco it's okay at 6 a.m. to read coaching here for video Six-Day War recover breathtaking is always as a couple to his fans come through but you never know yes if you don't really know what the, kind of pic would be most the time to just trying to help Scale app for sale games are going to decided in the early-mid game could potentially do it if I ever want to get into each other and Fries we see a lot less rise though because now you have to actually land a spell fluffy in order for your W-2 fruit with rest of Robeson LPL a couple of times low presents bit later but cool to see him out once in a while about finding a 9.14 as well and Corky to be logged in as be very highly prized bit later after the azir band and now it's like West to of course we're going to have their Top Lane be Karma after all d2 jungler pantoran Andres has been by far his most played Champions even though other countries are prioritizing Jarvis was wanting more of the fact that you won't even come through doesn't bother Sandstorm when you mentioned it is 5 by picked so far to split with 3 win 75% of 13 points Casio or rise up there in the top. Don't listen to watch for yeah I love watching pee on his slightly less present middle of his kind of throwback pics to me those are the Victor and the Oriana picture was banned didn't feel like Oriana with the right thing to play against Corky still unknown coming into the same how is vipers Top Lane, going to look how is Cassiopeia start taking Gage to hear ruins ride keep mine there's now a third rank of Realm Warf aquatic it's pretty short in the rain does not too bad so you can see some pretty big moves out of that champion and meanwhile is going to be the work on it would be leading charge of the black west side and wild turtle being a very large hairy black Westside to big back landmarks been there has been better as of late stepped up quite a bit here while Turtle has been completely stellar and I will see if I can push pain for its Blackness are a game-and-a-half out of playoff position right now with the wind there only one game behind with five games to play and they can't make their way in but it will be a very late surge CLG alone and forth right now after they couldn't keep their their lot of looking good but it seems possible they are poised to break 7-Eleven and make it back in the playoffs and looking for once again to come back and cash we 7 because I immediately get to say stuff like this is a must-win game which it is I think I think it's a must-win for flagrant if they go to 492 they probably don't make the playoffs and even though it's not a must-win for CLG it would do a lot to kind of curb the stress of their fans and probably biofrost by the way has been the guy who's been around for all these joints stop making class and a high level of success is on right it has been some rebuilding 4 cyl Jeep and I would need is actually surrounded but they don't know that if you re calling but now I can try to do is fine with W for 2 seconds things to buy a nice to score the right to call puts on those fans be moved anyway like just take the damn to Presby I was in a bad spot and you only got some selfies go to the useless with decent time to book the Civic you would never kill him which made him recall few seconds later so in the right place. Damage but he's actually know later to the leash in later to Lane as a result have you heard of mental Warfare free yeah I totally agree to it would have been better for you later. Bye Woody otherwise I feel like there that's the kind of walk around there we go. Is that right every skill shot. It's the way she has for wild turtle add another email to Megan we're good here yeah I quietly as well not a lot of quiet stuff like what she's been doing when we talked about wildturtle have the lowest at some bleach per game would he also has the best KD 8 in the league but you don't necessarily get those things just by being super super awesome as we see some trading happened in midlane would deed has a 13% Ford percentage that me to 13% of the waning phase above half way up in the link to 50% always pushing their current which will make it a little bit more limiting about what's my question do with the rest of the map as luck would have a look at where they are there under the zero deaths maybe not going to be more minions and there's a temporary CS bleed here for the CLG Cipher Auto there you go off and I feel fairly comfortable farmside should be all right here and we look around the rest of the map we had a temporary leave for pull out there pushing the first two waves I managed to get hundreds of Cs whereas we feel we lost four fan Toronto Raptors are gone away not going to fight this deal they are but also means a big loser full Camp ahead and is this going to be going to be answered by the telegraph going down to Saint torrent all the way to Scuttle crab it's going to be a full clear for santorin not so much 1/4 Wiggly depending on how passive this game ends up being that could be really beneficial for santorin watch how quickly does I feel like he's mainly just guarding against a possible Rex I think before we call if you're walking to try brush what's the recall down okay now you don't know for sure if he's waiting for our dive this or they can just always feel safe but it's always a chance you like more time it's always a smart to getting some rest before you recall just in case cuz you never know they could both be going for crossing the topside weekly would teach and turn on that Ward if you decide to go to something for him Flash recalling in fog of War near up play that could have been had rooms going to find a big roof ice dam Shield NW runs back out phase rush to the rise and what usually typed on a Viper in Atlantic you this much damage there yeah I'm going to end up paying decent man attention to Central Fish and Cheez-Its game but it will depend on whether or not someone actually gave to stop playing with the gang Karma Again part of the reason she was kind of turn back on the map back as he can't come back up get the chickens going back onto the project spend every highly efficient Farm path so far actually became for two heads w need to look like all of it all away gang someone was killing Crux and was Antoine let's talk about a year ago and Santorum was trying to get recognition for a coming back as a strong jungle one thing you did more than if you were always kill frogs and it's because santorin did the research and saw that crooks are worth double the experience of any other Camp so if you do nothing but clear cruggs compared to other camps much faster than anyone else so even though it's a difficult place to get on the map is there more than one else to watch the break the route gets back of the wrong warp stays alive the very long cool down but does not that game yeah so that will make the return gank if they have a number to damage so very good. Because he made actually died there if you got to drop off interrupted but ends up pretty flash will use that pressure created trying to trace topside so with no vision at all it's going to need to pick up there so you'll be pushing up with a side of the map they have not recall getting sick but he's still got top in Lake Zurich. He's going to recall by an item in the TV back in the lane by the Wonders absolutely that is the best drink to get early especially on stuff like Cassiopeia and different the Champions dead in order to get the wave priority have to kind of deplete their monitor with Essence Reaver first you often see on paper that hears you see on Cassiopeia lowers the blue box dependency on the mid lane really actually high-cost flash burn if you think about them burn the flash of rise in order to give up the ocean drink so I think he'll give me very happy about her for, to be the hard carry that you left a ribbon could be 120 people the back line but traffic is currently exert her will on a game that will keep tracking that over the course of time when it's acting as T are vipers getting some extra ability power early on for wave clear and eventual item completion technical lead for flyquest do it from farming you can see Farm leads in pretty much every single analyst small degrees here in the game going pretty low action but we'll see the warrior XII come in and probably try and make something happen at level six will be interesting to see how my quest functions with Viper on Carmen right rather than on Riven or Cannon her belly or something they can dive in and go and make that big play
