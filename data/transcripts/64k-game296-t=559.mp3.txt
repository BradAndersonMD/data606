North America's strongest Regional team and Cloud 9 North America's strongest international team and it's going to be a fun one so our end of Noah really Allowed no contest also by the way. Junger supposed to have been watching the international Leaves aatrox play three or four lanes galio place to buy Alienware thing in the van face can be moved to so many different Lane and that's where some of the power comes from but a lot also comes from the champion kids at this time I call it also taken out you'll notice that most of these are Solo laners the carpet there is primarily jungle actually for when the first times I have actually seen the highest percentage now for Carthage is as a junglermid laner or support or anything like that first week of the LCS GLS is free work on Earth that's why he's been there and that does leave for the most ban Champions on the patch open freak and that's pretty big 12 times and fro does not really his style Castillo expecting him to be the one piloting it and of course a lot of our power did come from damage increases in a p h e r Snell especially on the Q and The W Max coming in very powerful here we go though in trade for that the hover on Earth. Which has been very popular vote Maderastop playing right now I didn't really have too many bad matchups we have seen some people really the only thing you can try and go to to take advantage of Lane would be arranged in like beIN or however dinner. Still always has a possibility of helping out a jongleur and all waiting and using your ultimate for executed in that situation has been sometimes it can be hard if you're a little confused it is a bit I'll keep my nuts DP play some Victor bought back at Worlds we seen first plays Zoey in the bot Lane so far this season so I still want to leave at 1 as an opportunity as well as it's more for the course in vent play throughout the end of last year especially at World impact on a tank and you have the rest of those players go for the carries in all of League of Legends andwhat is the Premier Times Square in North America that we know and Ezreal I think the most premier bottom Liners in League of Legends debatable which one's overall stronger but both you to be happy in a PowerPoint into a poke so 15 concedes very effectively forgot on the front line I can disengage fairly well you know he liked a cation ultimate and then try and get himself out of there while it's Zoe and Ezreal fish for bubbles and follow-up burst damage turrets you can really gain a lot if you can play together earlier onshow me watch NAA and world this is new Ezreal sensible Championship the rework came out the old no longer lose his damage going through talking to his sleep the lanthian about 1 so you can get a lot of damage and deep in the back line if you land outright Target alright second round of Banff a this was more interesting because we do have some pee stinks send out make an appearance beer jungle are on the current patch right now because early game is so important that we are going to have to broadcast as well so they should be down at what they said you wanted it would be very high up here as well as a special offense Team Liquid but there are often still in the paramedic you don't have to play kind of that tankey roll you can go for the lead bands in the closet style favored more of the stage 1-e you know any of the game of the 2019 season so far what climate is like at Worlds with a Nocturne band but that Alistair is still us-59 still very much is Forward Motion team do this poker timer leader of the Zoe and Ezreal so bit of a new-look but still Forward Motion Hare Alice Through the only primary game so far on C9 zeyzal you know a guy that they would talk about a lot as far as his shotgun link and communication again another one of these Academy players at Cloud 9 have built on and brought up to the LTS level down I will see what he's going against here breakable you can block everything from Israel and Zoe try not to laugh your teammates and they actually take it but the unbreakable unbreakable of how long with is a really flashy North America I think this man is truly incredible and he's on a fighter for the early game, Cloud 9 side was going to round out that team with the best choice girls already Max blowers playing at there for some of the Misfits game and now they're already built around this Pope combination was do in Israel and execute from forgot stuff just adding a little bit more peel in the Frontline Plus early on I can be a fairly effective zoning tool as well but here we go it looks like it's going to be Cloud Nine with his poke coming up against these standard Team Liquid they've got power very apt in the mid lane plus illusion prom for the bottom I so you might think that it's missing on this lease in and have a lot of agency around the bottom half of the map Lucan and Broad Niche for you for trying to look for early combo kills because I can fact that stuff so quickly and with a mobile just very likely that might be some fireworks tell me a few new players on my final let's get ourselves into our very first game it was a 2019 already I'm loving these new intros break a personality coming out everyone else is trash that is the goal for double of fear the privity can remain the best player in North American Dad just another title maybe a world champion tip obabys Team Liquid and Jensen here squaring off against his replacement already looks like actually expenses walked right up to Spence Karen in the the jungle. Remember it well this is bro play where everybody's looking for these early Scuttle Ward Wheat Thins should have the option for which side he wants to go to a little bit of an edge over the new never lie I can hear the crowd already did to it but you knows where it is a bypass later on if they're lucky about this one and we will get us all some various spots leasing shut himself in the top so that you will be indeed getting leased onto is my buff on the bottom pedal map Nuna going to be released for Dead Zone red as well so the same busting taken on a map yeah it's specially important because you want to be able to transition to drugs or the Raptors very quickly new new to take the towels mid-year You Can level up yours to snowball second so that you can get that are we hit down and it starts raining bike back from all of those multi targets are Imo's on dancers Raptors should be able to finish that one up and then look for the Scuttle with a biggest things with you knew by the way since the rework yes you know it's this big flashy stove Ali rolls and is going to come down you know cleaners think of but for me it's a deal on his Cube the consumed you can now use it on Champions and especially if you take the resolve runes you get increase healing when your lower that thing can really based people later on in team fights if he stays the consumed not using it for damaged ceiling people off guard so be careful little bit but we got to see the Scuttle crab straight back and forth in the blue box looks like as well Cloud 9 invested in those two River Wards spotted at 50 minutes to split these camps yeah you can see during the administration are so sad Battle of the amount of force and trying to keep up with the waves we're here but it does talk Cassiopeia a decent amount of Mana Hurley on which over it gets wax burn wood refinishing the Lamborghini just in time to fight things stand up gets an octopus watch down it's pretty important we'll see you at the Newgate comes Nico card games overall for now that money was supposed to go to the church statement of town at a Smithy and let's see how well they can fight for this month clean pick up for him there just finished off with that Jim bass Amazin to go over there though so don't harm no foul still everything pretty much equal between these two teams have split the masked as you talked about going on when to Scuttle side pain while in the mid lane pretty much even as well and then she's been able to find a barrier for his next phrase I don't want to use any of its Mana into one of those sprays to be considered as much as possible for weight management there is one small difference here in the jungle far as I can see is that I took some of the jungle on a very very small level partially one can I watch out for Portland right now really good start for done with your update Siesta many ways is not 8 minutes bigger so they have the nice in the way from thinking basil down here alright Douglas volume to the train station Counter support taking damage that's when sneaking can Arcane shift in goes for the office about would like my insides and the snow was coming down bowling Nicky's on the chase here but Nikki might be able to go where God had just won the gate by on topside sup did not want to continue to chase into the enemy's territory but with the biggest snowball ever spend scared able to land at haunted impact where is liquid had burned the flash onesie one earlier and open up that possibility figure wondering about that dude is gay comes head up if your lender is able to flow The Flash by themselves obviously our got into Scion is our God Favored I get to use that range advantage and try and harass him early but licorice coming straight out of world's semi-finals for himself definitely a huge player for the scene flashes on impact gets thrown over shoulder and in fact there's no speaking ability left in Zion Chipmunks and flashes blown so allows for an easy snowballs Poulan turn on the Middle Lane right now put the control board on CC get spotted directly but sort of kind of is going to speak with the New Black old man either and just a black eye to round for the only the 172 spell push them away out of here Cloud Nine types of gold lead as well as the hell's lease space continuum svenskeren Now using this moment to go in heat warning up the blue side of the map I think it see what this Vision Taco he's going to use it feel to drop go to the flash in the pan treutlen that could have been huge but it's time
