and the hotfix that disables a selfie from being good and Sorrel Lane is in here so who needs billion top is not going to be nearly as viable I don't think the sea. But we are also had a bunch of frost and it's not support take Farm until you turn it over pretty cool but either way we'll see what happens to your kind of logic gaming and clutch are in a Champions no lushen know as real as real first band we're going to see the bottom Lane Frost Bank I doubt unless we have Maids down there that's going to try and do it nobody else really gets as much use out of that strategy following up with a style band Clutch Gaming do not want any part of the ultimate feeling so like that which is no not really a superpower pick all together I'mare they trying to run some stuff like billions are some old intensive championships because that is a big denial right there if you don't want to play yourself or with your other games but you also don't want to block yourself it's also a bit of a slightly quizzical band he certainly around there's been one Jays game from Hootie so far but you don't expect to see that so early in the band list you expect maybe in Phase 2 when you start seeing more to fix down but there will see what that actually mean for them is Alastair picked up the available he wants that you can play something really insano backline like a drink or something but they're going to play nurse Scion. Finally back in the champion today go Premier tank even after the nurse so again the nurse for a little bit of damage Nerf to his Q cooldown reduction for his W so it's a little bit longer to activate the W nowadays place is a bit worse still gets extremely Spanky and that's what she'll do you want they want that ultimate from Saintand they want their Sean to be very very Tanki Frontline night unkillable one more pic and weekly is going to grab that undefeated Tonkin for biofrost so I have them back up there and if you think he's going to say hey let's beat you into it what kind of picture you here in this first phase the draft date that will happen but I agree they are very obvious front ends in fields such as what happenednever going to be the first Marksman picked up here in this game was it to Premier one kind of eliminated its pros I don't feel really strongly either way I think you want to have those items that have to build the one to I would skip this deal until third but I think it's fairly close to being them certainly that should damage is nice but if it is CDR 840 G3 really do like them at a return on Silver standing out every wave spamming out boomerang bladeCalvin Harris blame as well don't get that one wrong so that we can move around and this is a very very standard setup you want the busiest Freightliner in the game now they've got a team bike carrier Infinity Edge I still do like the runaan's style secondary for her and that's usually enough to get a reset and destroy the rest of the team fight yeah I would definitely have to have striven hurricane built in the build ship got bust in the update and it is only efficient and and very very high damage hurricane of course it's obviously both are great choices and and I think they're closed very very goodLacey Riverbend by means there's a possibility of power of people playing as 240 style bit later and them playing mainly around hyper carry against the rumble I feel that like that is a little bit more difficult because even if you talk to eats up the Jinx like that removes your team damage basically for for that duration and it's absolutely get-out-of-jail-free card I really do like what Clutch or put it together as well even though it's killed Jesus focus on super standard Frontline Plus the speed plus the AOE damage that could be very powerful for the early game Boulder Junction right here then we'll play hide and seek with youdo its picks a pick me up all of their really are aware that fix a has been their primary carry of course they're still a pic for Pua out there ready to go in the middle and we'll do the secretary might come through in the Middle Lane Wiki Waki nearby the way a lot of people super happy to get back on the court you train with the options of crystals coming through againtorqeedo does have a little bit of an issue with some assassin's rifling through a few options here we did see a dead earlier in a European LED no kassadin both recent Nerf armor Nerf black with a passive they can just leave the backlight trying to do if I was at least said I would for sure, kill power weed out early in this gay bi as an 80 jungler whenever I see a cat that it is so easy now those are some of the skews the lowlanders where I buy yes I can solo kill him with my warrior you're probably die and this is fun Clutch Gaming and counter logic gaming both just passed a game behind flyquest in third those these teams who really got sort of Shake It Up in the offseason keep my eyes peeled you miss playoffs the first time in Ord history switch to run a couple of players brought in their Academy jungler brought in Tower of evil and now they are poised to be tied for through with the wind right here such gaming lost most of their roster but they're only after a very disappointing summer split with famous play officer toys to have a winning record themselves alright this one's definitely means a lot or the middle of the standing here who's going to differentiate themselves to pack that's the back camera let's get ourselves in the game Clutch Gaming versus kind of logic gaming game 5 of the day all right let's be pretty standard openings from everybody now it's if you are looking to put out some early fresher all the mid lane which I think that Lira should should do I mean it's basically bottom triangle of the map usually has the jungler you look at the boats opposition's early on in the game and you can decide on which side you're going to favor heavily this one I think for Leroy act as a lot of options you know cuz you're talking about the rumble who needs Bison play aggressively we also know that who needs verse acceptable gangster at least has been for the last year so that's driving you to the top side but then again Shield use wind conditions are on the bottom triangle of the map + you want to kill this accident before his level six and it is very easy to do that as a as a leaf in super mobile does a lot damage to him so I'm very curious lyrics stop process as he goes through this game and this is one of those ones we have so many options piglet the minigun is on and he's out there and he's very very low health regen and so pick up the same as you're going to stick on him he's not even got Fleet footwork so it will take some time to get to help backup not that I think it's time to kill Lane is getting demolished in the health and Mana here if I miss laying with both of the early Boomerang Blade prop Ross going to trade as well in line right here but looks like he has dibs on which ones I first went off pretty good here comes the train I feel like she was as happy as we were about the trade Lira we talked about his objects Creak in this example I'm here look listen to the tribe Russian came down for coz they didn't see it coming. Nevermind nevermind alright now I can safely finish this even though you see me cuz I got to go drop that thing you do about it there's another look at you doing it all along he was baiting let's fix a get very good trades on him before he goes in Flash with Alistar easily Secours this one consider is that bottom land burned three Summers on the side of Clutch Gaming CLG recognize that they were dead in this situation they did not use any of their own Summoners there's a possibility of recourse here for the bottom lane or theology if they decide to have weekly finish up is frogs and then head to the bottom side of punish those who lack of Summer's Bells the power he will now getting the truck down about 1/2 HP Sauce to teleport if you need this to get back in later on down for CS is the first couple of waves coming through but The Runaways number 5 right now and I mean to almost perfect for Matt Demonte you be able to take the key with his own so trying to hold on to you before is his more eclectic champion pool I feel like he plays a lot of things other people don't doesn't always work but I really do love that he tries and I love these are very good I don't think I think it's always a chance in Pro play and so anyone who brings one out there for the first time in like a good I like this I like variety so your point on at least you tried I mean that is there at 1 I thought really could have work I threw through think there is still can work but that's one of the ones that you're talking about right outfits with a Chance nobody else had tried to play it has been very clear week is this in a picture into a car so I could exploit those very clear weaknesses or 1/2 minutes of course keep in mind darshan is on Scion throw a level 4 teleport and gets knocked down just a little six. Tulane you have pretty good up time on the farm but and there is him pushing towards the Adaptive Helm that read you be looking to eventually trying to grab as many or at least as you can escaping or teleport as long as you can and then using at first they get back and not miss any experience disco one-hit your level six that then you got to get back to your late round trip gas station, miss a day pass at a better one another with a double Summoners hero Advantage could easily go see Oggi's way we want spend enough to set up at first so that one's going to land pictures of damage to your house when you go to be careful what's going on we want to do I'm driving when you're in a one-v-one like that position yourself slightly inside the enemy model so when you're flagging away you're not just running away you also get the doc up there on your way out to the possibility of any Chase in your queue damages in case it anyway so decent stuff here but we have a game with a 900 Gold Leaf to clutch really on top in a Box locations of this Midtown 20cs as well so seal Jeff is right by the fact that they found a lot of losing lanes and Lyra going to go right into the dragon over this Photograph because they're punishing mid-length so and everleigh and bottom light push and you can see the Jinx not moving because of the Minion movies are going to come for it they're going to try really ocean Drake to come out here comes the sun go back. Does not allowed to burn seals you have a walk away and Hootie at TPC sucked anyway maybe I'm wrong I'm sorry I couldn't get her to fill in your shoes made with you big everybody's trying to do that call now that I know right back into the jungle pick up his Red Bluff and I guess everybody is definitely to secure that because weekly is going in for at least the steel I mean you can say hey both will try and head what about or whatever but I'll fight song lyrics
