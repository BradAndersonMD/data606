I am outside if you need more than that and it came up here on the red side they have been fairly competitive day one game against Invictus gaming close but never able to close it out as Katie it's their first game of the day maybe they're cold as much as he wanted to from day one and it's a chance to be to strike and need to get that first we will definitely want to see the pdb Invictus gaming stop being afraid to dive Gracie's play the letter that does start with sole Norflex biggest rise at a rally all right with the first two off the bat hear a collie still very much available tell me what's on the playlist titled What's the fastest bike ride in Baker had so many rides game team is very comfortable on it being taken out by both sidesthis episode of Game what might be left open I wouldn't be once on the family decide to go and yeah curious to see what looks what was that bottle and ends up looking like so far the trademark Ezreal still up for Teddy's play that three times more than any other championed is usually think about you but you can handle this or his his most favorable champions of the year of dealing with one fell off the table fan out the last of those main flexible text again returning to the jungler discussion that we've been having here includes Improvement in that last one really controlling thing for SK Telecom early that was kind of you know the entire name of the game for this generation of SKT that got rebuilt Texan taking one nap when it comes to a little bit more but I like them both on skp in the LPL support band every other bottle cleaner available any kind of a kind of match of your availability if they want to attack tattoo on to directly playing potentially expect in this scenario bottomland for SK Telecom this will allow me to spend his time in the top triangle of the map you kind of ping pong between Top Lane and mid-length really getting advantages for those do I have to say though for me for the farm who Buffalo their bottom land has been the standout area of the team for this tournament big coral and palate have both been quite it's so many of their game on the bottom rack on a dentist a status about lions happening so it seems like the action is set up and I do want to ask you how is at least game against ID 83501 upset time and again it is coming in here I think played pretty well overall big picture on the main stage here for pbms and he has another one of those eight 2nd round picks in town if you're going to have to make one on each side almost certainly but given to the night nature of the job that's a lot of black stuff inside not available excited to see what I come to see McAllen for example the most viable blind picked up later band away and whittling down on the top Lane Champions. And Sarah us know two guys that have played in the top 1 have been talked up so heavily from both of their region at different time but seemingly have had a bit of a stumble on your kind of getting more and more the Champions push down and down and down stairs like top 7 CHAMPVA are already up and out across the nine Stolen Dance across this point already so you are as you mentioned really down to the bottom of your pool calming Lane Prescott really like the combination of Elise & LeBlanc it's super phone if you can get any sort of early Advantage they can both said each other up with traffic to cancel a block in the leblancs text to roam around that can be terrifying sounds pretty good Comfort your foreknowledge third most played of the Year hectoring Freight into a truck is conspicuously one of the top one is left and it's probably back in line for 02 years so I do Similac what is Katie has pins and I might not see the farm of his ear maybe the form of Corky on a great lake game in both regards here four fingers and faces Mega + 10 to 15 CSD so far in the middle and he should be able to survive there a pretty common pick into the old block for scaling Lake a payment on the side of PBB they might be going late game side push and they do go for the Fiora and this particular match-up in the last two patches around the world in playoffs versus Khan and Khan definitely early but I'm at shop that's who she's going to be looking at is going to be like in happy Indie and I do like the match up most of Akron schools that could happen play a difficult but on land we know there's a great player top winner for numerous in Vietnam he's been very good I think as well as when a player overall in the music and I know for the 585 meanwhile Fiora is always best part in a side length doesn't help you killing today to carry I guess Hey Dad I really do like Fiora into a hacker 04 FIFA PVP only thing I really on watching out for possible jumper jungle gangster because they will have the advantage in that all I'm with the extra damage that comes through but once if you are starting to get some levels if he comes so good in that side lamp and the heck am I going to have to play with the team welcome to summoner's Rift our fourth game of the day skate Telecom T1 Beach Champions out of South Korea a Regents that you expect a year-over-year to bring the best teams in too big of Legends in 2018 was not that and now the part of 2019 a stumble in game one but the ability to bounce back they've got two more games today including that shut down within Victor's later on as Katie could immediately jump back up to the top banga Buffalo of course their last minute leg on home soil for the first win both teams are to have a lot of overlap and that's what I love about to go to bed at League of Legends when you can read what he wants to do is win condition that can be so topsy-turvy the game right here the actual early traits helped zeros a lot HP plus trade itself is better so we can pushing clip back taking you against another plus five help so very early games later on he can indeed 1 V 2 cases both of them out of the top side of the river, is going to recall and refill it supposed to track because we've already talked about how a Champion Select with a deer Lanes me Nashville Tom against Iraq on our expectation is the play around those lenses to prioritize and topside popping is what we do expect an a plane from LAX and recs I at least thought I'd just potentially throw a wrench in that depending on what she wants to do with the future cat easy least go to both these player that does put them in complete saga Board of Lee and he starts were actually spotted whatsoever is and they both is going to bottom side right away it's red the drugs in the one but red down the blue the other than my feet of the schedule for Chowan meanwhile on the top side here is Derrick Rose going for the Strays once again with con when the difficulty for the heck room here is that it's so hard to avoid giving those sweets by his 206 with the early levels doesn't have any way of avoiding it and he's pretty much the sum total of how much damage you can do toiling around like a helicopter that's where his threat ranges but that's the only time you enter that as a field is the title of the overtime you end up winning the war of attrition as a field electric company leaves near the jungle pathing will get her close to 3 but not quite Fair The Ward Houston looks like we're going to get that first division the bottom side takes bottoms cuddling up with a reason to annihilate struggles is because of scuttle crab if usually not after picking up drugs and dust about this doesn't have a thought struck clear can me and she gets into some awkward spot but this time we're going to go up to the top side right through the mid Visionaries do e-zine but on the topside serous go very close to Cara could be available and of course wreck site nearby as well as I did walk over toward they do know Rex I have stopped River but it means a horse recover from saliva Suite B2 is a seminar off otherwise it escaped out of PVC yeah you can see at least they're trying to hold the cocoon for the Tom Kent Tompkins using the flash Barry early then he changed his Target and they the Devourer out as well the critical Summit of burn is Mata that flash War Tom kench not available for repeat Focus snow devour to remove them so given that interaction body in the trunk and makes a lot of sense actually in quite a spot for PV beef after the game as well leave there were extra minion so they can try and Fries here against the Azrael Azrael long-range can try to throw these Mystic drive but getting very very good for Big Goron pallet down here and severely stacking up the SLP sex that much issue these farm so far pretty much equal has become so far into this be at least able to pick up the dress as well so jungler not for the topside they force their releases are the Couture went down but you see how much the way I the minion that take the advantage how far is my only claim comes away unscathed hey this is ours that PSA I was talking about earlier papasmithy to poisoning stuff you don't have to worry about early is the ignite true damage for the all-in from an Acura a Big C, there goes the small vital in addition to the potion Chucky there's enough to keep their Us Alive long enough it so they are going to secure the first place but at least already is Rafael and RT Flash Forward to finish that do clit can answer for the do for us so much for a glaze on the microtex of doubt we already know the Corinthians about managing their minion waves normally not in the PVP, but looks like it works pretty well for them here as well as a 1,000 gold Lee now for SKT watch was burned 3 minutes ago is most the way back up now and if there is no further punishment on that first tank was all for naught as we did against Eclipse if you can't find a half away in that jungle matchup pushing it toward death Katie here very easily itemized the ninja tabi again the very Early Trades a very comfortable for him and now we're done for the Shadows available ngacapruk 120 away with their live with the health part of these goes to the Korean fancy moves but also the Summoner spell Advantage very big for the Korean all these bottomland Summoners were blown in that exchange clits then able to retreat to the dragon in here we'll go such a long way in helping out this way and I think it will be given to Corky and asriel all going to be spamming that spells get Lane control around 7 Minutes around 10 minutes one on the way you're going to text me or iced tea look for Lane Swap and potential of for Rift Herald and topped are damaged and try to keep the fee or down when the truck is not there is a counter effective on Boxer and especially since in addition to its ocean Drake the early kill on top
