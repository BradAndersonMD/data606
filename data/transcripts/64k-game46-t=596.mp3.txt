here for both of these two teams and I do think it's interesting because we have this Revenge match right because we have a lower bracket and I am just so interested what are the adaptations that TSM has made of the analyst desk with the triple golden Guardians prediction, but I think that you can get them does have ways to win this series right if it if we saw the golden Guardians are going to go to the same route with her fully targeting beards in with their trying to get winning to be Tuesday to me the obvious adjustment had to be TSM fix your support champion pool try to put yourself in a position to be able to punish the blind work on it because that is what Golden Gardens was going to time and time again there triple Banning beards in here already yes you can call some of those black bands for the pop but really this is kind of all folks that beer can the far so that it's the same as it was last time around I'm going to be so interested to see if it is okay for Morgana this sort of style and if so what is TSM Panther in game number one because I do feel like bowel Crossing double this month's play at a higher level than doubled since replay last time around PSwant to chat well there's the Caitlin first pick there's the ass answer and now TSM how are you going to win your support matchup are you in the ass lyrics Nonpoint are you blind and support are you waiting till 3rd pick how do you make sure the two on two goes well because TSM with biofrost pens to win length either without biofrost and lose weight at the I knew he also tend to women almost every time so Grace picked up please send likely to be the answer will see what else is locked in so I do prefer to say to your support pick 2/3 here there is no support pig locked in unless you assume that it's going to be in Oceanport which I think is incredibly unlikely I do think this is going to be 10 top so there's not going to be necessarily parody in the pics I do think itsm could go for Morgana now and then been out some of the answers to that if they wanted to go for that sort of Route if they feel like that is our pick you up so can match than top and then try to ban out some of those 4th for have to he would go to a or even say if you know fifth pick counterpick going to be going top almost guaranteed against theNBC licorice play yesterday I do think it is a good answer and finally we're seeing more than just GP as an answer and thanks I tend to think that Cassio and Vlad both suit very very well alongside a d jungler they're strong massive into tanks the scale very well alongside them so I think it's an intelligent answer but of course Shen the concern is always what is he going to do outside of the lane not necessarily in that lane in a watch how this place out because how you got a flat Amir yeah you're thinking this isn't straight don't get me wrong but if you ever do good you know worn down you got to see CJ and Izabela Baer spend to kill you so you want to make sure broke a bacon free far but then in the mid-to-late game really be that that carries North I went back and watched Nikki's co-stream of some of these games as well that's the last time you seen her in that you want for the match up at the Caitlin Tool & Qs through the mini way of that also hit ask if you don't do that you should befind a little bit so it's closed at least according to him at the very least if it's an undisturbed bot Lane that is an advantage to double up the bathroom system matchup and I do tend to think that it's you know can be slightly favorite towards Ash in a base on the eve of hitting Vale versus the bills were Peacemaker generally think of that supports have a bigger effect right so if there is a big support mismatch all the sudden that's kind of out the window and lo and behold five bands for the beards in 12 or 15 of those Guardians bands did go towards beer tent in the last series so make it easy meaning of 20 now our bands against Derrickson over the course of these four games he's going to attend or anyway what guess what they did it pushin forward this I think it's obvious open Bic that clearly golden Guardians would have been worth I think Echo makes sense as an answer to Ward's it is considered you know what kind of a counter picks so to speak in the early Lane Paisa can be a little bit tough against the Sandra and that delivers range Advantage, but if you can play this match of aggressiveespecially post sex you can really come out on top and then you're playing alongside the Shen do you have the potential to go into 131 the other pencil to group up and really after their and Lux support this is something that has been missing from the ALCS Championship you know playoffs here or is it support pick I think it's incredibly strong and I think that looks does have a pretty heavy Advantage even against the car, Ash have very good push but what Caitlin is something that is really popular elsewhere in the world and locked it it's really really strong it in solo queue as well so despite the fact that it is believed that the last pic deer for bow Frost and he has the support counter so to speak I do think that they got the word that end of the support back up again just because the golden Guardian kind of flick did the math here anyway I will these are banned out you know what are you have is an answer it doesn't feel like they have the best one that being said it's it's still a lot closer I think as far as the bot Lane matchup than what we saw in all three games in the previous seriesis exciting I'm always a huge fan of teams that do a bunch of dress present come out with exciting pics it's Golden Garden to Demonte don't worry bring out the echo it's a good pick you old the old and you're going to be really happy on the other side may be the single strongest support in League of Legends right now is Lux yes this is still 10:16 these small Shield nurse are not in on this patch she's still very good in 1017 probably still take a Poulan Pro play as well but luck has an absurdly absurdly good picked out the bottom light to go ahead and answer with Karma you're so that you wouldn't like 8% lower than mine like we're good here this is is they Swagger Champion overall I really like the golden Guardians draft I think this is very intelligent of them I don't think he's them was like you know into their draft either I know that was like a lot of the criticism that TSM got the first time around was it felt like they were never really able to move the ship pools around this wasn't a solid to you some better ways have concerns forwhat time is having no because you have relatively low and Gage against it a team that wants a full Bush right and so went when you're in these types of situations you generally become incredibly depended upon winning or laning phase because then the way that you win the game is by being ahead so that you can go to the objective and 4th Airborne to come to respond and then you killed them are you take the dragon or the bear to whatever that's generally how this has to be played out a sheet gauge is not enough right you know tree candy right to get these light Amir flags and stuff we don't have to go buttons on the TSM side so I think that is going to be the concern for them against the team that wants to spread the map that wants to split push them to death do with this Echo Shannon and they also have you no more ways to start a fight with Echo going in with the stand United in these types of things I bought two maybe looking for some sort of wrap around or or invade maybe just going to camp in this brush and see if anyone came forward to actually go for a little bit of a wart ignition because sometimes people will just move in it and look for that way into workall right well they're going to try for it I am wore the fantasy dry stuff not going to happen though it does mean that if there was any kind of invaded by Golden Gardens no one's there to meet it or the word comes down from closer into the recall for the sweeper same exact play for who he soap those supports both junglers playing forward control over all sweepers early on only rewarded trinkets for either team at this point it looks like there won't be any big invasions and will be a very very standard jungle start on both sides so what I really want to track about this is bottom Lane TV to is Ken TSM get the bush because I tend to think that again Caitlin wachs you must maintain the push or it becomes nearly impossible to really get anything done in this and we'll see if you want to actually get select UNF third is I thought you're really big deal start things off but busy the reason it's so important physically in this matchup is really getting punished is because if you allow the Caitlin wachs to push you in what they will do as they will set up a trap line on one side of the turret and then theydrop the lucky on the other side of the turret and it makes it nearly impossible to actually step forward and farm as the Marksman player without getting poked so you must maintain the bushes at Shear alongside the karma you throw the vale to hit not only the minions but the enemy Champions to get photos taxi from lethal Tempo make sure the biofrost is using the cues to help push as well because if you can keep them walked in under their turrets so much easier to deal with this crap to deal with a lot of stuff because you don't have to take our kind of making the lanes smaller for you which makes it so much easier for your phone to say those killed us to see the intent on how to play the length of intercourse on both sides as well Lux in you know if you're playing her well is actually defensive support you're going Guardian your maximum Shield you are doing your very best to guarantee that nothing ever dies and I can work well against protocol in because you don't want to face shielding on there as well as other one exhaust in case there that Vladimir dive and it needs that yeah he's going to he's going to wait he's going to scale he's going to get a feeds going to be finewe really really trying to push in the early few ways I got to see a dependent if that a Health Advantage or its door and she'll in the post story used by FBI this is the kind of lame TSM and in Dublin want and it happened exactly you know this is all about that butcher and speak out of the top of them the Bucks ask him in the face in speaker put them in the ground that was such poor timing so unlucky therefore Demonte speaker with the perfect sense to be in the right spot right time does have a splash and flashy flash that jumps over bump transfer complete thanks for the cast of Honey thank you very much 300 more goal on the board with how long it took him I wonder if your couldn't have moved you know like originally looked like he was if I die yeah cuz it's looking like okay he's just do this but look at it over the wall itself you're just doing this situation for Flash show from Demonte I think he's going to have to do without the dad on you and you know it at this point like this is actually just a really nice play because they had a bit of a push pain at top side so flat Amir has first moved in what they keep its back in with those phone cards in a little pity home guards therefore it for dying curly on in lane and he's just going to get right in on top of them but because he took so I can walk it over yeah maybe it's kind of the we could have saved in there but that's a really hard call to make right you don't want your name to be doomed off of that back and walk over and then back into tonight milk maybe only have two spells and then yeah he finally came out of the area and it was too late so dumb right now to to 400 based on rounding in which can't slow down 7 CST for doubles down to the bottom line on the top side so far so good. But do you say I'm doing just fine. They're letting faces are going well the only 10:30 thing for CSM is it is of course the help us what the kills on to jamonte you know I talked about the only the only part of this set the generally feels really tough unless you just get slammed as Echo is the early Lane face that where you're going to get an auto attack down and white spotted so closer has nothing here undetected will see if they can actually get on top golf Austin or so if you actually get us done on him into a fighting he's just going to die translate finding me that to go get side that's rough for CSM because they weren't such a good spot look how low are over for Golden Gardens so if they actually didn't get that gag to build them out they would have had to base with the wave potentially Frozen on them which would have given the TFM bottom Lane incredible Advantage so in the to be to get them doing great but clothes are the one who really disrupt that it and turns it around let them get that good FaceTiming off and now this Lane will be much more comfortable than it was for the golden Guardians at the very least we can punish is Diwali in pink with to camp at the polar bear can't gain XP he won't grab either or is he looks around and missing things he's like yeah sorry about that you missed awards has gone he knows where the phrase was it's going to be a recall on the top side but hey double and kabocha can't believe he's going to be looking for you happy as far as the jungle one he want and then it just before it becomes known which is going to be more effective which has more of an impact there now they're moving down towards his Dragon to have control over Midland they had to push their and after that kill over and bottom Lane they have would have pushed you there so we'll see if they're going to the one to make the first move closer is spotted over by that dragon with find out if if the attempt to regain the bush year in the bottom line to V2 I want me to swing back and forth and if you can drop down we'll see if the Drake ever does get attacked right now is it effective control Wars will eventually be swept but right now if I was holding that one mid push-ups help him have Lane control for a while but those have been timed out the last bit with the Relic Shield in that means the squad comes down and go brush for who he is if we were built have a lot of stealing and shielding you can she still deal damage does a 10% how thank you more if you look really bad kind of killed him off with its getting a lunch deal then you can't break that anymore so it's nothing said about the day he was going to just get to stop mate back and forth a lot here oh my God is running low on how to get out barely skirting out of that set at 100% I would have been pretty scared about that actually Landing cuz that look like is his little pinky toe is still inside the Sun and we'll see if they can appear with it. That was going to be a death penalty out it's not going to hurt that badly but looks away from them it's going to be so it actually is pretty bad because that's going to stack on his side and look at the trouble with love and generally speaking when I see this in for
