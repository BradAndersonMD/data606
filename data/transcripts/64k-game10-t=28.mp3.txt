not sure about the validity what are tournament is so early in the year and we're already getting this type of adaptation I mean if we would have stopped it at anything or earlier it look like hundred thieves steam roller to dominating Cloud 9 but game after game here in the last do Cloud9 have fought back if persevered and now it's time to lay it on the line that will go back to more Moonstone Champions William scaling to heal 4505 later or will they try to do some more poke duels the the play regardless of whether it was supportive Champs hard carry Champs has been great so they know they can rely on the bottom Lane already Small Change here to Leah given up in exchange for the Renekton band denying that one from someday they don't want nobody to have to go into that againimmediately the exact same draft for these two teams I'm curious how long it's going to go because like yeah we want Jack to me last time no problem will change the lock with all the way down instead of instalocking the sets and moving it in the mid lines are going to grab Trail right off the bat of this is the chant they want for who he and he has received zero Vans aside from Pantheon and none of his way you like how I beat Cloud Nine all right I want to see it the Affiliates is still available as well picking up a 10 for palaver he doesn't have any support right now usually we see it with you on some sort of speed boost in his own right b t and since he does have crowd control on his team that can also be viewed as support you know set up for the possible plays but I personally attest picking router and a Jack's play the shamisen season 1 it's snowingbecause every part of your kid is auto Attack Base and guess what Counter-Strike the gates at all it's going through Dodge DF get through so that's definitely one Champion that hundred these can rely on and will cause a thorn in the side of Cloud 9 and you're seeing the bands come through with Sven on Santa is really scary that man put that he looks much the whole bunch of respect this is outstanding after practice player has a lot nicer Persona is outstanding get alongside real cuz you couldn't deliver the routes done so to get rid of Twisted Fate so like you can choose your all into it if you are keepingJack of the Twisted Fate and you can go with the rail like your talk that is great Synergy because you can easily physician the magnetic stud but it also has the defense of property is if you're keeping track of the Rocket Jump as well as your ultimate both very good night Miss Fortune again then presented as can we play it really really well I was huge fan of how strong that Lincoln be if I would be a fan of Sigma food come out for we know his set up we'll see what comes through though as how did he have a galio option if they want to pick so instead I think what 425 games has some kind of teleportation bought his ultimate I guess haha was the one where it looks pretty good and feignobviously yes it does not also have the teleport you have abilities so you at Jack's and Rise 131 with the Lea as your Crocs in the middle being able to wall people opting a little kick people off of being able to try and answer the Twisted Fate probated will do free let's get it with the r l you can also have a lot of combination plays you can position the attract repel done very easily as well but it's also good for knocking back and tumbling away from you dear the thing you have to worry about is very clearly going to be the Camille galio combination the Twisted bottom laid all those are going bottomland parties of everybody coming down is going to be very difficult here for FBIwell then it's going to be a fun one to watch for this is going to be exciting over all 16 games so far of vein in top readings is 50/50 there as well the galio comes in around out the composite fair enough really well so far this seriously couple games he's played the champion it's all coming out of it's all coming out again five hundred thieves have certainly been still playing the same so aggressive style yeah I mean this is going to be the decisive game of for the series it's also going to be the decisive game for vein pray and pro play currently cuz it's going to tip the scales either above or below the 50% let's get it it's going to be two very different play styles for these two teams as well obviously we talked about the 131 set up here they're going to try and split the map for the Jacks for the risemake those plays without getting caught by all of the global Twisted Fate berxer he had a great game last game on Twisted Fate for cloud nine they're going to need another one from here alright FBI using the game plan of don't buy your ticket as live bait in the comes automatically it's really optimal gameplay the close the page anyway so you cannot be true you start a different cool that I didn't buy it because it would go down when you bought the item has been gone for a while though so whatever you can say to click applying for cardless just something you know like play around like I would always let me check it out first before I bought poking through a door into they want on my way just in case in your muscle memory now I second word yet and now it's actually there's no game plan all alright well it's the switching of trinkets gameplay once again dropping your defensive word then switching over to your sweeper by the way again highly recommend this for you dear especially because you can just do your full power clear before your Scuttle Scuttle crab even Spas so it's really nice to have your sweeper ready to go earlier can just make plays right after the first clear use your flash very aggressively to light flashes blue flashes on on your enemies or even be able to chase them down so she does have the phase rest and you just have to get to them and land those Autos first delayed invade is not seen yet active late they don't know yet but I doubt they don't want to knock down the top side Ward and gave fudge and perks the XP so they can get level 2 off of the first wave so really, it's up there but because of that hundred things are going well that's your player on the bottom side and puss take a whole bunch of cats down right now right this is a pretty solid been pretty bad for the FBI support as well and now you can close our side jungle and protein and more has been takes a big hits as well. Who he's very slow that's going to hurt a fair bit play sit perfectly Vulcans in danger he will stay alive a lot was going on there really care about but either way it is one of these plan better the Box you want to board the word is going to see him still ask the flash by goodness of anus set up freaking this is it the dream scenario now there are no Summoner spells for either a t carry on the bottom half of the map and blabber because of the opening doesn't have a lot of territory to work with eyes are going over with his small camps being taken away just going to have to finish up on his own world he's going to be behind expect more focus on the bottom side of the map what a great engage right there VIA Rail stunt still a logo off after spin classes cuz he was able to Crockett so they close enough to walk them and they followed up there by FBI no hesitation and they get the first Blood where's a good job I had a fuse to grab this one that we have no we don't have time there's a fight in the top side down fudge has to jump a way he will go away from this game cool about closer what's he showed going to left jungle a what in the Midlands that I don't think I blew it's too late what's this is incredible this game is just too hectic I want to write honestly we are looking for punishes on bottom side I did not expect it to be at the tier 2 turrets what flavor goes hard flat surface from him and Vulcan since there's no Subs on FBI and hey you got the first blood but look at your CS buddy that is able to get another Minion wave in he's going to finish this one off plus the Cannon as well and get off the recall yep Waverly clearance event of a man that doesn't matter though he's got to get a really nice to recall this one pretty much almost over money or at least the components of should feel fairly comfortable in for FBI stunt double longsword so yeah pick up there talk it's pushed you can see with not a lot of interaction Sunday is very far ahead topside yet again yeah ants and it again it is blabber starting on his top quadrant of the map to so we already talked about all the trades in last game where you hook me up with you two can't get your auto off to a Counterstrike you're not going to park your own adaptive shield and you're at your trade is fruit but no blabber starting red clearing towards the bottom as well and then showing twice both mid and bottom means that he was also operating under the assumption that he has some days going to try and take advantage as much as he can because they've got a lot of info on his junglers position to start me to Monta going pretty well or even if I'm out of that one they usually stacked this one obviously Hitman itself with the dentist at 4 right so you can kind of make up for the lack of a pea under the door and rang and it's not a problem by letting you see is very clear Tennessee athlete or so is a whale gets in Dallas and claimed by Zeno taught watch a shoot so yeah I feel pretty comfortable on the Cloud 9 Scion defeat those still playing towards their arguably biggest win condition that is still the side lane Jack do you still very scary and fudge he is down two levels right now this is horrible to do with gets level 5 without the ultimate you're still not that safe against to die but because of bladder is there they have to call off the dogs I can't go for much more so at least get to catch up in a farm back yeah I can't do anything without Flash to Tulia but it also creates a stalemate because actually I can't go for the dive so if I was just showing themselves to stare down there just after walk away but provides fudge the ability to clean up the much-needed Minton way that is dollar because that is going to get painful quickly Twisted Fate level six. I'll do 4 perks let's see if they can actually set it up again towards the bottom side still no flash for FBI but he does have the cleanse available unless he used it in the last little engagement so I think you should at least still have that still the setup is going to be very scary especially since blabber is transitioning over to bottom half but so is closer cuz it's here who he does have a flat fee needs a w comes in can not quite get the flip back to go down at work as soon as he had sex you have to have that on your mind who he and closer will do their best to clean this up but the damage is done to mate goes down in the aftermath as well off to the dragon to start stacking I'll correct us to 2414 Vulcan did losing his life for that play but very much so that you type in all chat because those are a couple of Great Kills and again okay Twisted Fate ultimate will get popped in mediately they're already transitioning down towards the bottom half will live more action photos of phlash away from Sunday Vulcan will not have the damage he's not going to go either as soon as he is almost within the realm of possibility for a galio even if he is support but some days till healing back up he's got a bat scepter no more plays down there fudge those still lose because they have to walk back Elaine yeah that's a bad sign if some day is already able to fight his way out of a hex Tac Toe tomade him set up gang at the galio came over and fudge has to run himself a wave barely escaping with now a flash discrepancy we co there's a pain on the Vulcan so it must have been spotted in his tricky play you can see on the mini-map he's just hovering up there in a fresh but a blue thing went down here for a hundred thieves you know what yeah I think he would have been seen going through those brushes anyway and now he's like okay I'm show is fine no place whatever clear the way about Cloud 9 a lot of control tops I was actually went over there they're going to start on the rift Herald here as well lot of protein. One they'd already claimed the dragon from the earlier play so C9 that'll be up in Gold they're up in farming in a lot of these lions are going to get a lot of global tracking to be stacking Harold to me to tell Rick kill before too long it would just be able Top Lane but I can't wait for a second there something going around got some in a dangerous spot they know that this is definitely his weak-side doesn't have any business snooping around trying to get experience or gold out of the side of the map because they already as soon as they say they saw walking sticking around on that word since closer in
