star-studded Squad yes you can say hey some of this is the Champions he's taking a lot of Champions in action here I'm excited to see how he developed as a player he does seem to have been of that Killer Instinct he's not afraid to go aggressive try to make things happen sometimes it has bit him in the butt in some of their losses but overall I think he is been a really impressive player and I had a lot of fun watching him throughout his and you're in the elsya have a lot of fun to do it again key or Bortles of course are on the outside of class looking in right now the playoff bar is 5 wins Immortal do not have it would have the easiest remaining schedule in the LCS it's honestly one expected to be as well and visit us in Evil Geniuswhen's put Immortals can still catch CLG they can stay ahead of the guitar second look for winds like this I want to see if they can make that pussy if it's possible we had a long talk yesterday saying look I'm glad of an LCS player again I want to be a playoff play with you to make that would happen next and pick up right away in June as an excuse. See a lot of Iowa right now in the lead in the ALCS. And I'm pretty confident about that we can get confirmation but I'm from the first one we have got to see something that is definitely not as much as some of these other pics but I really want to see what the pairing is going to be if they have something specific in mind Jaco known for his thrash known for as Morgana maybe they want to go something like that type of Route you could even go get more of an aggressive option than being out the Morgana which is been paired very frequently with the Caitlin but double Marksman and syndra picked up here for hundreds of used as you said you know theyeasier to schedule remaining but they have lost for their last five games so they need to shape up and need to be playing clean down the stretch if they want to maintain their playoff position because they are just one game ahead of a mortal's right now they're on the cusp there too so if you drop this game Immortals has the ability to move up in time with you and be happy gonna to be a hundred thieves codes weeknight is Team Liquid flyquest who are arguably the two hottest teams in the league right now at least two of the three hottest so if you're going to win if you're going to get to five. These are your best chance to do so and that would be a team that you are you know been fighting gave me a tiebreaker or such poor as well so if Mortals if you're going to do it you're probably doing it today insanity is on damage yet again his third Zoe game of the split the set an alarm in 50 into the fair even about talk about down there as well so only a possibility alarms getting the girl got respect then coming through stuffyeah I am going to expect this to be Top Lane set but it could be us on it it is getting more popular is a pretty tough matchup that being said we do see some junglers feeling comfortable to just try to play it offensively just expected I can't say I was expecting the voice crack band who has not brought it out yet we have situationally seen it but it can be difficult for Jen to deal with because Jen does not have any way to dodge out on it but fruit pretty interesting I think it's for spices for pick because I'm confused with a draft order right of the day guy is just not that surprising or special either so bored I get right but yeah. I'm not sure if you needed it for thatlet's hear they are with with some occasions for all that they certainly have really slow but it's anyway maybe something you can certainly get another tank down there in the import regardless so yeah we're still looking at zero takes two peas and support tanks Alistair or Leona aren't that tank it's also possible they could put the setup stop playing for a Laura mango something in a little bit higher damage in the jungle from a really wanted us there are ways to get more damage in the composition you also could you know how vire damaged top liner to match up here at your work is actually pretty good into Gangplank I'm not sure if we'll see it Allure Amanda Morrison General have been one of the teams in the past that have been willing to try something more out there pick some kind of crazier things it could be awkward trolling us a bit with this hover Sion will come out so I meanyou have a decent early Ladyface you're not expected to dominate the GP though and then Sunday is such a strong player that he should be able to have a relatively free Lane I do think that their opposition here is very low on damaged you have heavy amounts of Cece and there are squishy members so she can get to those squishy members you have the ability to lock them down and bursting out in a with with some of the damage here no warmth we have some signs of the path you can do things like Titanic Hydra or sometimes even stairs get a little bit more damage in there so there is some options as long as far as that goes but I feel like when you play these has the cops if you do not absolutely nail you're engaged you are going to get kind of doubt you were going to get slammed because you're back line will not be able to keep up with their back line and your tanks are going to be kind of caught in this middle is worth like a phase rest in a phase Rush Graves GP is is hitting Barrel chains on your tanks and your front line is just getting slammed so it's all on the engage in that case they have to have the purpleturn off the great novel is all coming across the locking down those members and then if you can lock down that grows lockdown that's injury could burst them out and try to win that fight all right take one is a bit small for a hundred things that got a gang flick of the topping for Sunday and Immortals get the first gen of the LCS splitted means marks against a line Bingo because Zoe got picked today so congratulations bark you got another Point here as we got some CeCe in the bottle let him is just going to recall any way like you're patting the stats and nothing is really getting games here. Like you're getting spell peace on Earth but you know what I'll take spoke with you can get it and I actually disagree with you a little bit what they do yet is they push him back and then they can walk in safely Vision right if mom catches is high on health then I do think there's a little bit more risk to actually walking in on this in Fade Out some cash. Have a pretty strong level one so I think there's a little bit there but I agree overall it's it's not going to amount to much and they didn't end up being even dropping any Awards this yearBrendan so it doesn't matter though you don't know because I got removed for years ago the like little vision that happens if you drop a war that you have an animation you can tell when someone were to brush that's gone so I probably could have pretended to Ward and Smith he's going to go ahead and knock this thing down give the last it to Insanity they're going to share XP alarm I believe out of range of that one but on the Scion statistically very very good matchup into Gangplank has a really I went right in that matchup overall nothing from Wayne County for the game cuz to work out well for you so we'll see if that comes through at some point but if it's important you actually do have pretty good time in the early phase that you have the ability to actually push the GP you have to be really careful by the passage UPS on level 1 start from Laura much are not sure if that is almost to be honest with you I don't really play a lot of Zion myself but going w e doesn't have any ability to fight back and he's actually just getting dude on cooldown plus the trial by fire is very dangerousdevil to Smite fight gear potentially Immortal is roaming office it was a hundred fuse bottom Lane and it's Andy's coming down to it's enough to keep you safe so very interesting jungle pathing contracts going to read the enemy blue Drake write his own blue is there in time to defend it that's I mean very adamant that it happened this way end of the day contract code for the risk and it's not rewarded and this is actually the Flash and someday we'll break his shield and he's got to be careful that second barely hit them alarms at 200 house already flashlight that someday is Relentless in that link alarm only has two Cs and we have to go that way but the way it didn't look like it was very good for a hot-air and you can't really base not too far if you could be the way it is absolutely screws pushing away from he has gotten a fair bit of Health back but I mean if your Sunday you just hold this wave let it come to you you don't need to do anything aggressive he has traveled far is sonow you got the three Cs and you don't know where Graves is here in Gray's in your try for us because they all leave one of three CS at least afford a refillable potion all right and a control board for the Braves game he is comparison a fine nothing could possibly go better hear true Viking use for power Spike late is great now and I'm honestly so maybe there was some texture them's not heard any with the w but it's such a long cool down it at level one and you can't really fight back and then like I guess it's a process if you use it to absorb some folk but it's a shield breaks you can't actually pop it for a turn damage so I feel like the Q is just better but I don't know maybe I'm missing something in some 10 million Master Point Zion can let me know exactly what the fuk brought us here is either way somebody play feeling very well you did really good use of the trial by fire passes at 3image burn constantly. That every time he did actually kill the barrel off every Stitch or passive and he is much more difficult or I'm going to leave early learning phase goes for GP tomorrow put these going to get that Gene and towards the Triforce reach can't pressure him anymore okay to head down to the bottom of the Mack you going to go through and look at that and it's not about to go through the body no fold forward Cody sun it's a flash down no gang it also seems like he said he wasn't going for the gank right as soon as the super saw the work he started killing the war and how cool is flashing forward if you're going to actually go for that flashing gate I feel like she needs to be continuing to move forward so that if there is that the power from Tom kench you can actually clapping back in slowing down chilling like find some sort of ability to catch up then it just seemed like there was not on the same page. I'm just as well you ain't heard me but I don't really have to care about this one he's chucked a potion of Isis Farm is fine he's got more minutes to kill for the Post reports if you wants it to an end of the day does Caitlin is having a nice easy time here in is Laney face firming up nicely but now that you won't respond to it yet again contract and Dick Smith you can keep doing that around his mother anger comes in but again to save them can you describe a better on that happened to honorhealth on Dorsett is pushed all the way out of the river all the way out of the Jungle has no help build up right now he has his feelings might there's no way you're going to actually win that fight against Rays who had the challenging Smite which is so much better for the dueling plus just the ability to pay you out shrimp Rock the phase Rush on butts with quick draw crazy able to create that space and now we'll just be able to start off this Dragon probably going to need some help though is that you can take quite a bit of damage doing this by yourself but for a heel and have a honey fruit but I'm fairly low going to finally walk over to have a chance to go get her to shut the way things used to be safe today contracted to damage these feeling good about picking the early aggressor in the don't go back to take the dueling lead and feels good as Santa to get the same as in a Roma mid lane. Close but small Leach Wyoming overall in the early game as Top Lane is still double CS 5226 stop playing is Boom so I don't think he's feeling really good about their chances in this game has been such a big wind condition 450 used in early so go someday so goes Hunter to use it often feels like he is really good at snowballing advantages and actually making that count big time so we will see what they want to do as far as a playing this they don't have really any engage that's one of the things kind of working against other thieves so it's it's not as though they can just like set up bought it and die very easily with beauty also I do think that the idea here is just going to be trying to Play 4 winning Lanes try to snowball through Jack is in a force your opponents to come to you at those usual ejected do you have to drag and things like that and that is how a hundred things are going to find their fights where they can then try to cut it out and then slowly kill off of Mortals in a bit low on man has a straight back and forth with them day has as well as could have backed by alarms cute weights around Macon Xpress W Inn Express q and get the occasional CS barrel change. Looking to land there you can see 60 ACS now highest-end is feel bad for alarm take him imagines he wanted to getting outplayed it so far and I think he picked it more for their cough rather than the match up in a sign and I don't think he's making sound but either way it went really bad for him and they're cheating by coming in here very early and you're not expecting to be able to come up here and there in the early levels but some day has been able to win the trade season of the get the farm. A great lie here does have ultimate so be careful but it could be a fight here as CIA as well but now he has to worry about open back with it will flash of a lot of stay alive from day does The Rustic 3lc all line up the grab the killed Pac West Runaway he's going to care for a while ago said summer he'll keep that man safe enough that is hundred thieves on the four for the kill the first break but at least the herald lunch was missing that was really well done but after the GPS
