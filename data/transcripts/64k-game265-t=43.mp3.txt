when's title after title and we are the champions du Lac D liquid shows read the emerged with a recent success of Team Liquid smithy's starter the point-and-click CC the point-and-click CC denial slaps up if your TL I think you just trying to run back basically the same draft but yes NM could be saying the same thing there it is Tomcat the band makes a lot of sense that has been enabling double of so much in these last two games where he has been a monster leaves of the Kindred use before commonly known as a side pick soccer is picture you can go Kendra zillion as an answer to thatwill more points be put on this Barracks both theme succeeding with that as their bottom Lane Cary galio returning as the first pic though does half the globe does have cost for the double knocked I don't think they have to protect Alessandra Jensen does not traditionally much of Alessandra player he doesn't really prefer that champion as much but I still think I may have an opportunity to grab it in their next couple pics and unit Fiel does go for that is Justin Blythe picking lysandra into York Senate has given him the option to deal with thatwell all liquids wins have been on the back does Varys and Tom kench one of those has been denied a very still up if you think it's probably in consideration to be graphed right here start or actually hovers early on with every other jungler available they want the impale a lot of their picks have come off the back of Xfinity finding me as hell but also good at clearing good with the fires around the neutral object if you're going for that has given them quite a lot of security and I think it dition leave your sin and Broken Blade have both been putting a huge priority on Champions who rely on Mobility for their success when you're looking at a rally would you look at that collie look at all these sorts of Champions just say no then the very least okay well Zoe was Victorious for Pearson early on the hybrid Vigor didn't look too good right now and find a counteraction do you take those verus to make sure you got that I think they can just go zillion again it ain't nobody makes a lot of sense but there's a lot of areas that you could go for instead we'll be putting that pressure on himself game 5 it is hemp versus beer to the he has the counter pick and wants to Black this lame of this counterpick is all about tank setup and we'll be able to choose the initiation on to Zoe but they don't have a lot of coordination here to pull this off driving to move sibert now removed as well as wait to see what exactly Devil's going to play nose against Ezreal plus galliano's Brom is on his teeth loosen trauma certainly someone that can be there if you ever does step up did you get that super late when you have a lot of items in the Krypt Marksman are scaling up so we'll see if doublelist Alexa's go back to the Sarah 60s m going to leave it up once more reason not to as it had a lot of success busbar the only real question there is enough playing fairest without the Tomcat right because maybe he wants to make a move back to a champion that has more Mobility like the Lucian he was not the test was the first two games when he didn't have that safe GSM not showing any dive right now give it to me LCS finals Betty goes with a Kaiser that is going to add a lot of extra damage and also be able to assist in kind of diving back you know if you hit a starter ultimate onto the dead girl all of a sudden finish off that pic was DXM stay true to what they found Success With broken plate on an independent Champion for the top side and big questions about what we will do. The answer is a collie will he go to yet another carry with a lot of these people and Carries already fanned out has gone to GP is gone is gone will he go back to a very curious to see where the direction will be going with full Comfort year for all of their players impact would be huge I do think you're 10 actually answer collie quite well but you do have to be careful about Futsal is that okay or will be the option the team by 40 L will be brutal later on in the game but there a half to get there first as you certainly think a lot of these Lanes there is ability to recognize to do and pack them in and have a big early yeah I mean Brooke had such a big game for TSM on Vladimir not impact and turn the tables and run it back on them simply has a lot of back line access Team Liquid team play their coordination with teleports as what brought them here brought us here the game number 5 and if it were the last words from the coaches the last guidance they get it's now down to attend the players on stage their instincts their preparation their training and how well they can do now when the pressure is on the trophy on the line the title in St Louis bands before the championship number 6 for Pearson and doublelift score JJ the spring split MVP use on Prime now impact pushed to a bladder that carries so hard from his opposite member broken played his first time in North America on another carry this time the akali and smoothie he lost his games cracked under the pressure now is the time to show up and prove that you were the best team in North America are you purchase liquid what is the final game for the ALCS championship can ask for more than this from these two teams who have played their hearts out already both teams showing really strong performances and the tide has shifted in this last games to Ward's TL but 10 TSM Riku can they bounce back and kind of reset their mental after too rough can use both teams settling on what works for them so far Team Liquid back to this Garner TSM back with your ex I Azrael Zoe just the fact of scrutiny was spamming taunt actually gives me some some faith in his mental that he's not so television on the game that you still feels a bit loose and the Third Estate you need to be in to play at your best pressure of course is going to be a word tossed around a lot when talking about this series Team Liquid poised to win 3 straight not just games but LCS titles DSM so few teams that you Stave off the reverse sweep they got to do it here if they can do it if TSM can win this Championship this year they will have more championships than all other LCS teams combined and they will answered all questions the bracket the day of the go through they had to beat the ruling five-game series now Going the Distance your against TL certainly all questions will have been answered the Middle Lane is clear the way perfect PS4 Jensen it's always a good sign when you're back there call First Take play sleep and chain at the same time apparently even trade in the heel is still available because how to use against no we without being level 3 she can't steal it back and trade the damage so much if done before she can hit you back with it and again LeBlanc always looks for the gang set up in this matchup with Zoey can go Distortion with the chains allow and started to close that distance not usually a champion that can have an early impact Katie and knows this on the wreck side circling around using the passive transfer onex50 opens up on the Raptors and the junglers see each other for the first time this game with out of work pants a little bit of gold and if it's meth who takes and retains control of his side of the jungle 13216 overall jungle CS meanwhile bottom Lane doublelift is gone with the cleanse on caixa this time around he does not have court jha on the top 10 sport of our extra Summoner here for later on in the game so it will mean TP Advantage for TSM right they have that barks and with the teleporter 10 answer Side Lane Blaze double if not going to have that luxury is it from Valley of way too threatening and even that sleep from Zoey 10 mean certain death if you don't have a cleanse available or someone to block it was on the track a later on if I'm at please don't matter and it comes down to do you fight someone extra combat Summoner that you mention if it is Matt slays than TP can mean a lot more will wait to see that one play out supposed game of course the early laning phase impact wish to Vladimir here got his Pickens Broken Blade so far farming off of very small death of Vladimir but nothing to write home about just yet middle an advantage to Jensen that counterpick working out quite well Grace afraid here from Broken Blade that's fine the extra damage early on impact is trying to see us and he'll back up off the minions Billy took the first record of the Jungle of course with Predator you want Foods ASAP and I will die and they will stay pretty close and far too pretty good at Power clear now that they've increased the range of the spires can even do the crugs no effort required now that everything has been cleared back out onto the map trying to get the Jeepers Vision he gets award over the back of the wall by the topside broken play finding another trade also really worth taking into account that isn't ocean first dragon right so that is assuming this is very very big I think on the minds of both these two teams if you can take that that is eliminating a lot of the threat of this poking unaware down from others. Garner is definitely a champion capable of soloing the Dragon first Predator is activated for xmithie looking towards the bottom side but smoothie and Sven back off as the minion wave moves up good communication and caution here in game number 5 no mistakes will be allowed here you're the Alice has talked to the fact that game 5 would probably be slow or how I brought it up is the pressure mounts and you know what mistake might cost you the entire season it's so much on the line but at the same time in those situations sometimes it is the first time I had the confidence to go aggressive the confidence to make that play that can decide the game right if you sit back too much if you always get the opportunity to be that playmaker to your opponent then certainly they can't make good on it and there are so many players here in the series that are going to be able to look for those sorts of plays the guys who have the confidence to do it Broken Blade certainly one of them constantly looking for those opportunities Katie and himself going for the invasion jobs at Ward has Moscato out he goes first recall comes in To Kill a gem plus the dark seal a potion to stay in and CD are the required how do you want to see Acadian still in keeping that faith in himself yes they did have a rough couple last two games but he has had the success he has had by playing aggressive by being in the face of his phone has been trying to stop that you have TP Advantage they're going to use as real teepee to come over here has got a robe over as well so he has the inside first couch with the bubble this is Ocean trade super Leon goes to TSM that is very large taking the first play for themselves that guy sitting back as hell TSM are out of their seats if you try to commit to that fight fully broken play too busy being in behind you and you could get wiped so they had to give that respect over to him exactly in the last game teleports on display through route this time around GSM making use of their advantage early on really being a far better player in Ocean Drake is just absurd for Lenny face here and put mana on Sandy keep going for that can you poke a walk this one away but I just hold down and I did also have his magic damage Shield Brock there from the room so that is another little cost do that trade in broken plate does the
