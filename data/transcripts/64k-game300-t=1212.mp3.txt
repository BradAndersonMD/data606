he's because of course there has an iconic one already this year billion is one of the first Champions at Cloud 9 use to dig themselves out of Penn State play in the North American LCS summer split on cloud nine of deathly made one thing clear ever since I believe this bird game all that play in spinal they have been Tom Kent on blue side and right side every game they don't miss a trick with out here and Holly on blue side as well if 11 Tom catch bands in a row for cloud nine will see if I can can use on throughout the series has I'm really not surprised I want any of the event as well as healing and Nocturne Choice band against Cloud9 preferred Place Allen Jenkins Rd best mid laner is allowed for licorice expect Liquors to hold on to it even though traditionally very flexible between the mid lane almost always gone to licorice for Cloud 9even when they played when it comes to Kane and you think of or afreeca freecs depending on which route they go if they go the poppy having that standard tank for the front line trying to play front to back but as you say they very well could go for some more punishing One V one to try and win the splitcamping up in that top LinkedIn job if you locked in for Spence Karen and Clyde I have to decide if you want some other high-priority camping thaisa and xayah two big ones up there we know what is it worth me taking up table that could be an event for freaking II band face pull up Fords metal for a while, center field something like an iPhone Gauntlet there is always an outside chance to go for a big bow for a very late depending on the only drawback for afreeca freecs is that they're single game freak was messing with the tank that Scion was probably their worst game I the word performance brumskine himself so maybe they will divert from this route second round of band face will come in and the Marksman has not been match this is huge because he's dumped more band into sneakywho has struggled in the group stage as far as the laning phase does go in the first round afreeca freecs of one of those games go along based on how they played so far this tournament Cloud 9 might what does late-game insurance thing okay if it's a very low kill farming early game showing up with a 3 item play stuff you feel pretty good but one of the big things about going to happen to Midland hear you're seeing if we can panaway some of the blind myths that could be safe like rise in front of set up with the kind of pic would be with their daily event for Midland Country bands come through we could also go over the possible counter that Mr Jamie wants to the frog out the unbreakable shield from Braum's as a very good job at denying some of the big play making from Braga to can pop the ultimate in the air to stop that Big D Fightin PhilsI need a hotel right now with the galio and lysandra bands that beset if it looks like for me so just curl blind it first seeing the fans come through and then make actually Jensen a react to your not just played it recently adopted into on this Lane as well already sorry I was so vintage Rock tiger showing up on the world with a lane dominant 80 Gary big for sneaky himself from and loosen plastic and possibly go for thoseearly and that LeBlanc is being harbored here so despite the fact that we have had to be robot landmarks been sanded as diverse as Lucien in the bottom Lane and that is a setting of the Jungle the little flash of the leblancs are made in the top sides could absolutely outrageous a chocolate and harass him come on here on this team we wondered about that as expected the Earth already coming out very important how their bottom weight does do if Kramer Factor than to become much more difficult and going to freak her lie about what you're bringing in Keene and liquor is coming in through remember that the coaching staff of Africa change this year as well quintessential 5th Place team, giant step for the dropping coach off the Korean national they both joined and the results of pocket picked our fix imagine and rage was really mad if this is going to be exciting for Victor as I'm going through this matchup in my head once it's special you get the speed boost off of your cute but you're not going to start out with that early game we will have juggler attention up there would be outside I can actually deal with this wild card cuz you need to be ready for things like this in this festive five well here we are on do summoner's Rift City Last Hope of South Korea versus The Only Hope of North America as a freaking freak of the last remaining South Korean team near the world championship Cloud 9 episode 5 of 6 quarter-final verse for na since 2012 and let's see what can come through here as we get ourselves back on to summoner's Rift for the first batch of the day insane Innovation here especially on the Africa side like you mentioned klepto trades with a Q order going to be the big thing for pain usually when you take cash then you drop weight so you're going to stack that something you're perfect acai I say a group can actually be fantastic Wayfair in and of themselves also in the early game here LeBlanc and definitely her ass Captain Cassian and gained so much power as the magic goes on and closer to that level six see about the early game here because it is double AP Soul winners with an AP jungler as one of the things I was cautioned against here with Kramer needing to find success otherwise he's so Lanes of Cloud 9 can just build early magic resist protect them from both are leaning upon it as well as the Enemy jungler by think afreeca definitely ready for that they've got that as part of the planning starting bottom side here for Spirit on the gragas might actually go topside to protect this Victor early which kind of expected was the only opening that thought I might try and take and to meet us at cautionary tale of we can think of okay to get the speed boats that you tried to come and see sounds perfect very very capable Top Lane champion and Xin Zhao has that Target ability to close the distant no ghost power down but I'm late Ward goes down by Kenny and you salt lickers the start of the game did not lease it instead made the way of pushing group the minions and is going to force his way to push down will be under licorice is Turrentine cannot. That's happening I'm almost very curious as well about the bill that Keen decides to go for with his Victor you can go semi tank with Victor very easily I'm your okay it's just from tariffs or some people even going as far as Frozen heart but we'll have to see how it does develop if he wants to be a full 80 threat or maybe a midline Maids there and told the line you remember cuz I was across the first crush on Victor that was popular for a bit earlier in the year like last year Cloud 9 attacked the kassadin 3 level 6 Clash of Sloan from her if she doesn't tell afford so after this debt he can teleport back out but fence Karen might decide to Camp that if I was him I just returned to the mid lane tier right now has opted to go topside set in the truck was are going to go right there spiritual he walks down some nice counter gang from Spirit from a freaking out about it from his kleptomancy would get too much more 8hp as well as some ad2 Prine Lane with and harass me right now though it's on the warpath. They're going to get slammed Peterbilt play for Spirit ghost junglers fire in the way over and over now since Jared revealed himself on the war that he was trying to go back to Midlands but this is big for bottom one of the big reasons you don't expect Spirit to be playing like this is patient wants to freeze up the minions as much as possible if he still doesn't have a keystone usually we see into backing buying boots and having a predator online that's too successful games one account want to proactively with know by looking at Kean right here then wave is Lily stacking up infants during going to Edge through to block out the Minions that as well. They know that nobody else can make it from bottom Lane in time showing earlier if you cannot play 1 vs. 3 of the damage and the pull back in the top sides now since karyn's on the board 222 on the top side of the map as a free car trying to reset the put out bottom side as well and this should be the first in the game that we get points for Champion kills per minute that means on both sides but if we can fix the folders for Deadpool kills in 5 minutes. This is very much both teams at that thing the expectations that was different on both sides will this last the entire festive I've got a little bit harder to save for the game number one action everyone yours at home that have been watching the 2018 World will be accustomed to a fairly quick Pace increasing over the course of this tournament and this one no different now we are getting to the point where pass it in here is getting to his level six and we'll be able to actually have some agency he is down a severely NCS because of the tell for that he used topside to try and protect key but that will change over the course of this game has been able to pick up his first evolution on that Hextall remember but cheaper where are the ruins Sonic and biscuits here to get there any sort raised in line for the manifold on a whole lot of you and evolve Cube first what is very much about the shield and single Target damage molesto the wave clear exactly what we're thinking with the speed boost speed so important in any age Fox matchup to allow you to try and do not doubt you sweet spot and remember you can actually get the Cuban Spade whether you use it on a champion or onto a minion and you can use it twice in an escape potentially so a lot of ability that a kite but doesn't mean it's going to be any less susceptible Yanks when is father's death with Manito Dimensions manaflow band you can also build into some more men or later but currently Cloud 9 on the bottom half of the map now turning their eyes for Smith's Lube up it'll be a fight fight going to be a collapsible a potential for before it goes back and forth one level this could be better find a stunt with the Alistair will they engage on a Tuesday as of late colors that leaders employed in Florida and it's just going to be there and nobody promised me to pick up as well now he wants to talk but is licorice recital for the first time one V1 I can't paint and look at the damn it to me through the key was on for cool. It's okay blades hitting them again. Winter saving their ultimate though they know that everyone else was revealed on the bottom side of mouth sores appear one-v-one neither of them committing too hard and if there is a flash all in from this ain't talked to one of those tears metal base stats behind the picture a lot of Mind Games around the flash uses between the atrox and the victor once again settle down for a little bit and 1100 Goldie for cloud nine including a steel on the Blue Buffalo can watch this war before the jungle again you said he's down to 50% HBC night makes a call to charge in on the three members that have separated from framer no damage comes out of Zion that reduces the wall Quest level 6 is what it is Africa freaks favorites but
