and it was night and day Acadian manhandled that Matt Davian one of the new guys on the squad definitely performing well and its first playoff really a bandsaw Dona Ana bladder a kindred tsmc to do well to Kindred band so might just keep seeing the same bands time moves on rekordbox might find something new but the difficulty is TSM keeps playing different things you got to figure out what it is the rock be afraid of hereall right what combinations are we looking through there are some other options as well making adjustments from last name to this game that echo-fox could make having different answers people talking about Swain being one of the big answer to listen to at least being have so much more Effectiveness and something like the Corky and I was a lot more a lot more crowd control for the TV have more options for set up and that can also work better with a jongleur early on the same throughout the whole Theory season 1 by Banning its role and there's the same as games do they don't want to have to see any thought of early game control you want to be able to take the matchup be super confident that it's not going to be thisearly guys going to start out here brush once again back to the Darvon is the same from TSM talked about this and they have different opinions from the saying driver is not viable against the Thunder playing to safely in the early game you're not going to get what you need and high and Cole were saying that well as long as you don't find those plays after the resident Fox lineup does Caleb more than something like a wreck by Jarvan brings attack speed the entire team a very effective early on can build tank tank initiation for the team so there are a lot of options one of the big things about the popularity of the champion is its versatility University Lodi echo-fox back on the age Rock strain the top of the previous game theory I would say good game on a truck over there and not one so they will come for and can be a strong leader of 4th Ave at 8 it's in a lot of Matt just put it intoheads up because the train now works for singing can get the damage off with their three Taco bron James and Cassandra back on the table for there it is they get the credit for the bands coming through that's what I got box well of the deck and let's do a recap yhec Roman even before the changes recently was a good match up in 2 HRS with the extra speed you can take it. You can go for the all-in now you also get more damage by stacking up your cues in Maine as a solo laner he gets a lot more levels early on so you can be much more of a Bruiser you don't have to be a rocket like you from the jungle and we are expecting this to be Top Lane but I meant in trouble because it can still be flexed again because it's less popular to be a jungler but certainly a possibilitycrazy coming out and it's even crazier that makes sense if you fight present as well we saw objects really explode on Alessandra able to follow Acadia around I'm just from having the kind of game he did in the previous looks like they are also looking towards the bottom Lane like everybody else that Calista last time around so much different 40s dance in different Lookout turn off the Nocturne they don't know looking at possible snowballing Lanes ahead with a crown plus dr. Lesage regalio dive is like the most insane.against this coffee tastes like throw your stuff out from long range and not be dope why so hard or should I put the ultimate and bomb on Monday to leave you with one of the guys using the L of blades early on Todd Dulaney get your harassment out strong leading pattern especially one hell of a way to work well with Ravi Bronx done very quickly King Lane I do like this round out here and that you called earlier as we're loading it to the game but this plane is another very common answer into lissandra super effective more tank he has a lot of these other options of setting up junglers sustaining through the engagesopen find a plan to lasondra cuz you so popular and SilverStar now but you can also do the long-range damage spell cause route Phoenix to me is much more of the law that comes from the timing on activating his taxes and his choices there with moving people around have been very good in earning that's dumb you know victories in Spring and I do like the Colossus lineup as a response to a very obvious least I've had two composite we expect the stopwatch to come through, at some point in staying this encounter and lysandra in Gallia that wreaked havoc over in that has not been disrupted even better for them with Hector into aatrox was DSM could still have a Slaughter of an early-game the coaches shake hands with one looks like here either way it one team is heading to match point that I see reason the best ofand it's now how well do you play Russia the great game one for most of it and a very weak game to be the cemetery listing in game one was almost invisible and seconded promoting better. TSM poised to make some I promise you expected it based on the regular season the higher-seeded matchup it's been a close fight on we go to send the wrif 101 alright pivotal game 3 who's going to turn the tide in this theory is often times the best advised we think so much momentum go with Fifth Third game pick up Ian pulling ahead 2-1 alright from on the table here for Echo fox go again every time I see it we mentioned possibilities going for more creative level one that's pushing to see more creative level ones are going for aggressive invades when you do have Champions like this to try and utilize it especially the best of fires and carve out some sort of early Advantage but it looks like and it might actually do it the lady has a possibility here is Spotify Ward though very defensive level 1 of course the instant drink at Ward you know Acadian can watch the other ways around knows where they're headed to just slink away from Martha. Much issue doesn't see if it would go down instead Place one of these I was actually not single brush over by the Raptors and Edith are high-value ghost poro they're right behind the Red Bluff in Wild bottom side smoothie try to sneak in there for a little counter invade to see if you could sneak some Vision a little bit deeper not going to be the case you mentioned Caleb lives, that is indeed to pick up there so the early aggressive Landon can be strong yeah I really am we have enjoyed it quite a lot of people have the ID in the back of their heads of the cognitive old where you have to scale up for super Lake in and you have to have a Lulu and again this Juggernaut actually just such a very effective Champion early on in the lake bed specially with this room taken so we'll see how much difference is bottom line makes last time around ya the Galileo Was the Same Book Calista is such a big part of your clothes and needling that and going aggressive I expect you to be favoured here I expect them to do better and we saw and a blunt it took like three plates before those fellows just in the spread out if you want to so that could be happening this though is off activation for top when Broken Blade should be handling winning this matchup over again solo charge up conqueror very very easily you can push the wave got us on Route 1 Summoner down very important for this bottom line with y'all in Ausable expensive Summoners exhaust is not the yellow or ignite of course they can come by when you're looking at a lot of like this doesn't make a lot of sense yeah because you have so much utility out of it later on does me maybe they'll be less options for those kills here I want to go to Vertical jungling that was Acadian takes his topside top half of his jungle and then comes in for the Scuttle the blue buff the drive in a rush doing a very similar thing and actually a new look now for early recall matches on Jungle not doing it either yeah and again when you're talking about opting into splitting the jungle find the Kellogg and this time around and he's able to finish it off first Blood Money freak that is terrifying that is absolutely terrifying but yet again they just had the damage yeah alright so Phoenix glasses away but wants to get a punishment off for them trying to yank and so he walks back up to deal some damage in the trade while Acadia is still here we're going to disrespect me like that you going to make you pay for it flashes head they get the kill he's rolling with the extra long sword on top of the blue Smite already and he said up once again to rule the jungle you really is a such a solid start brand blue Smita Fairlawn Court in more stops than Rush is going to look really solid and I find a lot from mid laner they get angry when they're gay trying to get out a little bit of damage after the tail end of it does pay off but the stepping up like that both of them self to the second flash that's a nice image of police car well this one is going to stay here and rest I should be able to continue the invade Russia knows he's got no mid later in addition to the side by the way the big chicken is it worth in a bunch of small ones as well this is getting out of hand rapidly it's getting faster and faster and see if his favor rust and barely able to do some minions out and replay but with the teleport timing here I'm assuming Phoenix teleported to a Minion out in the wave may be yet but I'm okay so he went he was just walking around and I just can't really good job there by Katie and immediately returning to the scene of the crime punishments of Blacklist mid laner hear no xtra-vision for Phoenix no extra pressure around there. There's no play it feels good to get those we definitely take those but I said I was going to bring up for Phoenix was that he was Frozen released warding mid laners in all of the LCS for all of us yes he has been great and Lane yes he has been such a force for echo-fox winning a lot of their games especially like snowy play it was very aggressively though and has a fairly low warding numbers with can come back to bite you sent me when you've just blown both of your stomach so far paying off pretty well and we look at the other lanes those small Advantage the echo Fox do well somebody's picture based on Match app and that really heal forced out for some defensive play earlier play out of broken play button up so that's coming or Advantage back and turn around the next time don't listen for his right there about stop a big is going to get found out there's a control it behind their Red Bluff as well still giving him entering the river now but they're trying out for Acadian more stuff that have black this could be nice. They're by Phoenix. Fertile Drake picked up bottom when pushing for them Apollo Dhaka love so stable for this teeth yet again findings to pressure here really like that talk about pick in the second half pays off fourth of the El campin Tanaka plenty of Damage Done to his fill of Brooke inflatable just trade that back and forth solo wants to revive he's not going to get too so keep my throat feel so low on B12 got to see that one time and he just goes for it right under the turret immediately takes down solo is rewarded for his till he walked back right there to try and Dodge out of wrong with you but I will still able to hold on still landed and the collapse from echo-fox able to take over control of this River that is pretty late for them over broken plate Lincare flavor series real
