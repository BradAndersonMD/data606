things gragas priority for both top laners and I did a lot to try and protect fudge as he is still new to the LCS a lot of jungle Focus as far as the band of Courts coming through the duty to ban out the pantheon Thalia Olaf triple combo but now with a lot more people playing near that's also going to be coming through that it's kind of Bulge 240v power picks for Jungle do cats wipe them all in first round of bands and a cloud 9 have already showed their very willing this happened year-in and year-out Analysis of the pro League trade good junglers it lets you think there was one that's going to win all the matchups and it's impossible otherwise but the line and they still get to Leah or they still good to eatwasteful I'm not sure if I'm missing something just feels like it's too much going on where the spring slides do you like Pantheon really good at being proactive setting up gangsta getting pills early your Olaf these ones much more powerful I make so I think that CSM showing yesterday that they actually are not a proactive early game team once again that they were set up with all these possibilities and they weren't able funeral to make the early game moves before you apply place was able to get two so such a strong team fighting Synergy for them so I think that's something to look at from yesterday45 minutes straight and as their bands coming through to get rid of one to go with bits in TF and who dere is left up go to Leah is back there as you mentioned is healthy for Str junglers are going to trade to Leah back fruitier than hey you better yourself and not going anywhere you brought out two bands but you're both getting a strong jungler here across the bow in the Cloud 9 side will see what really comes through the end of the day all right now TSM going to hover in a eukaryotic know if you really make a lot more sense down here and I'm going to be in for lost yeah if they are early locking Calista I feel like that does box them pretty heavily into relying on trying to lowball round bottom side around early dragons and that is really hard forces Cloud 9 clap. I have had some of the most aggressive and quickest early games of any team in the league with blabber absolutely popping off I think blabber blabber performance currently is it some of the best that we have ever seen from him so they're going to have to do something to try and contain this jungle generally going to want to get some winning soloplay matchups and white pictures of Camille does leave you open to the Jacks answer once again fudge already tried to use it and Cloud 9 were very willing to send bladder up there early on focus and make sure you can get to at least your level six there where you can ask that the Camille yep look back to Cloud 9 verse golden Guardians yesterday and a blabber level one games he was stupid latest level one in that top played in the end there's a lot of pressure up there as fudge battle biles in the jungles how to make sure that cloud 9 got the better of it you got the easier it as well as soon as possible wrap beer he knows he's not perfect until more bands coming through because you know you lit to Leah go through eighth of the band face cuz that you're not getting the terrestrial yourself so no going with some coverage on his outsideMisfortune I'm thinking of Samira maybe in that list as well to give perk the more control after wave chords Midland this already is looking like TSM showing multiple tools for these very aggressive Thalia Camille Kaiser all look like they want to jump in on stuff you're going to need some guarantee cc to set those up so gallio is a really smart ban hear it from from cloud nine you take away the combination Camille galio plus another Global that you don't want to have to deal withalrighty Rock there is a Galea gone we're waiting for the second and out of TSM as we want to see you what bottle and they're trying to hide and protect against with of course they would have first dibs on the support pick as well and that means with us Rush band they get to grab the board and then keep trash off the table as well work by the way just by the fact that I think people often think of him as they actually His Highest win rate Champion among his top 6 most place is right this is quite bad it is one of any Midland I can see what rate is very highwhat is the REI always tries to ride street memes but not great draft strategies always but I think that it was late day of already committed to this Jacksonville match up topside and as beer is is very selfless minutes. He has his own escapes built-in Wave Control really well you protected with the oread have been as well so I think Brooks is set up to be very good for the squad moorgate that's how I talk about Hearts CC long-range here and gauge for Sword Art he's supposed to be the one to pull the trigger for TSM I signed him to this team they've drafted around so many possibilities of picking people off your with the Leonardo added on top this one has to be action-packed yeah so Miss Fortune elsewhere comes through and there is a small concern by The Misfortune being grabbed because look at the opposing lineup look at thatDSM exact situation we're lost didn't get to have any fun playing Miss Fortune against the Camille there's some follow-up in DeLeon. There's some follow-up in the Thalia there's even in the case of a needs to be before she does not tight away easily games yet well done does goonie delete you is going to be a question I have asked if you could have just gone Sia write could have picked it up at the option to just immune the knock back or UNCC from you in the cage or anything and private he's like Donna. We're going to be off with the birds were going at math and it's going to work out so I want to make it work that night there's an important difference here is that Ben has an Al estar which can a head but the Camille back out of her own hextech ultimatum so that it breaks it and he should be able to live if your bodyguard Alistar that that you can foryour Misfortune really going to be up a lot to use vents play Kobe but I wanted to weight loss had an Alistair to okay I want I want to be clear on something that has not had a good year on TSM okay looking across the LCS so far this year speaker has been the best player I think Pee-Wee's been second best wins order came in like this was the guy was replaced dierksen is dominant player to ever going to look to you as soon as we built around him much like direction for 6 years straight was the Midland and the LTS support he has the worst kid on the team gets worse kill participation on the TV is not getting things done he is dying and not helping things happened sword art is not having a good 20 21 on TSM coming just off of World Finals appearance I need to see him step up I want to see what else he can do in this game he's got some Leon it it can look good but I need more of that player Ultimate Ears or freak is going to lose his mind let's take a look he's coming out of the bass a little later they do have a swap over to another sweep or double sweeper opener for TSM that smells possible late invades then well you know speakers the right Champion for what the rocks are cooking and blabber can I have to buy Rockaway the sweeper does not find a wart though I love patience real life you know tsmc sweepers a lot we're going to wait on our Wards let him go for the sweep cool we can work afterwards I hate that we do see that the attempt their sweep song forward Sword Art going to take his down to the bottom side to but then you when you have a support going sweeper this early on dropping the The Ward and then switching over that really does kind of give away bottom side Focus if you're investing in offensive trinket at level 1 then you really want to make play so they're going to put it put it right to the test immediately freaked your price tag on Sword Art and see if it is worth it here because I expect speaker to get down there and try and take advantage of that we are is taking Crux as part of the clear so it's going to be the full 6 camps most likely want to point out that he is doing the exact same flash list Camille now. And you know done the exact same you do fudge flash done black bear slaps and hope they have enough but regardless of how much more we already saw who he learned to use it as part of the least show didn't take an escape to it all meant to be okay though she's going to you since we first defensively under his turret theoretically to be a very hard drive all things considered and either way he's going to get his XP and now has his Escape Plan a pretty sure yeah I mean you can just keep W spam trading the early stages versus the Jacks Just landing gear outer cone of w trying to get off the Q not over committing to it unless you're able to be out the Counter Strike otherwise pledge will have the last say about its platter just power clearing as normal no no kind of variation Sierra can easily finish a flowclear before Scuttle spot us one of the big reasons why is rosan it to prominence should be able to finish up on topside give fudged the full extra Comforts of knowing that they've got crab as well as what that scryers or pop top bottom side to no surprises for either team they know speakers down their bottom side is not really in danger of a dive on cloud nine separate either has Red Bluff plus details and burnt going to be knocked down the rest of his rights start the sax going clutch going to find himself with the stun know he won't come to Bear can you get in the way to flatten up locket stop playing so Good by blavor you have to interrupt your meal after she gets the hookshot connected to the wall just flashes a right to the spot where her a little sore legs are sticking in the wallet is able to bear slap her down but I thought this was a pre-emptive and he's not able to get the hookshot out early hoody kind of fish tossing it out but sticking around after he did the Deep Ward on enemy cruggs patience pays off freak blabber strikes once again and this man has just been outstanding for cloud nine he is such an outstanding player that game was awesome it's the most Telegraph play the jungler should have bought side he's going to take Scuttle it's perfectly in regardless though Cloud 9 by also love to see when toppling is get punished for not bringing flash where are you know either there are junglers doing it where the graves at night bad for a while oh yeah I've got to dash in my kit and win my duels it and you you kind of flex on people in a one V one of them in and they cry when you don't have your flash for instances like we just on the top side but attacking top laners that go that route and try and try and get the ignite so they cannae go on your one-v-one so they can turn your wife you want a ride is is kind of I know it's satisfying to see at a certain level especially I do for a for the top laners that that don't go play ignite and I know it's very common now but it's seeing faces Alice's dye-free 6 or like you could go after shock and younes Abboud how to hold her eyes but she lets go out of Mana GBA ROM PS2 that big one hitting but you just got to sit out no problem there and it is going to be cloudy tonight starting at the dragon because of its he's right back into midlane there as your has priority Vulcan even goes for the tray to keep tsm's bottom lane from fishing around and the day or going to be grabbed Midland pressure it's going to be enough yet the first EP obviously quite relevant there so bladder Smite ban okay early ocean Dragon submit it's in pretty good start in your Cloud 9 should feel comfortable cuz one is going obviously the first one of the top one is great and the lanes too much everywhere
