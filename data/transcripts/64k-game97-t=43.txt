she may have one fifty two thousand forty springs when that was the end of one of the most dollar right we've ever seen else yes it's true that car nineteenth when thirteen three in the spring of two thousand thirteen and then twenty nine four in those of us are thirty three in the summer for a thirteen point four nine forty and spring of two thousand fourteen and the above all the idea that point six years ago there is for the filming it when this thing yeah have that best when percentage of any team and every surpassing your own borders record by that throw his begat want to comment as an actor into it looks like a who's it really is incredible i think that that we saw that raised about i have a few motive for the dominant with a look going to retake and a number one but because it's been six years living there there's entire groups of wildlife things that have not gone to stuart it's cloud nine domination line they've been good internationally they headed to the world my bottle the yours but really did what they are them quite a mess of things that i've lived of the lot of it n. it's high return to get the really the should've few years ago back when the film made out of the world's while while ago but they are backed up for now in all new roster of vote will last and initial about a member of the heat that was gone as of this year this group has come together incredibly well as the province which side of rap why was that he loo they still want record levels of our night and not and i'm glad they have switched over toward blue side is a bit too wasted that most teams made when they have to waste it something like what a plot against last game in part paid a price for by the analyst is a great job break me down how fond i just call please most everyone for state warren we say not available does mean that we persisted have to take something new to orion is no place and they cannot get the president of the age rocket what is the bill is accused of and the is turned on this kid a low that good low of those games themselves could not quite in two ways than he was dead and then the best one thought would these here is to be on the most highly prized champion davis fact that is the product would prefer to write about what rest potential of that yeah there is an outside chance that they could like that one take in mate lane and then take the time again played in the atrocities of the soul of the very well that that's pretty low potential the biggest thing here though is bizarre how does that because clematis on red side their pants got more limited and now in ares most potent champion is available and is locked down into a free strong who think that shows very clearly province as they sat in the most important contest and g. m. t. v. news brown people birth but every time we will never let it in for themselves but that is that the north boasted of did you know work on these is definitely the source of our income in whitehall way though they need the rest of our rap as soon as possible maybe because the complaint the top of both sides will talk with brad analogous to the viv the it's got double a big to contest now are used yet audience that the three of them used her for a v. c. you when we beat stars and i think this is so interesting now knowing that the first part of the draft has been relatively the same in most of the gains it's that angela davis has the most variation in one of the reasons the recall is big on the dark days sure it'll lead based paint the gun but what what he does indeed team how much sits behind the energy that makes it difficult to go with a safe place and to me thank goodness the scene i'd pick someone who could help of values is mobility with elliot i think that was the one big misstep people to fight with rubies draftees drafting an affiliate with nothing to protect him a lethal can stretch to offer the lantern and play and walked all the other tools to try to live so will see how that plays out from the savings and when the argument is that like most was the one most rumbles by giving him the most of the champion of one then you can build around it was always about are the ones that this time around before that flew to get possession or self sufficiency on while that well as adults that has the automated roots in most cases the bands that come through three trouble they've come out a whole lot replied ride of paul table in the thick cloud nine democrats are river water used against textures and they don't have that that yeah it's a standard composition for cotton i'm peter arnett is something that is happening behind her in a lot of other series who seemed just because of the waitress played out i haven't seen yet as you mentioned rocks beneath your name and the last thing is he nice to be holding his news he's kept them a better way will want he was like this idea what we'll take that as the if you boss candiotti is the lovely jungle pressure we may see that the room saver comes as the wind bit later they know not to be up against the obvious question that was in yasuo right than previous game but now the job of most of the idea that feared it might be the smiths you was it not for that will not really expected here but clever wow what would be the last it principle yeah let's light through all the candy and ignore hasn't played some forms with you no sense of unity and cool you read about that and it's the call by guiliani the fact that cigarette has been sold on and the rubble of the is the thing you match it with all this is specifically how would you like that matter plays out because it can go either way i see it go either way warnings games and it's gonna be on c. high to perform again and wildlife in not in the any flexibility here that it's going to pretend that rolls by the white house have laid it on high level was the to go on as i recall it is a big deal to change no food team by fighting for the better it is it's a show ignore world than at the second best support of this year the holy man right bible been getting here is that it is for the case of sexual lot i'd like this route of flight was that you mentioned that cloud i don't want to do work really really well for them you wipe a fresh toby of values they say they like the robledo sundry as well as a frocks we know liquors not yet at first glance and completely ok what would both teams did hear you can look it fly quest rapid see all the power kicks in the fact that the clock on and you could get me find sake is when it's a crowded cloud nine let them get these things but we've seen clyde i make a draft look back and make you know great dress look average and so much of it is big with how quickly they move around the map how well we play together the way to control vision and if they can close to this one out with the current draft they have as we mentioned it would be the most dominant individuals played in lcs history and thought i'm going up girl records would be fun to see them do it with this squad has never won domestically in north america book or we're ready to go into this state is you can take you live in a game three and you wanted to smoke with misread a cloud nine to zero of likewise in this series the last breath of life that cloud nine or like was playing war three one way or that ms and he had it all that gate three way the jihad one overfly quest easy however clive died on those ways the thru victories of maybe i was unhappy with what was those from around yeah and get to know is is currently truly zero for cloud nine unlike the one series the average cost of disagree over here including team i think it is really important to focus on the temple happening and what happens to the middle english because the syndrome rumble that joke is key to the mighty good to see her pantheon please perfect and half drowned in plain view if the rumbled your bite you went wrong with with impunity and not get punished when he spurred his cool down all having the way of the underworld all can start moving into reverend act with c. nine is kind of hoping happens soul that but what for the rewards are but what for centaur pass because he is the candidate in the master of the pre three make it already once again i'm not a lot of really aggression in the very early game we see the republicans go with aids lately for plays the fool believe we've seen this game received not what what happened he did have a writer we both feel varieties of one minute into this summer robert unless it seems place to live by them out red lovely for both of us were never go read towards thesis that by the u. cleveland wrath of soft side and the jargon of a clear cruisers blew up as well anything norris lot of top side river would fight fight fight to expect argue that she pulled it towards the outside well we've seen is that some of the clever tour de exactly when they start reading group or rounds of lucite to get to the good before the jury that the law has actually life be very little on with some drummers there would consider it she's get where they're actually forcefully position for reporting the surprise of gained its young has so much trust in nearly as though he's glad he didn't hear you fish for the past and just to them of the hired really a fan of bloodthirsty would have seen of him one of the news is that he's been a fight with the finn one thing he spiked upward settle on sharpened whose because you'd be visible damage rabies going blue but the highest or worse party theme his conventional jungle clear to all women that they use that in your second half in some of the genetic data we're both ready or your vigor recall that you could've mobilized yes and he's about to finish a fifth camp where has heavy on his feet on his fourth so in terms of overall case that's advances centaur hasn't gone for smoking tightening floated away right now is what happens if this is playing aggressively is not punished by gate he can actually get that will free shop on a chartered but that's what actually needs to be here live at five not actually taking right at the perfect timing of black figure of a second killer instinct will feed you would be of getting caught on appealing but so far so good for likewise don't really serve thank you replied pretty far he did or top side leverage to that side of the wave pushkin compulsively illicitly easily get off a he will play out for the well liberated solo battling family for thought i don't have the for more than a lot but he while how foolish it and they are also i was right for what i think lauren think to flash forth i still want that way i thought how the mall shopping that first wave a lot of times the center will go back for me recall there yet but the second stories and that's probably would see that thought was happening but just she b. c. c. not a perfectly just getting the of the pantheon stone into the burst of everyone else is enough to bring licorice down and also very forgiving every one of us is that identical would appear for liberty loved about what really on the one that's a bit more sustained as they helped me in the one we want those bells tolling come down the line because another resigned violet really am a fan of coals of berges so save your worst do not recall the seal that these are down the line is a much worse we thought of gerber does the leader of the rehearsal and that's it for people for us to feel that for one given region in the interview with our love for now the way look for the back of the flash with sandra been visiting thea being cold hearted montpelier that especially when these people's six but the fact that he's been able to get that recall blasting want does increase his threat to leave if he has sent for him what we call shadowing him we're any time you go on pee wee centaur movie of the house after as enforceable by the yourself a civil office wall of the way the view that having sell it as we enter the demented in gets over the wall and see that success and katie's pew week which take control of it at least for the first five minutes in this country of also begun control on planes so far what with our lives i've no violence of one of the outvoted spear is the most powerful bottling two oh thirty nine film of bombing to have lived ago in the film of classified as apathy in the fourteenth of awfully then go on for free throw this one that one way and i have all these lot of up and white or the movie completely stopped i think that's really good color in terms of macha us and give the rate is let's see ninth the retires during roster was first team all perot there's no argument that they were all the best performing in the role but in this series in particular the biggest yeah so to speak and want you when is he had been playing for even so i was even had c. s again it is as an award into liquor he's been playing quite well and centaur is beginning all i really came first why what is that they've been involved in pushing the tempo down on going getting kills getting dumped on the list yeah by the cloud nine are getting a lot don't hear through bottling we knew it nor was the one that big is your first wife was never too old growth for right it is not related from islam is rhythmic gave place right now with the flesh
