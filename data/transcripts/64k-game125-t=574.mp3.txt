they are all easier than a breaker cuz they would be one one at the end of the pictures and then just look forward to that eventual playoff I was Cloud 9 with your assume he's all going to happen in this season so excited just back right. I'm surprised it's that wasn't first pick instead of talking to it Philly or take you like Spike West bands of Cinderella and xayah since there's a combined is a for no record by Bjork turn on Cinder and a V and O record for coffee on diet budyou're playing a dangerous game and every single player is going to hell for this ribbon is miserable in my head like anytime you start like prancing around in animation canceling that she's going to East on you and smack you four times in the face. Needed but you know what you'll take that it will get Broken Blade on his 10 three and twenty one set of the split totally Style on the NBA rosters against Immortal and then it's basically just been from a band after work which was also in Spain Rhythm player when he played in the TTL yeahI do Wonder like ribbon players no Riven matchup sir and a lot of times River gets banned because they're like wobble Viper knows this matchup still extremely well like I don't know if I want to chance it. I feel like the second the match of a problem this garbage but it also may be a little bit more Notch likely a Broken Blade wouldn't do this if you want to come here as we have matchups lines in the good things that are broken plate on this one be Lo Lem Estados 40s enflaquecer paleo thrash you want to find out a few times has has a very very low base that durability if you run it at all impressed by the way not a great protector you can just pop wild turtle that's why I so often you will see it scared was Hans Gunther from the to bet kind of paint protectors Treasures of is the third place like solving in third place I feel like just because of the power of the lanterns do it also allows ignored to be ignore in the mid game in terms of trying to find pic so I don't mind suspectit off like us band noises billionaire not quite sure what make the tea is them come pick and not know it was so good at being afraid of Liana for scary smart there is well we know it's so good as one of your ex's best champions of all time so okay for a lot of fans over at what are some piercing bands The Undefeated Sia and grog has an incredibly popular jungler is The Logical Choice here after they throw a few Jungle Band out TSMat least after yesterday just watch the violin Dish Nation in their team comps and I think they're doing the best of it now people keep hovering Zach I do think it's good and seemed a little bit I in Elsie and like a tiny little bit in OCS I know we start top link but it's a little weaker or so. I think we will see it one day I think that's very very likely here at Stefani's band that may be the next best tank, to pick up his single game so far this split. Start one game I can play there it is been torn out his first. Game of the split here first of the LCS I believeand regardless it's going to be an exciting one here is I think we'll have some fun and gay if you want to point out exactly the same as jungler snowing in about damage profiles and is also pretty cool cuz if they want to they can Flex this towards the toppling it's probably going to be playing on this Aurelio though it does mean that broadcast is there only a piece threat which will make it a little spooky if there can be some good Mr stacking coming true from the Zac cuz if you remember the last game flyquest play TSM it was in before and this was this was like an incredibly discuss game because GSM did Pantheon Thalia and then flyquest had just a bunch of stealing to head for in unitthousand gold at some point in the game but like what is so good in a 5ft 5in competition they just like stayed mid and I think this back and hips are Leo's and the Oriana are scaling picks for the flashlight do this is not as Extreme as it was before but it still is picking me up Tempo team comp and plaque was just looking to go lie and I'll see if I can do that right I know we're going to see if bury tankies back you might want to dust beer with it for a while cuz he wants to buy an armored Cavs versus the Teen comp but if Alice is very squishy and Stampy the Champions have back line access Broken Blade II hope this act in the back line that is going to reach the top and kind of exploded as well I would be afraid we're all totally sure we could definitely be attacked and end with one of them carries gone I think he's in Connecticut teen fights that way I did mention uptempo that got to be the one to or Proactivfind those pictures of this relation and we'll see if they can do it TSM coming off of win out the previously undefeated Cloud 9 black Westhoff an uncharacteristic lost a battle for second place on the line right now and to be completely honest with you freak I did not expect I don't think a lot of people really truly expected to be Club Mac and the year has been so up-and-down for TSM hasn't been like 2 of 0220 she was actually going to start 02314 turo they lost two in a row they want two in a row they lost two in a row and it almost looked like you were to lose for because no one expected to be caught and I know what are moving to 67 and then you're thinking hey the chi want to treat him lose you can they really be what was the rating for flyquest soap narrative flip the TSM could potentially make this week we're coming into week 7 it was if they don't beatcall Donna Flack what's the top two teams of League they would have been six and eight and maybe even outside the playoff picture with two weeks to go riding to kind of outperform now they have an opportunity to 20 this week against the two other best teams in the ALCS and really being that strong position tied for second with organs left and I'm not in the game I want to add more teams that hundred thieves before he ended their week 7 77th place if you some drops this right they be tied for third with a drop keys and I was he doing reasonably well but that's kind of the state of the standings where I'm third place is 50/50 essentially in the league right now based on results so you know Astra spending has game goes really pushing is almost every level one leading goal with Yabba the sniper damage and and the range on it so expecting to have the bush I really am making me pain to watch Philly fun games Raleigh the next year's differentlyChampions what yeah and as we talked about right at the end of Camp so I pledged his kind of reset what are expectations are coming into this game instead of softened him so often just for sick Tumblr side is he just wins these matchups against a truck because they can kind of handle it but this Lane position is very common because aatrox actually can't step up to set up look to see how much Broken Blade can win this Lane by that was greedy greedy since it's very difficult incredibly dangerous so then just Darda can't stop playing or does he try and move mid for this Duo potential of an Aralia stunlock into a rocket need to win the early game at some point so you need to keep your eyes on dark talk and also house and torn tries to slow him down for regen very, jungle tack if you don't know this one just dealing damagemonster turns on the hundred thousand which is like a few help per second per monster tag so I need to go to top HP as I get this easy on those because I'm worth nearby love that I'm going to keep within bakery close skin Farm but dark is faster the game lower overall champion musicals on future really interesting that it was fought it out so dark action to the start that didn't start at blubaugh it was just seen by Zachary try and convert them to it it's a start I like but I think we're going to see a jungle dual down by that blue bus going to be as my fight is coming over this going to the battle like I don't want to go to blow 500 cuz I don't know if the other person might have to walk across the map to get some more done but yeah that has has equalize the camp count for what it's worth Zac Jungle doesn't have a slower clearer than rocket necessarily he just has to work Inc tool so like any situation where santorin can just see training camp with our talk is a good tip to a 2% Torrance long as he's stopping Dart off from the deciding Lee what is the things to you as well as sleep these are two of the very best friend was the ALCS right now at 77% which blood percentage display was the number one player got it as well and he's like at 4 in like generic gold the early game stats Ben Torres number one is really getting bullied but he's out farming every opposing jungler across the league so far it's also is emblematic of the fireplace. I need was hoping for an opportunity Derek while Frost would have been aggressively with their Fork on again but didn't want to force too hard into the misfortune Misfortune definitely packs a punch really a little spooky to try and gain how much damage she does really on but so far mostly trading Farm back and forth total so far in a farm lease some of that is to expectation of Philly says good job early learning very good at last thing under threat you can keep yourself from dropping too much there early set Landing leave but there is a bigger way for my PIN to take as he started says backwards days out of the W Ranch No Bra Day is just a small hundred fans goalie for TSM across the Great Plains at the front with the word down at the Battle garlic to the jumps the way he hates want us to flinch has that could have walked past the shower and a half of 3 ft to Dustin out of rain for the floor as well and is it going to be enough to tell you. It is beautifully executed by TSM play through your strong Lane and that's what TSM does with a very strong leader in set and broken plates it almost looked like that was going to be stocked with Santorum got that to man's done but she had said was not to be deterred biggest clean house here to watch us have one more time Central us both and Gerson and delays this fight with me all day. We took her out of her Negros to the church doesn't warm up until here and then broken play blast Double Tree damage on top of your ultimate and it's just to wash the church I work and both kills go on you're acting so he can take that cold in his Midway match up that was nothing short of impressive I did not know that I was going to work but it work yet effortlessly we've been doing some dive rating segments on countdown 10 I want to see if one of the best rated we didn't write a chat it was one of the best I don't have the cars up here to Chicago lead of yet to get first Blood almost every single game. I can do that was just amazing now it's about pushing down it is, probably for a wild turtle but it's not like us to come back from an early deficit and what about that guy is are people heads just teleport back to link himself I think I passed over the pass aversion to TSM would have had this year didn't recall a match ups to be like oh yeah I just can't wait to get a few things back to lay like you're a jerk and she sees top way to make something happen GSM also now on the bottom side of the map that you can stop leak electric baseboard with the one up in the company. There's no Drake answer back.
