reverse sweep they got to back and fly questions like what's plan to close it out in game 5 but we've had so far in the ALCS playoff even though the exact median and average score line is 321 we may have that one here at work in the day but right now we are on Golden Guardians picking red team decided they lost game 3 on it but it's not going to know we have a draft plan in place it's more assassin bands irelia is left upset is gone instead and pay for them is off the board in Siesta coax right you know what your ass and then and try to see if the dates would have been response or feel just be sent at once more at the lane went rate for FBI in Hootie but such a different team when you compare the agency that FBI and who he had in the previous games do what they had in the last game when you compare the Senate and the karma to what these guys were doing on Caitlin and Bard and even the Lux it isright you know it's like okay they had a place in Glades yeah but the other games they were just mod stirring in teamfights finding pix finding engages so we have to see if gold Guardians get can make it work I would be interested to see if they'll save their last pick 4 hot in this time around but it is not done well in the LCS at all but this is a Duel of Champions that is apparently just ravaging strips across all teeth and this is essentially people are are are described me as an even stronger release reactant style where they feel like you should be able to have full control over any sort of topside TV to we should be able to go aggressive set up the Middle East for years very easily with that protected and if you land that combo to pretty much be dead for any top later so that that is what it supposed to be in execution your jungle is outpacing them you have this monstrous to be too but what has actually beenshow me a scene it is definitely just kind of farm Steven and it doesn't do as much as the other junk like teen sites really have got to be able to Snowball the game and make things happen early because he's just too hard to Pilot in in the later stages and this is the second time in as many days that sponsor has opted into both sides of the same match at work so for example I get steam liquid it alright okay my counterpick is Renekton let's go as what I'm playing and failed to have late game victories against impact they are just like. Actually boxing in the top of match even he was up and gold now he's he's he's like okay my answer is Mordecai's it's like if you want then you'll take anyone who cares if that's the case why don't you play real time to pick up the other side we have in this series The Man played mordekaiser as a counter to Orange and then blind or deaf or blind for the Kaiserwework Kaiser a little confused by the thought process here in the topside he clearly likes play board a lot and that's fine but I'm just very just the idea of how he's kind of a strange to me so what one caveat that will give is that not always are you picking for late right if you just feel that I need to fulfill its role and that is perhaps not getting a lot of jungle attention being scrapped you know it is as far as playing on the topside or perhaps you're forcing qss is they feel that is important to be able to let you know more about the jungler that is important and maybe even though the ones you wanted to hit suorin that he lured us into things that are too strong in the Deep by right I think that's probably my guess at how they're looking at it I do tend to agree that it is very important that you know baby there they're overlooking that somewhat but we will find out we do get a pretty spicy big down here on the bottom side is alionagoing up against that Ash Ash very low mobility and work on it that is so interesting to me like this is supposed to engage from the wreck on with always pick as the rakan counter so to speak with someone that did have a right to answer into it because you could walk down the rakan Fairly simply work on is generally not Tanki enough that if it were gone goes in and you just Q Alta View just kind of died before being able to utilize Mobility to get in and out that being said again this could just be straight up for the 585 less about the interactions between the two and work on paired alongside that Oriana is going to give accessed warp jerks into all the backlight right in the teeth get on top of the graves is Donna and delete those champions from it and that could be very very powerful okay ya Leo coming through so that's really work for the parent with the Leona also you know I think give some additional power to that pick who he on it on a Chevy that has while the agency Demonte on something that cat robe I think that Graves Drake's cover up for the weaknessesquite well but it does still mean that close early and was going to be having to have a good game gear for this team to have enough consisted damage I think if not I'm going to be tracking this jungle match so heavily because it does feel like because got to get things done in the early stages and closer if he gets put too far behind that will be very detrimental for him but like really going to be probably pretty useless late well it's going to be a fun one here as we are done with the draft we got Global Champions a gun from the Montage deer TF his most played second in line is that galio season to go around to the side will see which ones he can impact their Leona Santa definitely spicy I've always a fan of Champs withhold that you just kind of layer over the top of the engaged Senate does this as well does this Graves does this do when someone comes in your almost always arranged to help and put a one shot that chap we seen it work before and Ashley can be a decent Target in Oreana cavities at Target neither have innate dashes in the kit they got to walk or they got a Flash and if there's done they can't flash so I want to see how goodone shot potential is how it's going to go I agree to the Jungle matchup seems really interesting you've got very explosive high damage Champion Middle Lee we see different builds we've seen the essenes rush that she could be supportive enough that we've seen what was the oldest you can be more of a damaged in the front line enough that she's not going to die just her counseling it ever since yours what build that's going to be but you got a decent coverage of damage profile lot of progress on both sides and do or die it's going to be really really exciting DSM-IV stepping up in that previous game having the most dominant game of the series but that was who he off of a gaethje is back on it this time around it is such a clear Target of picking on doublelift it feels like yes he's going to play the Glens but you know if you could just immediately going with the dentist Layton Key Walt you know it's a very easy for the sun has happened where you you cleanse with you from the onus rabies to the elephant that galios going to be all thing on your head that could be pretty frightening it does feel like a game with a lot of qss value with double AP solo lanersMagic Cube from the Leona plus a tremendous amount of CC so we'll have to find out north Douglas is going to able to survive against that kind of dive in Pierce and also in an easy major vulnerable here to wait for me to watch for as we get into the rift did we see what the plans are going to be worth coming down speaker surround going to keep is what he drink it if you want to switch to a sleeper but hasn't put his drink it down if he's doing so okay you have to be very late in that brush to watch maybe later invade potential or looking to be on his own blubaugh it might mean he's going to have some interesting passing down the line and golden Guardians must bring up for a late invade and sure enough speaker or his analytical his homework said do not my words not hear my word is elsewhere it's on the Bluetooth selfie invade me having to know so they won't be spotted by the ward but you're usually on the invite but they will be spotted obviously as they go over toward that blue buff and this will allow speaker to hopefully for his sake I'll be able to get up and then starts vertical jump length no Take that blew away from his opponentsbut that being said if tsm's bottom line is pushed in there's also a defensive war from Golden Guardians over by their blue. So they will know that that is happening and there is a potential FBI and who he going up and try to collapse a tent closer in Vision when they leave to go as a result of this one guess as you mentioned bottling push is coming to the golden Guardians sides that it has been killed on both sides and a lot for the coverage running around goes to the warden your tribe rugs okay if you are ever leaving about of jungle you'll have to go through the river the bottom corner the three in which by the way is where to get as well as of this point to say okay delete has not crossed she has not gone anywhere she's may be going to your top jungle but she's definitely not going to your bottom jungle yeah it feels like at this point because they say just going to take it was may be anticipating the closer we go Blue to blue or not going to be nicely done speak about Broken Blade down closer smited to guarantee the chickens we're going to be bypassed every single board that is very tight timing so I really wonder if it's because I had it with that well timed out that he was thinking he was going to go Blue to red and need to start time for that or you know if he was thinking that he would go Bluetooth blue anticipating a speaker would go there and tried to send it and you just thought would be undefended read now cuz that was very close in like an extra hour to know from the mordekaiser leasing at Blue buff might have gotten Graves that the clear speeds actually you have that red done in types of yours that complicated looking for that one as a 5-minute to make him have a rough time is the blank yeah it's an easy recipe to the way to push it away from so you're going to be really scared and we'll have to see how does medium wave actually kind of shakes out in midlane to really determine who that was better for the other things that that actually does have to go and gold wedding favor is that already based God is backed by off already gotten back to base and this is going to push toward the mate so it will be bad for Bjergsen on the TV as far as the minions and you won't have to go back to pay self to mate potentially could keep the shoved in and 4th Street New York City pick up or recall and closer course why do the bottom step is laying those about to begin from the southern side it's Beka has not yet been in the bottom side but that's generally speaking worth it a flash was asked to be a very easy Target and this is every time they seem to get eyes on on biofrost moment they looked upon ashrae to the previous game it was by Zonnique doublelift off of off of minions honor is our this game file Frost moves up be spotted by that tribe Russian dwarf and Abby Lee doublelist has his flash horse with that trait from who need this is something you've been very willing to do throughout the season has really look for these aggressive trade on to the enemy Marksman and buy a process with him in general just got a charger really making sure that when they are looking for these boots when are looking for is reims from biofrost that they are not spotted on Wards or that they have some sort of other coverage for doublelift because he's getting punished every time is public storage in his favor doesn't say my name is back to himself or half of what he took at the trade plus promenad stacking yet to see any recalls out of the mid lane is going to take me to get some of that back up and overall going to catch the far you got to one see a difference in mid and diersen following take his recall might have lost chapter money or to your ass out here and it would have been worked there to stop the recall because your son had no TP and because he had to wait for a candidate to not lose a full wave on the recall I think it's actually worth taking the hit there but of course you're not sure exactly where he is so we'll be a little bit the way not much of a pain is there from here to me handles that about as well as you can if you picked up the rest of his farm and it will have equalised quite a bit but still that proactive down to the bottom side from him because he had to push ended up getting a 11 CST in the bottom line is that with locks back to the land of catching some of it pretty comfortable item sat here for FBI is he gets once again petcock plus call is a decent one there and double it's not quite as it looks like I'll do is going to help enforce dodging Leona being class listen to just go for the more defensible option but I think I would have the money for be if you wanted it regardless who cares what he has in this one is who he waits on the Middle Lane speaker cannot stop and play towards whom it is not going to materialize so if you land that knock up now from Demonte into a tunnel in Dudley on a walk down your food is just dad's we got to rely on for these got to rely on good position here I do want to see you just became a broken play try to repeat on author of the article off on a two-post 6 on mordekaiser kind of weird that they're supposed to start and Low by the way I really going to matter that much but it does feel like a like a minor thing that had broken play been wanting to freeze you taking off early fiber regardless if he has said getting some extra stops here fotus armor am I from Mount Drake cloud is going to be next if we're going to happen in Seoul this game which is the one that has the highest so that'll be pretty exciting to see when golden Guardians want to list of the college they may be the team kind of sitting on the back foot as TSM was in some of those first games are in the first game where you get free dragons I wouldn't be surprised to see if gold Guardian are the ones kind of looking more for that point wait till the second or third Dragon try to complete some of your major items and then use your ultimate combinations here between to the Galliano mordekaiser all these super powerful level 6 is try to make things happen that is a lot of time away from getting experience that doesn't mean he's going to be a lot less valuable at this point and also because he was going to roaming know that also means double does is missing from this Farm is the result where you know he has 3/4 so you got to play a bit more defense today. Looks like any of the phosphorus have
