at the end of the stick in North America Viper rookie challenge heard from the ladder they need some ice a 10lb came up around the same time they played a lot in the academy league and Diesel was always a guy that everyone talked about this guy is a huge shock collar for the team is always a big playmaker and he has been kind of The Shining Star this time around of the new generation of Academy players that have been moving up kind of have an endless supply of them but they did we're doing very well for himself with turtle in the bottom Liane V Quest as well I really do think turtle and JJ has been one of the most underrated do I was so far the twitreally good in the typical Jinks wife was a really ahead of the curve as far as adapting some of the new pic turtle was one of the early want to jump on it and they also were aware that really wants to jump on the split fluid stylist Jackson ribbon is well into bed opting for red side the specifically for Top Lane split push counter fix which river Sandpiper are the premier players of in this league is a little bit interesting that they do go blue but if you're not going to pick your match up then maybe you pick a support championearly so they still kind of lending some of that chords that type of style Play the song is played at zero games in the champ but it just as well as saving a a low ability Kerry talked about it a bit on the dive as well but I really enjoy a chrome right now to super fun jump even better top laner and licorice is a guy the FBI can even at Worlds to great success story based boxes for players from both Licorice and Viper over here in a sexy diapers most played number to hear for liquor has to certainly would you consider an option as they expensiveI want to do we know the time fans 99.9% is before Champion down there is he could grab it really amazing Nola block is a mid laner here for Paul to so if you last chance account before they can start throwing bands away I didn't work Midway Morgana is going to come through this very very strong is good in to the place I love you too and especially with this is adapt gain any sort of fresh-kill pressure because it's so hard vs. Morgana away is very easily if you can't really make a dent in her house then it gets frustrating for now it's funny as Morgana actually in bottling is an absurdly good trying to pick into reckon you can reflux Black Shield to knock up so I are saying is it that timebe right now Steven Knapp wife is still a very good pic so a minor self going to be there for JJ will see what followers come through as long as there's a decent chance Kentucky running is in the bottom leaving or waiting up like that around cuz I don't do it on a screen so there was also a chance that come through it still very flexible has play quite a few Mages in the bottom Lane definitely an option if you take Sarah's fan out here as far as being a little bit worried about possible combinations for Morgana bindings can't explain line up with that as wellis we get a little bit deeper though so far flight Quest there is looking very squishy vricon and recs I both been super squishy very quick at engaging so speed has to be on your side and once again which speeded what you're relying on it supposed to help that it's all about your execution I don't have the skill to pull that off so I'm going to wait the better flight unless we can't quite a few times last played it was the last year in North America open the option to put in another tank 1/3 Frontline ER is Orrin is the hover here again we're still on 9.5 not 96 which has the bus 244 will still be locked inbut now we will it be in sneaky where is Morgana going cuz I don't know for sure and I don't think they have much of an 80s rest so I'm expecting an attack damage Champion here because Darvon is generally going to go with the senator helpful to build we have not seen very many professional Jarvan Warrior are you go they deliver with an 83 thing up speaky to get as many Auto attacks as possible in a team fight attack the Cloud 9 bottom line here Tom kench drinks is not certain how do you thicken lamp and I'll be instead look like xayah rakan disconcerning Midland Mortgagepython can't do the same thing I can really love you have to blow things up to Super interesting as far as how much the early game does get tilted it in their favor if at all because I really have to see some mutual ground domination for this to be successful offensively rolling with were blocked one of the things I would want to do that or God I cannot do his work better with the jungler to go find Kilz on the enemy jungler because with lots of follow-up are usually doubled super high mobility and a lot of damage but it's not easy to land of in shouldn't even be able to hit those on something like a LeBron for you phora rest I even get his usual Dodge the way at the very least they can hit but it still blind out of everything elseKobe is going to be some value in getting a mortgage on a Cloud Nine West 4th place in regular if they win here today let's see what they can do putting me a preview of the semifinals of the LPS and to get ready to go on to the rift for Cloud 9 vs flyquest got a shout out my boy turtle though also sporting a new Bolta if beyond the player cans their style heading into playoffs with confidence it is a bold Choice here covid-19I just wanted to talk about this game thank you very much. It's a great to see you once again I have to say in your recent Buckley actually supposed to fall today are you mentioned in your mattress Team Liquid that you feel like you maybe didn't set the team up in that drop for a while so how do you feel you set the stuff that's BS though I thought we got a really strong the jungle and then a good top-line because they banned a lot of black counters or gladly encounters so we really strong team fighting we have a 131 and they're playing a Tom kench with a split pressure so I feel pretty confident about this draft and hopefully we can execute correctly on it thank you very much attached to the guys for the call definitely an interesting take care of it does rely a lot on the execution and the boy about Tom catch now maybe bad things about Tom camps that people don't often talk about because he's so good at a table and sweep with me and nabal and cross that plays within a team fight he often does get out done by a lot of other supports again if you're able to save the Jinx during the critical moments with devour then that's all the value that you really do need to supply for a five on five jumps and get out of here at the are then she can do damage after work that would be kind of what it up to and if you are really looking further ahead to the V on V so hard to out play ornn initiation was Darvon and a black shield plus devour surrounding a jinx so we shall see if they can pull it off okay well right here and we'll see if Midland pressure can make that happen to the ward off Gryffindor jumping in the guardian Shields been at the W but two flashes burned for just the one who spends Karen yeah I mean afterwards but for one flashes in the bottom Lane it will be a deficit there for JJ and wild turtle they won't be able to go as aggressive looking for kills maybe for pecans benefit at least you can still have a way out of turtle Physicians defensively and they do get gang stuff I have to Saving Grace E won't have the flash of games later on but won't be 6 before that comes back anyway so that's you do not think you just problems and maybe again turned around as likely not as you do get a bit of momentum force and foreign right the rest I get to take a shuttlecraft there's a huge Chunk on Spencer and tell if you have to walk around the top side to get his own spittle the to fight pretty close to their flag still get somebody image optical store still feel comfortable what's in a Cuban manifolds pretty close to equal how far is about the same as Wayfair continue to your furnace key all right with your Morgana matchup especially early on into the blog just trying to use the minions to your advantage vanderpool's down and how do I set off LeBlanc what you go through United States are good for burn the flash it didn't use it when trying to save sincere enough for you to be able to come down there that's going to look really good enough for black was definitely does it's likewise with a health lead in the bottom side plus they're the ones with the teleport on wild turtle so if they can chunk out Cloud 9 for sneaky into a recall situations they they gained a huge amount of experience you get more damage on that or you can get to replace with a quick reset open early game teleport or definitely ain't going to be able to use a summers bail Advantage after JJ Blended his towards the jungler Yahoo beginning like wasn't something that fight 3 got Lost Odyssey 9 sides with lots of all that is left once again look on the steaks near Flatiron secure the bi flag poseable Lockport seed with respective went to these beams we wait to see now what else comes through is this Top Lane as you heard in Brits say mention it all the blood in your lane counters are gone so they could play it safely right now. I'm supposed to equal but liquor is certainly have been a really jumped out of Latimer here yeah there should not be a world where on or never solo kills of Vladimir know it night or anything here and there's nothing really to be worried about for plaid you can sustain Perry easily spamming your cues farming up so you get a little bit of cooldown reduction as well and feeling for that late-game beats I got a jar pancake in the socks you boys are going to spot him coming through and around Pittsburgh shortly a kill and if they'll be taking over my fence care in electrical perhaps it's going to go to the jungler under the turret turret damage here without any information on Spence Karen who shows up at the perfect time there for 9 and they convert definitely a bit aggressive I'm going to punch them so now the game NC 9th and Cypress Hospital a centaur's. Regis. This one even think you're helping okay so the base is finally spotted it that do spend that's going to be just fine message if I spent scaring scaring will the LeBlanc get close enough I think it's going to be a little bit of damage given over to fighting right here Congress stacking up did not get the Lamborghini for damage out there spending jumps away in a war zone down killed nobody else is close enough here to really make that play turn into anything else it does mean that Morgana was drawn away from that Wave by the way that's pushing towards pobelter towards the leblancs of Oregon a missing out on a little bit of gas during the time of trouble going to land the first thing and rates what does he almost was going to live to Atlanta point-blank binding understand turn away comes in on the right side not enough to save his life devices 1410 gold not given over Saturday to fly and they miss out in the 160 there but it's still turret damage overall is weak Bots
