play receiver so Champion Select is beginning and we have a Nocturne in ergot ban in so thought you know what I'd like it's all I ever play man still available as far as the meat for the top side know so I kind of thought of Champions company has played yet also want to point out we are on pack 9.30 it does mean of course you have aatrox Nerf significantly still very good as well. North Americabut it is flexible first pick Silas it's always makes me think oh my God this guy must have put a lot of games on this island so much better if you already see the ultimate early 104 in the Midway is real that so combination is so powerful through mid leg and they're definitely back here in this must be the temperature back in here is well definitely a quiet song. This one has some very thin builds allowed as well I do want to keep going to be played by because Sunday to me is on Foreman has been for several games we had a couple of good games but have been having a slightly weaker split if they give it to him then we say hey we have faith you who you're ready to go but it's what I've seen on states are expected to go toweird if the other teams has already showing us an early silent that seems like a bad draft moves if you don't have the flexibility I think that the power has to come from that guesswork but we'll see what if life was going through it because you know if black was take some sort of bully talk later at like you Viper wants to play right to take a look here because that's why he already coming out to meet me at the more mail a Solunar deer especially Amelie Champions backup is done so well that makes melee kill Wayne really really powerful and I'm hopeful I really really song is bad so that's another option is just an additionturn on this line up so we know that it's not a bot Lane Zoe So Chase up a tablespoon of the Champions by for could have flavor seeing to Frontline pink fans and end Zach certainly is but when he got poached by Central in themselves to try to remove my nephew's aggressive options after divorce do it for the reasonably well but I'll wait to see what they actually want to fix themselves in the jungle roll and what's her last solo toppling Flex AZ to the Peoria van in there again they're kind of the same breed the a scoby that it's an aggressive melee top winter up there as well jets would really complement the Poke off that's already is do in Israel that would be a very impressive as far as the big game of an orange branch is bandwhat's a good yakult not even now on his lineup and what's it going to be before it's not there for aphromoo but a long time Jarvan jungle what's going to compliment Silas and the Jarvan jungle yeah I like making them so get him to Rome early I like it alot is a definitely a who he's special that will be someday playing sound of something that's offline and now Viper you seen the whole draft what do you fly I'm hoping Avril melee specifically though I really like this who he aurelion Sol pick again oh my God I'm so happy oh my goodness they have a squad moving with your Q Auto V immediately W to get yours done then would have been wanting you can stack up to more Fox Nowitzki get the last stuff you can swap your bow combinations with those who are actually insane we had to buy for an LPS school then asked me how many times has played Robin Hood over 10,000 and by the way he beat freaking a one-v-one down two levels and a caulfield's Warhammer fighting and it's going to be a whole bunch of fun here hundred earlier and now we got vipers ribbon on display simply in store for some firework it's going to be a whole lot of fun this one players already nodding is allowed to do that in the LCS and we're going to see again salad So Silent options for ultimate steals I was like going over those as well freak I think the best one probably the as real as well as the state Ronnie probably the best too cuz he does have a lot of Mobility to go for the islands with it as well these guys invite you said that we would only see vipers ribbon if he had to bring him out so what was it and soul and Tom kench and so if you're going to go for something with a lot of pressure in the side when it has to be something that's really mobile So Raven can get out of those situations really easily so now is the time to bring it out I think it's a really good game for it and I hope I forget to tell everyone why he's one of the best cops North America thank you so much and best of luck to you back to you guys really easily so I definitely agree with all the boys I don't know if it's going to be really easy to get out of an aurelion Sol Roman in a Bissell Voyage coming your way but Viper is the man to do it yeah he's a little sneaky like that so we'll see what happens we wait to go into this one yeah because he what he did with Academy last split ends with 28 Game season 18 game split as I get my numbers correct there either way certainly a strong performer he can be leasing top 5% so when you're on the Fred. caught up in the Piper pick your for ribbon but we can also go over the early game plans for both teams kind of setting this one up because it is super interesting right we've got booty in the mid language 1 Imports against Zoey super early on as the aurelion Sol her waveclear early was one of the nurse that they did a while back when there are try to take some power down from Zoe and so your idea for this composition for the early game is you get Huli roaming early and once you have your act Arrow use that as well try and pick somebody off and look for those early kills to start the stove on me while you seen this conversation a couple times Zoe and Ezreal scaling up for some milk composition in the mid game are going to be supplemented by like Amber was talking about a side lane Earth is going to be able to have pressure and high Mobility to get out of those rooms to go to poke compound one team is what is the opponents have just stopped is Topher to do with the Poke and you got Jarvan and Ash Steven Tom catches pretty good engage tools so they're definitely are ways in if something I can't even let you decide it's up to I think how you actually navigate them and play around them all right now we're seeing a lot of the Silas early Lane phase here someday doing the good job you want to leave an auto attack in between your Spell's veg out of the can unless it's so that one's going to hurt but he's getting the most of his way foot and that's why I try to keep her even under the turret Time Force Viper submissive dies that's where this early Tuesday athlete is coming from for Sunday that's not supposed to put as well you can hold on to your heel or Sunday on silence for those all in wait till you get below 40% for the big boost in healing and hopefully that will come in before the execute from Rivet ultimate you just need to hit that time and where we got to fight down to your voice and a funny when was enough to buy the space force intro in a grab that flew by and adipose didn't actually afternoon as well just make sure it's out of range and assuredly he's going to get it very close on the patient's pain that Grump butt time. Very well by 100 thieves and they will successfully steal away that camp now by the way on the does have three of his own to go back and farm the entire team should be calling out hit stage one he has literally nothing to go back to induce her jungle so she's going to be out looking for Wars at the very least right now and possibly a gank was this body right there as well so easy ping start to come down for 100 thieves and they can continue to track Santa for in WoW on the does Farm up the bread side jungle Anthony goes down to his friends right here I think centaurians read was that Grandpa's up and he's going all the way over to that there's the voices are available in wants to know if top Wings important or not seems like it's going to be to be walking around and going to that camp so pretty solid a hundred things I need to buy this game is very very close throughout the early game farms trading for deeply and wait to see you in the side then pushes might happen to meet you after somebody left it down here if you want the minions and we'll stay pretty close to equal to buy perform here yeah I mean it's nice to see that he's playing appropriately and we see the communication right under wants to cement his lead in the jungle and keep those numbers up for his bottom side clear so they say are weak side is topside someday yes know you've been pushing the wave but play safe now and he backed off let's Viper push it in and they get to reset here that doesn't mean that Viper it's a very nice recall though early Executioner's I love being this utility buy for himself that burst healing were talking about presilah coming in below 40% he might fate himself because if you're relying on that and ribbon has the ultimate up and executioners is on you to be executed ever so come through. Scott Ellis and I'm going to push been torn out get to The Knockout of body block the Q events, it's really really difficult to try and get your Giants iguana model out of the body of any other drunker than trying to body but you just impressive and it is absolutely willing the jungle match up right here in German besides wanting and you can see the gold difference over a hundred the XP they've certainly there as well as 5 verses that gets fairly 5:00 so it's not too bad on that one but it's early and having a great time is early going to be really good stuff not a huge surprise really good job coordinating with his team and moving in with the driving for fracture we talked about the bottom Lane one app remove want to go to hell come out as well and that is how you need to play the jungle in the early game that was definitely a team objective and now we're to the point that we also alluded to where the aurelion Sol roaming and the ashes approaching level 6 that is the key to look for kills because even if you lose your ass here just in your own lane and not looking for the super long-range one that's how you get the lock down to the I get an actual first Blood be there are three p's on the side of flyquest currently since they did have his spell book teleport on and Central in spotted Once More by been pushing enough to be a couple of plates down this Autumn Lane to place already gone so 300 extra gold game that bottom Lane and that's looking pretty solid this duel links going pretty well pretty effortless BF to recall for ashes Wells that's going to be an ie Rush funny really damaged available there and it's just Turtles the least I can just hear I really like you to control a top bottom side 100. Do they have so much pressure with this ash Tom canceling constantly at the tower that was a couple to go towards you should give yourself an early Dragon Mountain Drake going to help them away at the places they've already gotten two of on the bottom side through the vale doing so much work early game this is also going to make the next Drake respond quicker I make you continue to try and control this area Connecticut look at top sides only five Cs difference with somebody's holding on to this I guess you can call the counter pink eye blind. And I forgot Last Choice and he just stacking armor to survive he went grass to get better to stay in and he's so far doing pretty well that one will wait to see you later on who can Team fights book was better but this is been pretty par for the course for the equal to like yeah I mean to me is a lot for what they want to do the composition like if it was talking about later in the game Super mobile for fresh ringside lands early on Lanes been going pretty close to even hear jungle fracture you know we talked about on do is doing a lot of invading their butt no fireworks not just yet hours later I believe it after a few months but I think it's going to come through at some point and it's time it's some days trying to push the rest of the way then by purple
