Spurs playoffs however they can shake up their seeding if life was when they lock exactly for that they get spice collection in their quarter-final Golden Gardens if they win will tie flyquest hybrid Queen of the day we are the champions league game playing definitely have been a big trade you for Echo Fox and they have been focusing on that Lake in but I really do feel like people are not giving enough credit to frog in LeBlanc an assassin play as well I think it's been quite a good I think the main factor though it's contracts giving some early pressure to that lane has been a lot of success were golden Guardians meanwhile toppling for Viper has been a Hotpoint people advanceone of the most band Champions vs flyquest ribbon is also ties with play right now another meeting that way for quite a while at the contract early founding of being a big factor in Golden Gardens wind there have not been any Jungle Band so contract and get his pick of the litter right here we saw his Kindred yesterday but today is the game jungle are here not a big surprise for contracts wants to go super hard with the gangster Leon Rex eyes a perfect Camp you to do that scale that well as far as looking forward to late game but they also have locked in tandem here with a Tom catch one of the best before it's at pushing through the mid-game Abyssal Voyage to such a big pool for professional play Olay as soon as heyou can try and take another Lane you can try and go on with your jungler and we'll see if the Devourer becomes a very big part of their team fight as well they're going to be excited to see what kind of backed Runner comes to read still thinking fight comps for frog and definitely are the best of the day for Golden Guardian eprom coming in here for flat foot support how to counteract that Tom kendzia now it's going to be seeing that a Nocturne might indeed be another high Mobility camping around the map and honestly, I can what time Kent tells your story even with either team picking one of their they're toppling are yet for a possible split push fit getting Tools in preparation for the showdown between Oscar and Viper how did you mention Nocturne also very good at attacking and defending when the map is spread out very similar to Comcast has come through here for deftly I feel like you got your pixel it here bottomliners entirely in both ears to get bug pics to help my daughter are genetically stronger ones especially when Brom can block you and not sure exactly make your life difficult embarrassed requirement extremely good at getting back to Marksman that has no dash or just to get away. So there's definitely going to be difficult for him I would say that maybe he will go The lethality build and price spike really early on in the game and if that isn't a combination you do with a successful recti pass early on that it could be a lot of a pronoun for the really came here for a chance that there is Place Midland and if somehow a good taking the left and right I don't think it is but we seem verra said before so who knows I'm getting dropped off the table of course LeBlanc and reply Quest Facebook talking something aggressive to go out from Viper or pobelter top Light Up and Away in his life westside of Vladimir Lenin's dropped off and I think this is a good top laners possible here for the Golden Gardens already showing the various in recti lot of a d damage they're going to need some AP so that fly Quest won't pick up you know laugh tank or something they're having the itemization is but we know what Sonic and close that Gap and this is a huge backline source of damage for frogging in this could be golden Guardians looking for a Audi build for varus build super long-range different damage types of those things combined quite well I think I'm curious then if it's going to the core four of the fog what's that fifth ever going to be will it be coming in to join or is going to stay to the side light and heat Viper busy the first pick time Kent makes me think that it's going to be something of a 4-1 and it will be a split Champion solo has by Hunter off on the other side and then the poor rest of them threw up there with the mid pressure and Tom can't do kind of go-between veriscan with his extra range do some decent things are in the bottle and she will come through for her as well I believe you aatrox she comes through here I think either way home so comfortable in the one I want up there and keep the point of busy yeah it's not necessarily going to steal into a split butcher like we might have been thinking with a Tomcat spin doctoring floating around right minor I have to take one of the most annoying thing to deal with as Alessandra The Claw is very predictable you know exactly where lysandra is coming in and unless she instantly has black very easy for the land that silent and you can come combo that was quite well to the main tank for a team are still shots it's not guaranteed. Point-and-click so they might need to set up maybe a flash taco from rex or just good play and getting your are we still Trust first time of the year here for a frog and and show gas almost through the first of the year. Winter gear joins the squad has launching Nocturne for Santora's going to be in adult size as time goes on a quest in Golden Guardians doing battle throughout the day laughing locations are here at the end of the game started at the waist two playoff teams already qualified going at it early let's see what we can get here stopwatch on the side of santorin as well as froggen and JJ always count your stopwatches early on in the game and there was might be the sites of tower Dives all right so as they Square Off way to go in the playoffs if you need a way to wrap one of these teams heading to class make sure to check out the official jerseys on LCS merch.com you can be super fanned out for the postseason they will see you in St Louis and you'll be wearing pretty pretty colors and remember the changes that you mention in 9.5 for cho'gath or simply EZ damage increase on the vorpal spikes a little bit of extra flat damage so those Autos will be a little bit stronger helps out with a wave clear as well pretty meaningful by fax I think so that's a viable and good to see him back around now I've been waiting to see what kind of Tanks would show back up in the medicine show. One of the first ones to reappear but if you're a mage in fighter heavy up there it's funny you mention that cuz I have been talking to so many of the top players and teams as well and I've heard a lot about Malachi but we still haven't seen him picked Malachi and hack ROM and I got in a lot of starts out as I definitely but certainly a health leave there for black was it back a little bit there but that's going to be a nice little start to the Lane for wild turtle and JJ especially with the ROM Lucian that's going to go a long way Tom kench is the one that you want to Target pretty San Elijo top of your for definitely if you land the eagle the attack speed right afterwards and push first we'll still go to Golden Guardian style be slightly under the Blacklist her but there's room. If you need to call me simple clear in this mid-length clear for the early stages definitely do you have good that up on both sides by the way then trekked I can Flash in for an odd stuff followed up by Adele cardstock up it's the jungler sitting at the mid laner meanwhile the other side is the one that has to set up for Nocturne but she definitely has a very easy time of doing that so that's why you can see frog and has taken cleanse on the vel'koz as well if there is at initiation frontal Belfair he's got a couple ways out right now small dips for Hunter here in this Lane as many more minutes to kill and help our little bit low hasn't proposed yet but will have the same backup is life is bullying a little bit up here now one of the biggest things for cho'gath and kind of the break-even points for cho'gath lanes are can you believe them enough early to keep them off the minion way did you get so much distain through finishing off those minion rapper doing a pretty good job here of keeping Han Solo and a couple his minions have died as he's trying to Auto attack in the air is nice except it was an awful and it's worth and 60s you dropping out loud by not last hitting now Santorum and topside again I have felt oh God is a gay couple Champion specially of knocking behind him there's just enough Runway eyeglasses are ready yeah NACA pins weather for this week in Cabool it's for sure gangable I thought it was going to go on The Knockout but if they see him he all they needed in as a little bit of vision right now to know that he's still in this way must be careful okay rent in midlane person easy possible to make sense a but now it's been topside he is so far away there should not be but he's not walk to the world's longest possible but patience pays off for stand for in Camp there for the top laner Viper is able to get a lead in the lane and Stan torrents able to get to kill money on Nocturne which will fund the early Warrior enchantment for more cooldown reduction is damage behind your ultimate this is going to be huge doctor in the champion that can definitely snowball very effectively looking at these Lanes cho'gath No Escape frogging on the eval tattoos Summoners wordscapes as well as above so lanes are very very good Nocturne targets is half of these right about the all-in coming in so I chose a very risk-averse play but now one left photograph him that sun while and that will be a living there at the help why not quite low without a few to get back to Lane yeah I really like how you want to devour before the last Auto comes in so that damaged doesn't go off the practice and go off if you don't always want to wait for the sea sea to land and then take them out of the TC has denied them damage there while turn on JJ though still very solid hold on this bottomland pushing up and that means easy dragon control for stand for in the topside driving does go down to get that Global reach and you'll know that the Nocturne is there an app that you can see on the mini map is already headed up towards Viper black was aatrox and no Wards play it's going to be anything to get out of it they do get the flash but they know that they have lost the objective bottom sides does turn into a mouse in Draper flashlight pretty worthwhile I'll burn a flash for a drake you to Mountain one or Leon and I'll frog and look at this boat out they're not going to play Klaus up so there's no easy day going to find a q's plug in the comment but that's all CF going pretty evenly created in the mainland as well neither of them tonight too many to the tower fairly close in wave clear during the early stages but we're now hitting level two sixes for both of these men liners and the kill pressure is definitely they're definitely going to keep an eye on the jugular special that experience bar for Centura naddy just get the night is Wolfgang contracts on the way out there after stealing it and it's not go as far as match-up is concerned it is a 400 Gold Leaf straight up for santol in here but you expect in the first place I beat the farm difference is negligible get the same CFO also going to kill up there so more efficient to run Power Rangers number two or three jungler nna the split and looks like it remember also the dragon giving you significant gold now too and with a cam definitely helps a lot when you want to go for team objectives but you don't want to fall behind now you don't really have to concede anything just takes a lot longer than killing chickens will timing yep contracts definitely have a lot of births potential once hitting level 6 with Nocturne I eat does that flash ready and has gone conqueror so there's a huge amount of damage output that's possible he just need to get it into a lane and convert and I want to commend golden Guardians Early Learning despite the first Blood the 600ex for gold that's life ghost Tavern it's a tide game in Gold overall very well-informed the bottling up 15 as well even a slight difference in at 7 early on so these lanes are going well you can make you talk without really getting a lot of it is that the discrepancy in the bottom Lane definitely an old lady getting the last it's on minions even though every time we've Pan the camera over that land turtle and JJ have been the ones pushing and of course of Lucien bromwick one of the most aggressive in its various you will and you haven't really heal burn four reasons because of that match up but still holding off and I would say the eyes have been on this bottom line probably the most critique aspects of the go
