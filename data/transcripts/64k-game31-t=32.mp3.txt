more of a sample size from this number one PCS I was very impressed I have a say in particular by Bruce and Mission we're just farming like absolute monster as soon as they were forming something like 12:30 at for a minute against Team Liquid which is just ridiculous it was like to Z levels hope dies so I'm really interested to watch them as soon as you two are the heavy favorites for this grouping in assuming is looking to clean up some more wins here after they want to such a close game against you too and what the hell is just with the win of teal over GT with means I win hair ties you prefer the group based on the record so far it has been good enough make it happen here as well only a couple of Carrie Topolino's coming out on the Machi side we'll see if maybe the jacks or something comes down that was a bigplay for a bit earlier here as well and I want to see the Jack looks like of course for protecting is there have been some concerns about PK and doesn't really focus on helping him out so it is to us play Championship Justin band are they are on the right side of the couch trying to say because Pick 4 last of my she doesn't usually do that they regularly prioritize mission who is kind of their big star player he is a guy who's a very very strong laning bit later he doesn't have a lot of activity on the map that generally speaking but he creates big Pharma advantages and he pays that back by putting out big-time out the damage in the team fights sofm going to grab the nidalee he played this I believe against Team Liquid yesterday was massively ahead of rocks up on nearly doubling his farm and we'll see if he can put on another huge performance year against Gemini and and marchingRock summer split still a chance in the people were looking at their nidalee definitely a high prize Evelyn and Lilia would be kind of the next in the tier list if you're looking at Gray's Italy being feared want to do you want two magic damage juggler that's kind of that will be that comes through for Gemini or not regardless polar bear is more likely to be a jungle pick here just my intuition base in the garage so far and we still come through for real though they both him and Gemini have your 5 take place on the champion so has been pretty common for both and it is the third most played 4pk with his most played Champions already being banned out by Tim hinh I wouldn't be shocked if they just wanted to secure this to try to protect him a little bit in the draft because they said they usually are lock picking for Mission they're trying to protect him as much as possible will be interesting to see if Ben wants to take something that he considers to be a bit of the counter picks try to go for an aggressive matchup against BK because I found love to play out there and Jacksonthe volunteer stunt Mountain Auto attack that Q is blocked by Counter-Strike I'm so it is actually very very easy to prevent that you evolve there goes into like his running stance other things very clear animation Templar can react to that and prevent it. This could be a Flector the jungle now that Jack's been locked and you could go to wear something like the shed I do like that both positively and just kind of doesn't idea to try to protect BK a little bit more I think that Jack has a better match up your brother has a better match up in Two Jacks and you don't have to win that one be one right you can just kind of withstand it you can build some wave clear and try to make Place Elsewhere on the map I think that is probably going to be the game plan here for PK and just shows the powers of flex pics there a little bit because I do believe that Jack was locked in really hasn't answered of all there has been a good drops play Kieran and I'm curious how the game's going to play it because we know it's unless you're doingclear plates than into waves and then come back at the headlines or by the way up an item on you in this was done dusted so I will do that for him his rookie year in the LPL sitting top laner if you speak Mandarin. Wrong with Carlos but a banth with throughout the bottom Lane right now you can see the porch with Ajax Carrie filla composition of the song self double band on that side I mean while yet is there any planets out of Mission to call leave and away we don't know what the Middle Lane answer to Angel Center is going to be but he is most to go to call Ian van zuylen off and we coming through as well and Echo is something that I don't know if Mission would really go through it you didn't actually play it regionally but you know he could go to something like his Zoe is Oriana of those two have been pretty problemfor him abandoned house on his kind of those those AP matchups mortgage Pacific counter you know kassadin would be pretty risky pic I think you again soon in who can play so fast but that is going to happen. Regardless in your really building towards just 535 late game of this was one of the common picks Forum it and it does kind of fit is play solidly said he's looking to farm it out to the war is the team fights where he is really really good and they have built already a very beefy Frontline with their what we are assuming our shopping and jungle radical equations for in all this but we're not really going to consider that for now and locking there and a lot of the only reliable and Gage is Sword Art playing for freaking ever he's such a better in here in the lineup but he's the only one with a son that's a longer range in the sky of the week and that one's only so good meanwhilebut if I forget the lead in top link you just play around the 131 you play split and that will be hard to deal with exactly like okay we're going to go away from the Jack Bright of a strong to Stand United onto to go in to work on comes in Qualicum pop the ultimate get the stand United to try to fly in and Harden gate on Champions such as the syndra to pick them off while Jackson is Eileen trying to create Avengers that's what they're really looking to do and we'll see if they are going to be able to rate those types of advantages or if doing or going to be able to really just escalate the lead instop playing no pick up the pace in the early games we thought it was Ben actually playing and he was like weeks the Jackson still beer and Ben and that's what band has been one of those deadly object will combos in the LPL are they can snowball almost any Lane it feels like so Geminis going to have to do a good job protecting pk-2 I'm always going to be in Port here as yeah there's a lot of really volatile Lanes right there right now in Midland is there pretty close back and forth Michigan some decent trades with his soldiers that ain't looking good job for the night's shield in to trade for PK means you got a small healthfleet up there has been go through his first couple of oceans thanks. That should say he could find a regen back up through his door and shield been trying to do here is he's actually destroying a hard shove these early waves so that it'll bounce and on the time and he expects Gemini to be up on the top side the wave will be pushing forwards it what that lets you do is just sit back and play it more defensively. If you can get it to crash you know the weight is going to come to you if you don't have to expose yourself at 2 at Aunt Polly Bergen and Candy types of things they also spotted Hawk Shop coming through from Bruce to full knowledge of where he is Gemma is heading up towards the top side but I'm the wave does not look like it was actually able to get that Full Bounce in make it right away clean as you say it never had a chance of flash away on the checks that was really well done there quick Counter-Strike came out for Benny was trying to trade a resume to PK pushing that Wave 3 didn't have any Vision know he had no word for himself in that River and despite the fact that you possibly stock jumped away PK follow up with the flash on the top flash nails that Gemini flashes in chains that also been couldn't get over the wall that was just very well done and good lean management here from PK to not allow the crash come through tonight wow that reset to happen and I've been getting punished for being very overaggressive something that a lot of people were saying should have happened to him in that TL game and did not this time he able to punish have a good talk flash to follow of course it was to flash with a kill then see if he's back in and he's in for the Scott the longest word from his farm and plug back in late and we'll see when PK makes his recalls going to be now he's really Crystal DK's up Ruby Crystal and down a flash if there's going to be more action later on that's the only difference in his Lane so far cuz he only got the assist there then put in that much farther ahead but I. Is blade plus the boots come in here for Gemini means he is really ready to go for round 2 and not spot it so if it messes up at all here I should be fine there you go you can Counter Strike that Halle Berry son did she kill off the war to eliminate any chance of using that out for elite strike again later on little bit of pressure doesn't really matter now or later on if you can turn that into a completed item because you're the actual thing you get from these potions is going to be more valuable than 255 HP fuel from a ruby Crystal you get a full tick ocean you see how he is never more like 5 600 Health once I thought exactly. But yeah, but without the dark Zone without putting a Counterstrike means he will be gone before and Ben cat show back up the train comes through with the counter was bullying and Top Lane is over beautifully done there by PK and Gemini so he walks Point Blank and that's exactly what you want to do and it's a lot of cases what people do is to watch Point Blank not hit the Jacks then he Parts his Counter-Strike then you tan after in this case he saw he was right Pointe Blank on the Range and it says you know what fan you can tree activist and Ben doesn't flash it don't get the Counter Strike Up and as a result he has been dismantled in this Lane there was a lying on him for the split push and this is a dominating we from Achi not just because of the gold but because of how this competition is supposed to function it revolves so heavily around Bend being able to win the sidelines and now he's going to get there but I want now look at that time looking at the recall that once I'm just got he went cold here just sidestep koala what a beautiful kill with a 17 Millie's actually he's been worse despite how well toppling has been going your massive CF Advantage Plus he's the one that got the kill we have to remember that she didn't actually get either of those killed both of them went to the nursery while it is still very beneficial to shut down at Jack's it's Gemini who's got to try to make the most of the girl that did get dumped into him from it will see how much you guys going for a depressive starred in in a matchup that again know they are are really considered big underdogs here I want to bring up the fact that to your Cole what's the recall from one phone which means they had $1,300 and was like I'm sailing where I'm going to sacrifice all the controls and let you do whatever you want to me hear Bruce whenever he wants to can shove in the wave take a like 2,000 gold recall if you back in and we weren't CP that should be a drink I want to see Maji they haven't bought do they have in top length that I agree you know what one of the things is because Joe and I spent so much time outside they obviously haven't been able to do that yet now maybe they feel like you're in a spot we can start playing two words besides you know if you go towards that dragon now you have stayed United Jack's can't match with you pee so I agree I think that would be a really nice way to play it if I put some pressure on where to get a replay of what was the social long-range god of the week he knew we had it the orbs route immediate flash through when he saw that Skyler week was going to land pops the out the angel very well played on that one be one I like the PK is also not going for the Sunfire just build straight towards the Titanic that is going to help you maintain your lie in the 1D One for quite a long time because you have that big gold leaf at the 426 pasta try to be even larger lead marches going to be outside cuz injectors going on before the Jackson friend truly just want to do something to you say the S Logan call Tiara is really just hang out we're scaling where to play for late Jack's want to get those items are going to wait for that and I taken orally dragons you're putting a little bit of time with the right thing alright challenge at the Third Dragon so in x amount of minutes you're going to have to come here and meet me in and fight for it they don't do that they can just got to continue to extend their gold leaf butt yeah we could just be suiting every time you go to Dragons if you wait too long just ignore it in farm for gold hardside step there and it actually means that you'll have to give up on the roof. There was well as it's going to be as beer Recall now for mission is honey still down 14 lbs in the book getting pushed in. Going to be some Farm denied do not going to hold us back to can missions actually okay I've got to walk back all right just just just got the way and I'll be there don't worry about it as the Staffing people are coming through for Bruce he is going for the more engage style here and he certainly is erc20 get damaged in a mid to late game team fight so it's right there going to have to be the team
