play into this a lot of people are predicting EG but there's no guarantees do you know we've seen so many upsets throughout the season and honestly I don't think that any team is so far above another besides cloud nine right when you take them out of the equation a most of the rest of the league was very comparable as far as strength eegee's getting a lot better towards the tail end of the split but I'll be really interesting to see if I can figure something out for this Best Buy because best of 5 truly is a different Beast then best of one that they can get picked in advantages if they have something figured out that try to shut down to do K then hey it can be completely different ballgameit was cool as well as your teams with the new playoff format for the Springfield of 20/20 lies if you lose hear you fart lower bracket you can have the chance to fight through there if you win you probably facing them down light of the first one doesn't quite work though obviously kudos for the pot for placement to have a a Deep Run available but also in the best-of-five teams that if they get a chance to adapt to play out to self and keep the Run going so going to be really interesting not see a ribbon Banner as if I could pick that we can't wait to see if you would pick up for himself right now this Tavares and looks like at the walk in there to play a truck the cops I will be locked in. But we haven't actually more set flexes lately it has been showing up sometimes as a support is sometimes as a jungler Champions Squaredue to the fact that it really do struggle into a lot of fart DC yeah I definitely important there right now we've got some more going on as there is a course just going to be like this that is a flexing list of likes Too Faced Mala champions of the top slide once you can fight away generally speaking is going to be able to kite out of Sabian B8 Rock take things like that so I can look really good I might very well see that's best for that said jungle and it could even be there right like that could actually be the following is a strong combo it does allow said to play very aggressively to use his abilities to go forward with kind of the safety net of once he gets very low after uses Haymaker and in that Shield expired I can pull you back out and somewhat reset the fight this is a combo life unit number of times and I'm I'm very interested from the CD draft because I do think I had a lot of flexibility could just be standard rolls you know. Bought your set-top of this could be set for this could be cool if the top is a lot of flexibility they have here going forward where is like what's drafty with pretty cut-and-dry you kind of feel like you know where everything is going to be going expecting a chocks to be top expecting Pantheon to be in that jungle there's a slight possibility of it going there but it doesn't feel like a power of evil type Champion so I'm not really expecting that to be the case yep our people is the highest damage from the mid laner in the league and if not by playing Chivas campeon it's the victor of the Oriana the Zoe and they're going to be coming through and honestly just keeps throwing out support bands cuz they've got a strong one for themselves already in the sets again doesn't have to be there not likely but I mean can happen but yeah wait to see what I see is going to come through so I can support you need at the Port they most likely need a bit later you sing them drop with lectin which means that they just listen might be bought Lane in ticket to pick to say in a Ray Liotta actually quite a lot I am expecting that they think Top Line has not been picked that they are thinking ciclista is the bot Lane and the Top Lane remains to be chosen Kathy Van coming through a couple bands have been thrown the way of the zoo k a couple bands have been thrown the way of power of evil now here to do with the Casio and the sintra to a lot of these mid laner. take off table rise door bands that are really big pick their a40g flyquest obviously Victor is available if they want to go for something relatively high damage but it does look like before can be locked into everything pretty standard size of Blacklist they will be saving middle encounter Pick 4 last trying to get power of evil at advantageous match up against Suzuki as we all know it's going to be so important to shut this guy down because he has been very very dominant in the last couple weeks F-16 four-and-twenty across this year of the first 15 minutes probably not getting shut down early on but if it does that's going to be really here going to be locked in as the real support those that will indeed be in the Top Line electric Monell's fancy going on like this again don't expect that that a question is is it going to be closed down there I think I passed to do but I'll see what you've played so much of in the last month drive is locked in for Jitsu kids going to feel real to them like was could just go with something like Victor if there's going towards the more standard Stylo pics Oriana is traditionally considered fairly good matchup interide also I am really interested to see what life has prepared though is it going to be something special deals here and other fairly standard pick your someone that does out razor ride the can actually look do push him in in the early levels to try to scale alongside him but not the one that really does matter turn the side lamp later on so not any sort of spicy, Victor has been prepared the rise was pretty easy to foresee based on how the draft have been played out of it does give EG again that comfort for UK and while he may not have party in Midland early on he is going to be the strongest Island camping in the game Uno come 20-30 minutes later on he's got to worry about Pantheon do it again and that maybe have the wrinkle that like wet pass to try to shut him down that it's not just a one-v-one did you have to worry about against Viper it's at to be one with Center adult again and trying to really shut him down well the new shaping coming out of the draft for flakowitz is the azir it's his age played all-time midliner so I think so does have them for him on that camping across his career by comparison 70 Oriana games there is a difference but a backline team fight Mage with room for playmaking with the srimad shuffle can definitely work out fine for him should be very exciting to watch as that plays out ultimately this game is about ready to go it's going to be very exciting I can't wait to see who's going to take down game 1 in this best-of-five to see you soon welcome back to the game playoff have begun here in the LCS and it is Evil Geniuses in the blue side flyquest on the red easy as top seed get side selection and they could not be chosen by Cloud Nine thinking of that Squad scene on could shoes if they want to play flag was first round it said no give that one away the team that scene was more afraid of here was flyquest and they are no Evil Geniuses opponents let us have been locked in and discuss the Bible answer man who moves on to the second round the upper bracket and I'm really excited for it Eric coming out here alongside the coolest of is the combo we have seen showing off a couple times it is very very strong you can can have some really nice interactions with that Tarik ultimate allowing as we sought you out Flay you know while ago we seen another Martinez play it so you can kind of have this Terror go in fairlea aggressively and then as he gets low he gets pulled out in that Calista ultimate straight into a terrible to be coming out after that so you can kind of time that out so you have a long kind of string of immunity obviously it also allows you to throw in the Tarik aggressively giving him some more consistent engage options to have that Knock Out Of The Knockout brother time straight into a Dazzle sun which does for the increase the reliability of that cuz it can be fairly difficult otherwise to against the Moore mobile champion definitely can be so we'll see if those targets can line up well but as you mentioned that's a really good really really really good length energy I deftly luckless to tarek a lot for a kind of all the reasons you mentioned and just yeah it's you have a wonderful day pushed in the very lightly in the Midland start this one out as a Viper surprise is starting here in the series he's not pulling the Rhythm band Squad doesn't seem to matter really do here is like no he's to be better for the team sadistically and faith in the eye test IQ. Solo was the better fit but that is a situation of like to put themselves in to take it to be the better choice and help me find their prerogative the album some of the players better than I do from the beginning that I've seen it got all those weeks and months of Screams to look at for data because it's not a visual thing is communication right and in that goes beyond just communicating what's going on your land sometimes it's positivity and, sometimes it's someone who has good ideas of place to make when you're behind door intangibles that you know it's kind of hard as a spectator to really know about or understand a Santorum though moving around here on Zouk a potentially was looking for thing for just a Raptors today but not going to be available in the topside won't be too much fun for Viper in those early level set really does bully out the heat rocks any kind of extended malate I pray that you are taking is going to be going fairly heavily in your favor couples beers can Mendes have the reason for the time to rent out so no extra damage dealt to wild turtle there but really push going into the flyquest sideboard drop-down zombie comes out after it's been staring to keep clearing right now he's going to be about a camp ahead is the two jugglers trade scuttles back and forth on the other side of the map so nothing to it doesn't happen in the early game quiz recall thumbs down for the rise for a quick tear to buy that as soon as possible to fast you can stop at the more damn you get pretty nights it is really nice and honestly getting that the archangels stacked up and having that if Shield as an additional defensive Summoner really does make an enormous difference for some of these kind of need to range type Mages such as we rise you because you are exposing yourself to taking a lot of damage to be able to be in position of being raised to deal lot of damage it really is invaluable and completely can change the types of fights are able to take so getting that stack up and ready to go as early as possible is really big and that's why I think it was just a smart move Force been scaring to move towards midlane help him push that out so they can get the recall without actually having to commit atella for it and now he's going to be in a pretty comfortable position here against our people who hasn't been able to get a base off yet if you can block power of Evil under his Tower you can perhaps Force out of TP and then create an advantage and just threw that that could be really big deal especially yeah if you can bet every able to withstand the start of this is Lane pressure and still has some of them an approval to give us till seven soldiers and fight for land controlled by which Kazuki take an extra car then again starting without this wave is crashing in the mid lane. It'll kill the ward first was going to be a little bit slow and crashing it but there should be some forms okay mrs. I see which of the ambient gold and made a CD back to Lane with an extra sapphire crystal and Sebastian Potion do you have a good way to burn flash flood comes through the Wilds of the bottling works out great really well done there by Viper finding the opportunity for that early TP play jazz UK had just use his back to Midland so they knew that was on cooldown Rise was not going to be able to respond and cool had not yet Beastie was in a great spot to do it but I sent or incomes in ignore going forward Viper does arrive Brom had gotten out of a sack down allowing them to proc that Braum's done and turtle the one to pick up that first Blood best person there to grab it so fly quest to be feeling really good it does cost quite a bit actually in the long run on the top side though because been scared is coming to actually proxy him out into a simplest and in between the turrets is on him off that way so not only is he losing their initials yes he's losing plates to yeah I feel like I'm almost Nutri wave and 320 gold earring for to place the first flight is 600 that that difference has made up pretty quickly keep mine to kill was on vasil not on bangs Okaloosa was able to I believe still stay around bottom Lane through the wave is needed not missed you much compared to Turtle so bored is reflecting a fairly close game overall East Molly to fly Quest I going to need to kill is a little more than that farming play it was worth it especially think it's better on verot than on satvinder even more there that's not on the scoreboard and the day flag look at their bottling control also get to go to this rate on credit to them for being able to actually pull this off whilst that was on a reset and while he wasn't actually in a position to try to confess that because then the next thing that I was going to bring up is you know yet as far as gold it goes fairly even but it could actually be detrimental to flyquest if then your top cleaner has no TP indeed you can set up for Dragon play bike with no take away that option and have now it'll kind of nullified that Advantage somewhat because Top Lane TV is not going to mean as much if there are no place to be had really are on this bottom side alrighty well right back out of map we go is the resets come through me no Rift are responding very shortly a lot of time we will see teams swept their bottom and the top side to fight for it or at least roam the work over if nothing else at the 83 sold out so I want to see you back under pressure before too terribly long black comfortable spot
