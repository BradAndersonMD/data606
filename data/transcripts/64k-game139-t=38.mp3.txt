completed the first round robin and sadly these are two of the very bottom jeans EOD alone in last black West hydrate a relatively Rock run at it and they're needing to find Improvement the last Fusion Academy game I cast with actually against liquid Academy and they had so many opportunities to win versus like Zoe who grabbed a chilling Smite off a minion to steel dragon soul need to find ways to generate the trees but I'm looking forward to watching black West because like personally revenge is a player I have my eyes on all along with triple like those stolen or triple for being that great opl import revenge is because she was like any solo queue star from a couple years backgo to say was already like half so far already playing a he was playing up from Canada with you notes you know 55. Ready to take it to the second round robin let's goLil Boosie celebrity like I'm through a couple games ago and do it a lot of times Academy metal will end up pre-empting LCS met a little bit curious you going to get your thoughts on what atoms approach to be with you but I kind of funny cuz when I was casting FaceTime games we started seeing you and then I'm like it's kind of weirdly like refreshing to see you again cuz it's different and then after watching the games I like and that was fun we won't be seeing you again right yeah you also way more bands and pick us rocket would like the number to Hyatt present stop later at like 75% pick ban right it was 6 pick up game just just pick like once every 18 as well as another MF models do with a fight Up Against Time and people wanting to matches with like an H rocks or more for mordekaiser it's like this fine Night Champion pool that are at least not a counter but like serviceable and Orange Ranger locking it in early and then they're also making sure they're locking in there Duos cuz it seems like the jungle and support pools are by comparison actually smaller but I called the wrong Poppin Poppin bought bought pools are smaller than Jungle pools so they're more okay with the jungle absorbing a second phase of a baby like set is that extra tier above the organ that like that like that Dennis first alarm Jack weirdly Ya Head Up Pretty Ricky like almost never make both through you're going to do take that you're okay and we're going to go fight that with more damage and they're always Banning or is that it just ends up that you know only one is ever available LG side-by-side Emma share with us and he's above their bot Lane in this regard to take a look very good I have been I have a car payment plan for when I'm going to spoil here because you're awesome I don't necessarily like people staying like after his at least you cried this game Let's watch this highlight reel compressing are and sure and he's like yeah whatever your carpet else are like the important thing is press are at the right time like sure are is really powerful and sometimes it feels like you can just swing by pressing on but it has a very steep win rate increase as MMR increases as cartas is incredibly still expressing the pet for this is there's a playtester who was really good of carthus last season and really knows how to Jungle him and I had Kim record a note Schleich practice tool full clear he didn't in 3 minutes and 4 seconds is a mattress I part so he's place give me different 130 by the way I like a side-by-side comparison I talked about called I was going to talk about all the like Auto or Auto tax in you need to tap your e so you're not bringing too much Mana but also watch I was prepping this I went back and looked at all the folk artist game it is pretty rare that you actually get a full clear on karthus cuz either this is what I seen actually either the carthus will start at enemy Red and then take Raptors and then like Zoom through is jungle to get like a hard tonight cuz he's still fast or the other team will preamp the invade because they know that no one can keep up with the Carthage pool clear and also to do the proper car this will clear you get pretty low so it is a little bit vulnerable based off of this open though maybe we'll get to see frog races for clear and we can we can time it I got some break points in my head for what like good looks like I'm ready to see them when I come through. If this is the if this is going to make them as well so it looks like he's going to keep key if he's doing it right he'll make it to this part of the river by 2:15 so let's yep let's let's get this going on karthus all right it's 1:30 and I know an LCS cool down I don't like can you navigate to Target dummies in and use their opening else I want Cartman Speedway how fast can you get level 5 you can gain Time by cute you can Skittle the crop as the blue is almost dying and you should actually be pulling the Grump down towards his Lowe's right now and already have a Quick Queue on the walls let's let's see if I'm just full of it though because he acted like I saw a spirit and a jungler he was in mid lane by 2:15 done so this is it still good but he's about four five seconds behind awesome 526 seconds slow and he has a challenger levels at Academy jungler yeah we'll see it it looks like it's going to be doing a full clear unless you really want to try and go into River early so three or four is really fast I think like the house miscue I think like the fastest theoretical jungle Carthage clear is 3 minutes exactly or 259 optimal Optimus light is on Redbox Redbox has the highest Mr of any meaningful jungle Camp you're going to kill frogs have met Mr Probz do you spell damage is super high on those already and then you're finding things like what was the Raptors you're already a UE in the big one so much what you're eating your cues that like it's already at 300 house by the time you're back at the school 3:12 full clear by carthus if you noticed it's like literally a fulcrum Camp ahead of what this is wanting to do and that means you can beat level 4 in River where is his wanting to level three I guess whether a recent Academy Carthage game last week as well and this is the start and then the jugular Gamespot gank top and by the time you recalled had caught up in farm and like the camps for a second because you often get very very low as you finish my sack and they will kill you was able to safely kill the boss battle took that one took the recall gets the CD are a few items and is going to be at prom about the time to respond so I'm so far from the jungle. How's the flash really like not one but that is Flash. That's the cost right now he's up a camp for the flash but it's going to get a lot more than that cuz now the Krug the Krampus responding to the carthus and he's going to be able to cycle level 6 really quickly so then if ask him if he was like still finishing his Top Lane gang can like which one he had like caught up in Pharma now so he's two camps ahead going over the chicken and is going to be no problem and then you start getting free time so much faster is near Louisville to clear if I just take a minute total and is a 2-minute respond now on your second do you have a full minute to go do what you want to do check for top Scuttle that one's already gone chickens are up there but you know something is worth it yeah I'm thinking that maybe the power firm jungler is making a comeback yeah that's kind of my games Theory and I was the biggest discrepancy between regions that I could find actually is so like lck junglers vs if 15 is about 10 higher than everywhere else in the world so like the bunch of mechanics like they're it's not a can of waiting for its binds him right like they are actually he's about 10% less because they're getting less and they're using that time forming you can get into this whole like what is actually optimal but like if Farm jumping is actually really good then that would be good for Korea shatter hurting on it is diving into any given the game I guess I should be like is what I say a couple times a year is the game beyond the game right like you did say things that Carlos is mad at people are playing carcass and that's accurate but I think there's more interesting version of better game is for the Korean metagame is hard farming jungle so when you see a green juggler if they're going to have more Siesta mean when the Middle Ages are picking champion and playing Lanes out and talk plans to take a chance like things out there with the expectation that they're not getting ganked as much sooner that you know they're not good with and sew a direct One V one is more important in the Korean medic this could have been if they had more bottling pressure in early Dragon take by for August. 6 at 6:30 which is pretty darn fast that's the one thing that's weird with his composition like I love everything except the Casio the Casio is really good for Dave's in their game against liquid I think Environ is set to but now do I also like one thing I like Taco Cartridge for is literally that can let you have AZ everywhere else and the teams don't have to do them are now you're letting to be a lot more efficient with their purchases and turns Red Sox is for sure going to look for the early text drink to her a towel or something and actually survives the top way in about 240 nicely what is dammit Pravana sure that play for the good times that he ends up getting killed himself that's the way that I see that plate like it looks like he smashed him up until this point absolutely destroy him Lance everything q1w Q3 which is often the most seats right there I thought he was dead but he can do after flash turn back and that's when James gets 16 with the ultimate that is everyone's face in that play am I doing yep did it took a dark Harvest I don't think no rips who is it for I mean it could have been like a late on Revenge but know that I was like way later than that
