it looks good against you two thoughts are with wolf and already we're seeing a high meeting a band something you just have to take away from these European Squad because every single one of the lights are we going to see a man from The Fanatic side then because StarTalk looks very good on this Champion it's super strong right now and he can do and to overall a trip travel do twins run kid in Jungle both those wins playing with them there is that Kindred and they are not allowed in this game values most heavily asked me to drop surely will it last available earlier in the day they did find a way into the HR because we have had so much talk about a charts right and people still haven't had a lot of time to play Sons of counters into the matchup howeverthat emerged before the champion to hit balls was Fiora getting inside is there still have a good time playing the photos again to be sure it was wonders atrox to a different game but either way different stuff out here when he brought the Renekton it was in a s final game he's not respect the game stat off so soon that will be put into the boat landed and you say the capital before you go to Matrix can be flexed as wellNicholas hasn't answered very unique and the reason why I like it so much play a farm-style jungler and you can get to a level six month without getting in the way also if you come through with the charm on to atrox they can you Converse them down even after his old is used if you verse about quick enough the blood why doesn't fill up very much and you can just take him down again so a lot of Spike damage could be important in that matchup I am pretty surprised though that new Xbox One for the dilution as well and is the Swain you do come through here is it seems like they are kind of getting what if that's what they want here for you only get three bands and I think the Heimer knocked on his way bands are all good and if they don't want play suena dump the puck Falls plane is another strategy that Xbox One to playafter the economizer band what I'm surprised by though is be really applicable you start to see the support and dropped off the table right frontal course high-priority very good at the band table if I'm surprised it's tight with no Fanfare way because it's pretty quiet there so many options for his mind to pick his favorite Champion tearing it up with a Swain as well it's just it's an obvious choice of Fanatics away from the right now 6 weeks ago today lock in and they're going to find the rest of their composition again as you talked about we seen a truck going on if it lands plane as well there was a flexible line up a hard bit later he was the final pick up towards half but of course that's why they want to do is loosen + x on the bottom line it could be a loser but it's more likelywho made with a heart support pick the very very end they have a grave and I have an oreion and now it's The Rock has Adrian Fontenot back to the shed in a very similar lineup for the Clayton early today scan and Evelyn is a very powerful, but you can use the plank around and get that engagement times first somebody from 100% to 0 you can chain the TC there and then it will be very lethal I've been looking at control of course that's what you're seeing what these Pappadeaux's Whipple be flying a trois almost in the top like a fairly standard come to Spreckels soccer players playing there on paper rollwhat is pretty good their ability to slip for she's pretty good overall it feels pretty fast across the board for a little bit more focus on the early game play Lena specimens head up with a Lucian kind of want to get that smell like the Lucian and for all about those early game a little bit more emphasis style for Xbox with his very early game Pokemon give you a pretty good out though as far as creeping in through the mid and late game if Altec does have a good game on the Lucian the extra space for him to get around the sides and out play more of the still shot on Fanatics I'd be there way intended out a bit later if we are going to tell Sean to summoner's Rift Europe one game away from claiming the rift Rivals title echo-fox must win if they want toNorth Gregory's Pizza they're running patrols at 3 so alive and Air Force 1 the first inaugural one about 12 months ago you're at my cat the Revenge here today and we'll figure it out in the next hour or so kind of salmon is Red from the players spread out we could be purple heading for the topping as we expect also want to put out he was running grasp of the undying on a truck to see a lot of comment normally on that champion grass though a bit better at fighting against me listen to Lungi let's go over some of the basics Ray Charles cuz even though we've seen him in a bunch of games would be high priority here at Rift rival it's still seem like you need some of the pro players don't have against the champion regardless of your other guy playing it you know if he when he thought that the infernal changed that is the W the one that's going to put that down on the ground it is a very distorted Zone and is a very short distance to both sides that you can try and run to get out of it so you don't get Delta damaged again you don't get sucked back into it and a lot of people have kind of fallen into the Trap of this Amelie running away from aJackson out the long way which is not going to be able to find you an escape pretty early on Xbox player to counter this what you almost always want to do is throw your chain out and immediately go for the long queue cuz if you land a long queue your mini knock up is going to be long enough of a interrupts to keep them in the zone unless they already know stuff out of it and talk about when you look at a truck if you have to stay in that he get past is what I do believe it to get something to eat and just the amount of feeling that you get is based on the amount of physical damage to the lining of your abilities and you can buy now it's only like a debt he just has so much that it becomes almost impossible to take him down to the sweet spots on the accused are the things that you're also going to keep track of and what do near on the reductions going to try and dogs bottomlands guys exchange their from Echo Foxcan you see if course FAMU LCS for any office in Chatsworth supporting North America or Europe and North America respectfully and that one and right now it's lame party in the bottom side play fight again if they're trying to close as well look at the jungle is right now you can see where else to hang around the top side there is a ward in the river that will spot him out there was the potential him going for a meal of top has whippo a suit is dominant over me and already burns the flash that immediately is going to signal both junglers that they're going to have to worry about the top play match of YouTube users there's always kill potential here for the atrox as we said if you're able to get just the one knock up you can keep them in The Inferno stains out and chase him down so he's going to have to play a lot more carefully in this guy really at this part of it I think a farm basically yeah you know a lot of these games so we'll see if you keep that in mind and is able to either out play in the top side if it's a 1 b 2or not they have jar. Cover in a bit more right now. It is covering attic me to get this wave shoved in the rest of the way when he has a bunch of raging to text you and knock them down and try to look for a drink at Ward as well to see what might be slightly in farm but can help ours has taken its first exactly what this to your stack so we talked a little bit about the Evelyn in Grafton received very often to think about it likefirst blood in for fanatic another Trade Center. Acosta run away and if he wants to bottom with his hook comes in Hillside got to run out and that is a great counter take right there for fanatic on Fox committed so hard trying to kill a beautiful sites that is able to dodge the charm which allows him to flashed out of that situation and he doesn't end up losing his life and brox that comes in at the last moment to turn around before that actually shoot that capsized septic you out of. I guess you didn't wait and use the E2 Charmed the cute as a bunch of extra damage of the first hit a bunch more afterwards so first flight as we know she brought to look at the bottling fight not going to do much with that wart in his wife a simple case of getting out laid right there and we're going to take another look at it song starts early they want to pull Channel 8 that's why he goes in order polymorph but again you're not going to have the damage if you don't hit the skills. Part of the cube yeahat and credits at Phoenix as well because the reason why they were able to make this means that they should have had enough damage between them to find that through the killing stop this Noble off to eat but because it fell through. He's not going to be put behind she doesn't have his plan he's going to have to wait for that level 6 mod balls he can make plays happen in the mid lane with rocks and they can look to for the shutdown screengo back on the infernal chain and also whenever you hit your sweet spot on your cues or you cast this spell you lower the cool down on your deathbringer stance is able to finish it off there with elastic Powers auto and follow up on burning solo The Flash of uni and then also getting the solo kill just seems like fanatic with control this early game do you want to prove himself once again we have a game soon as left on Lulu easy target good job there from broxah again visiting the mid lane and making sure that folks solo Lane that leads for fanaticswinning area take a fox actually crazy to say this considering how much of their past season is gone but their bottom Lane is there hope right now I'll take an Adrian the control their first level six year for the Shen is going to maybe be an option for turning around the rest of the map so what was the ultimate on the Adrian the tank a member of the two and then when you have an ID card. Babak the forest Gastonia swept away but this. If it's still happeningRune prison and yeah it's going to be a nice jump Tollway cap stays alive I Believe by Sophie from Puerto kind of messed up the initial dive me a lot of time to kind of turn this in the favor Fox initially while he does go down hotels Tupac was looking to clean up to after that but Cat made the first Rome it so they go for a second tower dive this time around though since the charm Lancer Leon caps dripo decided he's going to take the dog out after that one and in this case you get an assistant feel so you get an extra 50% worth of the gold on it and plus you deny those Minions that were at the turret so even though youoh you're going to die going in that's still a gold Advantage for your team trading 141 in that scenario into actual game wins here you go 800 gold is not insurmountable by any means it's just happen to go to voice so far during birth arrive home again the bottling going to be the area to Adrian down there almost Eagle Farm across these two farming Champions I chunk down those aren't words to take backalright eyes again as we said mentioned we mentioned earlier the level 6 on Chene does open up a possibility of the Evelyn Shen combo dark trying to turn around the top side but as of most of this game that has been
