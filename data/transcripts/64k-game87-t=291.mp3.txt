sexy week or teams and and yet a lot of different elements need to get short up here the draft part of that look like that and kind of well you were ahead but you had the best early game team ever in your against the best liking team ever worn a fellios Oriana like that is flaking powerhouses that they actually had and it getting some point in the game where you supposed to be dominating you taking over and hitting these you know kind of Unstoppable points and how to play with the team fights what your ring conditions are and that's piece to a lot of inexperienced right yes they do have some players that have been around for a really long time I'm not sure exactly who is Shah calling in and what is going on there with The Mortals but they are are struggling pretty heavily they were predicted to shovel pretty heavily I think it's fair to say coming into the split after the roster changes were revealed but it's like yes they playtop three teams but they finish what second third and regular season like they were right up near the top so they are supposed to be supposed to be competing consent in at least having close game so the schedule gets easier for them the expectations are just going to get higher you know you should be able to beat out Immortals based on and what people were thinking we were going to get it from this hundred piece quad okay well on the game is still very nice to hear also a very well see pot looks like the first time this is Levi picked up on the immortal side on a map to go to so as it's probably going to be down there for Altec and you can probably do pretty well down there a potluck actually isI'm surprised with the orange bandanas generally if you're going to be picking trundle you want to see an orange you know you're pretty happy about that has to do with dildos that the way is often the team that is picking or in that actually began to tremble instead of the opposite we are getting here of that being said no four of the six games with these two top layers can blind have been on duty and maybe there are feeling like a Sunday is more flexible than so as do I set you on to the top, take that away from him so I will see if they're able to really kind of exploit that's not playing at all with some of the danceall right well I kind of like what happened to drop so if you look at the kind of the the story told by Katy Perry's real talk to me as real band 41 Eclipse to go ahead and play that we don't care because is what we're setting up or sitting up trundle never to play xayah rakan way to pick the champion of soap from 10.25 pretty fun pretty strong overall and does okay we were happy to take it let's go for this one we got our front front line between got great lake in damp and so far I super love let you meditate while I will say the Champions are free happy to play them in Nicholas that usually would not love to play into Leona Leanna has always been kind of considered one of the really good dancers and desire gone unique and very often walk down this work on when he jumps forward sometimes helps a burst them out you can follow him back onback on the shielding on to the diet though there are some good options there and I do think that I'll take gate if they can execute well if you have the potential to look for things like all ins and try to lock down and kill office for consew thus far though Immortal throwing more bands towards the Top Lane you know they are expecting with the R&B band out that some dude want to go for some of these Lane bullies we have not been seen my true calling at all in the ALCS popped up on the Family's couple times but it is a strong Diwali style top laner that can really carry games volibear is also so they are removing those there are still things such as the atrox available but they are going to take that away and now I'm excited in will someday be willing to pick something a little bit more aggressive Willie go to a floor jacks or something a little bit more interesting unit Fiora to try to slam this one V one or is he just going to kind of get a little bit more standardI will say is a pretty highly prized top laner globally is one of the more common ones out there but certainly is an aggressive fighter this is a matchup I'm expecting some day to win based on the players from the Champions. I will come into something else around this game or y'all going to locked in for a ride so some very stocked in our team fighting out of xayah rakan orianna and the trundle X Factor out of Sunday's Brixton and now he is a year so a lot of power in that midlane definitely we did see the reactant it'll work out well the one time it got brought out for somebody in Spring had a pretty nice game on it and has been fairly successful on it overall as you say I do think that the Oriana on a combo is very powerful is very standard can you have the trundles to try to shred through some of the front line here and I do think of the late game is going to be very very nice four hundred Thieves for the same time there is a pretty powerful they came here with youon the side of a mortal's to have pretty good engagement play making with the Leona as well as this lease in so they're going to have their opportunities to but I do think a hundred thieves both have any of the better late game and easier to ask you cam position so it is going to require I think something a little bit special hear from Immortals if they are going to able to pull this one off throughout this year have special things know the roster is a lot different from when that was happening before but you can still hold out hope I I still have that that box that that should have back pockets idea that so ask him pull out some Miracles that he stole a very good player overall not showing a whole lot this blip but I know he's got it in him so that is where a lot of my eyes are I'm kind of curious what the top Les match's going to look like over off and what we can get later on from The Immortal composition filigree if you do the heimlich on a few favored execution deals how did these favor then I still like they're dropped quite a bit so we are on a rep for our last game of the weekmorning if you're late enough in the time zones and let's do it again ourselves here it is it is always a bit concerning do when you're looking at a game and you're saying alright your win condition Immortals the guy we're looking to is so as to beat someday who had the counter pick and also just look at how they perform the last couple years right you know someday I was in the running for the best top laner of the league in Spring Isle Liquors did Edge him out in the voting but there's going to be some really really high expectations for someday again coming to the summer that he did really struggle in the spring split playoffs to be fair that was a pretty big light down for a lot of hundred these fans as you know people are kind of saying yeah this is going to be someday proving everyone wrong on the voting and he's going to slam liquor and then he kind of got blasted and is now looking for some Redemption coming to the summer split in and try to perform again at the high-level it because he saw himself as best top laners Leagueacrylic can be done there are 15 games to play in the regular season this is one of them see if the road Redemption Starts Now is b03 start obviously not what either he wants but he leaves for potluck over there going to be a solo job for me dies down here they're both going to get the red bumps that particular time from a really good at 11 that the heart beating analysis even in love with us today and one team can win one keeps going to lose at three games have been played 15 games left you know why I thought it you know I was really good at most basic math precalculus course Relic Shield the most common for the vast majority Pro Sports because it's way more reliable for gold and some are very nice he's playing, so it is kind of more looking tothose Early Trades you can also see that you know by the cool down on his crafting potion there when he popped it how you going to be playing time warp Onyx so a very likely you know time warp Onyx porch, and all these things are often about winning those Early Trades it's much more focused towards that and I would expect you to be winning those trades in the early Lane when you're playing against someone who is FaZe Russian very likely appoint Gathering storm in front of them worse feeling rude that's really pushing the Box light right here it's going to be at the end of the third wave of captivating that's always cool because it's not always do a boyar often Under Pressure Brewing opposing Lane and plains are fighting somebody Jukes away from the knock back and took his tractor going it's going to be a big heavy trade there in the middle and yet again if we're going to get the trading heavier it is available for real Moto E4 make it look the TV back and you are always in a little bit of a dangerous situation right after you teleport because if you get gang post he becomes very very punishing, but Wyoming out back in Lane here you don't want to spend too much is a minor thing but this is something that actually sometimes people mistake and make us a mistake a lot if you face first as though leaner and spend your TP to get back it is safe to assume generally your opponent is going keep you back soon and sometimes you'll see if he will be back in a lane and immediately spend all their spells on their opponent in like I pushed you out but it is essentially wasted right after you and teleport back to and then you don't have those resources for when I come so I click it right on the right now he's down at what twenty 30% Nana and I was returning at a full moon so he's going to reset one more time in this case is that makes a kind of okay because you were just looking to continually reset but just something I see I see a lot of players sometimes misstep on for sure if you trade that okay can you back like an outage on my Lane so I can shove safely in this case of dementia and yes it did work out but I've seen that one of these back to our guys goes 50 health and I got to get back to Laney's when I get the money right now thanks bud and yeah I've seen the really extremely bad version of that overran in probably two for right now for now bottom Lane yeah you're seeing a pretty big for me to Cody's on Sunday if she does Winnie trade but I know he is winning the trade that he is struggling to have you know that perfect Farm while doing so and that's something we know that I've seen what I've gone back and kind of watched him for views of his in the past but they are looking for this bottling tank hear potluck moving down flat roof going to find the dueling will stay alive it is 37 Asbury Avenue mortal side to down for under these Cody sun will be an easy target because they claimed they were too early to be thinking that hay under these Bali in June it back off here to this is our only opportunity to try to go for it now they did get some pressure there which is why is here remember cast The Flash thing for the leash him if he's not going to say they don't have to buy us the immortal do I had already taken the recall First wall texture time for round the first to move go get it after all is bright going to be no problem is he doesn't really work out but the bottom line pressure and they use that to take the dragon so still pretty happy with that play overall if you are Immortal but a hundred thieves here back in time to farm this stuff and they can either fries or pushed for they do desire so I was getting pretty low up here on this top side doesn't pull back in though yeah yeah baby yeah I saw him move a little bit Drake thankfully it's because the other bottle in Her Dream by either you can put them out or you know they took a recall timing if you go straight it means you missed your rehoming which means that the guy and you're in League with nothing and you just believe the lane until you take a battery call yourself what Altec to get minutes to do was get their own recall then once they're back in Lane with a band Pepper or longsword in Boots stuck in the gang come forth to recall before he spent your money it's fine we can then stay afterward the film The Wave take the Drake it's fine to go back it again at the Publix first then they did all those things that allowed them to have a fairly efficient kind of path around the bottom Lane and I think that's really intelligent when you consider the fact that Clifton looking for a BF recall any way right so just kind of AFK farming set 1353 goldmark and then basing alongside desire did not beneficial for the Kalisto no getting back on that 900 gold for the answer's going to be feeling pretty good some day 20 of them these trees pretty healthy up here on the top side but I was out videos that could be pretty hard to actually you'll follow through in it dive that eat rocks and see if they have 10 right now is the waves will not quite receptive some days man cumming Georgia past week and want to keep them out of the media is going for this Harold up in the fit and because I have no preference to be in danger but it's okay they can make a great you're going to go for a form and I but instead why are they even arrive because I actually stayed around I think if you just wait for you to use your pen for a great shows up
