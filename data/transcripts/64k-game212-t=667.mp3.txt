for that always made finals every single time was the first team to ever stop them from getting through a finals appearance and now to get them here looking for some revenge against them and looking to move on by like the jugular Support Services on Sage support Kobe and his tail and we have ourselves into this one of course if you want since we saw them a year ago in playoffs and open the they can give you two look very good here. I'm dropping lots of aggressive takes away from Tony specifically as you heard the hype video game in the quarterfinals and forget who he was he I think he is back to being an aggressive top and he's very dominant and the Band 3 Champs so why is SAU bi ban that is banned all this is what's a graphical are too much did band all free Champions that is so natural and human has been banned out by them and and a lot ofInFocus Dairy when you think of this could bring that out Rumble as well has been his go to fix though I'm trying to Target the music. Very clear draft strategies coming into the game on the side of clutch of course they're targeting 50th and bottom lane and then has made some critical errors in some very big game for the team so they're trying to whittle down on that apple and make him as uncomfortable as they possibly can here we go there quick lock is already and it is going to be the Gangplank for clutch in answer to a collie. Let's go to zaira cattaneo as you are expecting your call to get paired with it a Vulcan if we talked about actually brought out Leona as an answer to this I do believe last week though I certainly has the ability to go that route would be pretty excited to see him bring that out here in playoffs with the question is now then maybe getting pushed down in the easy pool so they will be locking in the difference that was going to work rate with the Starsbut they already have one of the calling cards for Cody son is safe Farm Good vs numbers in the late game Insurance I've liked that role for him the pills that one quite well like the good early draft you for Clutch Gaming right ponies on big damage lyrics on a very strong bank and put it on his calling card they do have a lot of possibility for scaling up for big damage output later in the game will see if TSM tried to get an early game jungler for speaker because I think jungler interaction is going to do a lot to determine the way that this entire series will unfold I was lyrics showing his Garner already it does mean are locked into that tank Frontline to pick your is a good take away from Cody SEMO because well you have something you do a lot of very scaling Markman Desai has been in the most played by far in a 6 pick the next most pick was only three plays though certainly strong to Elaine for TSM get them some powerdown there but also a denial of who the most popular picks for Clutch Gaming I'm so bored right there to the final picks and bans come through one jungle ben-levi here at speak to me in the driveway on the back to remove tear so can easily go to a comfortable take for hand and still be a thank you for my for the squad I feel like he is being left out very conspicuously you know it almost feels as though they're there must be some sort of a plan or that they don't feel that it's because going to be comfortable to Maxim the early game perhaps coming out of out of the ER if if they're leaving it open but you know it's been a consistent pick early on in the draft that is surprising if you get all the way down here into the second take phazyme pick unbanned a little bit and a lot of games do you have ways of getting out of touch old you think about Gangplank is there a specific please so that might be part of it isjust wanted to be sticking out of the old eat so I can see that thing the logic of what they're going for a nautilus locked in here for Vulcan and his first player ever in the LCS and gets of course a nice engagement bottom left-hand corner from lir for that and there's a Four Sisters wine guy I think no surprises the tank he remembers getting locked in here at the end both teams looking at those five on five fights at work the mid-section of the game guaranteed engaged or whenever you have skarner it's really important to have some other form also for engaged now they've got not fight they've got their own guaranteed to take over but there is a potential is actually swap things around and even put you to karmasoft potentially I liked it will be, did the tether you interaction working very well against akali these days after revealing you in the drought so thewill be last pic Carmike you're rounding of the composition certainly bilteer it feels like around Cody done to support and speed up him you have to beat up with the monster shields for the Garner as well as that's it we're all set for your front line to engage a my eyes for the early game are definitely going to go towards the top laying here Broken Blade for TSM on the kled Gangplank early and stack up the gelottis passes so fast with a vicious strikes you basically instantly get off that done and even though Gangplank can eat the oranges to get out of one's these days there's multiple Duo yeah the bear trap on the Rope you know if you hit that second part you will actively putting the healing peba on there so you're not going to get as much healing out of the oranges and you have to remember that question sound is it hurt a crow drop so that can be extremely powerful when you are looking for dive know how you leave does in Italy sorts of Champions you have to think that clutch knows they're going to be going after Gangplank though and in trying to be up there to protectvery scary heading into the first game of a best-of-five you messed up an early Tower dive that can be very detrimental to the mentality of the team head again next year are the games going to be in Port best top for a year is over North America in Fortville in the regular season have not stopped them before it's here we go game 1 of the finalssummer has been a quite the journey for both of these teams as you can see on stage 4 clutch now wearing new colors as well with the black and yellow and 40 at them a lot more struggles and I thought ya mean TSM coming off of your MSI performance you know they were one game away from taking down TL got reverse wet but it seems like things were going to be even better coming into summer no wrapping up building a pond with the new learned and kind of improved pain in sprained but it has not yet been the case but we do have to remember that she hasn't has had Seasons like this before with you're not performing at the best during the regular season they eat at the right time during playoffs in Sunrise make final thing me the postseason happened it up hit a coaching staff by with Peter from TSMthanks guys I am here with Coach Peter wanted to pick your brain we saw speak of being announced as your starter for playoffs and also the addition of treats and tactical your subs want to find out what was the decision making behind that especially entering quarter-finals of playoffs when it seems like a huge risk it's a hard decision is that saying go to three Jonas we have is been great but just based on his groomers is out and the stage performance we sinks become might have a better soon as you wish. That's why we choose him decided after week 9 I want to ask you what do you think about Clutch Gaming is an opponent because this is a team that with Hootie and with Tony son is a mate you feel like they can really pull anything out against youI mean I've been with the mountain and who needs a definite response team doing the level with spirits and broken but yet I appreciate the confidence and four people don't know. Thing is actually been in the ALCS in Ennis the academy league for a very long time speaker on stage we interviewed him after his first week of game skate so much credit over to Peter specifically for teaching him a lot and getting him ready for these LCS A's game and they're paying that confidence back with only we have to really touch on is this is Elaine spot Cooney and Demonte have actually swap Lanes to avoid that games like in the cloud matchup and what are the things you can do is actually utilize the karma in the early game to try to deal with this but then what's GP is a little bit stronger once you have enough Wave 3 has some items are bubbles you can match up against but just fine it is much more of that early game counter and you can stroke of ladybug press the attack which is more for the lane and he barely gave birth to try to Simply get those solo kills got super valuable as well because, with the AP thread makes you think twice about your itemization for Lane as well so Demonte and who needs working well together as they've played weather is actually very important and to be flexible as we've seen in multiple International competition is mandatory here we go there with the invade on bottom side do the pushing of the TSM Duo Tapas is actually area which is more about the Tea fights as well as the folk in laying in and getting Clyde dismounted really is your goal at once client is this mounted you know he's not able to actually do getting raised to get a quick remount becomes extremely dangerous to stay in Lane only got to fight of the top song right now is now there's plenty of damage and power W get some health back up there on the market for that he goes his car runs away and that is really good timing honestly love you off and you go in for that aggressive trachea to mate just now through their he's going to spend the rest of the damn to do it and you choose that is how you want to play out on the other side I also like how jamonte does not panic a lot of people when you see quite especially activating the vicious strikes you got a little bit scared with the first image that can come out but karma can rely on the Hue offer the tether as well as the shield coming back up with the cool dancer of the mate does not panic does not waste a Summoner spell do that all in and now though it might open it up to some jungler interaction Theory as both junglers post level four do you have their flashes available Predator early purchase hear from Lira on this Garner you can see as a lot more threat early game over the wall but you all the damage was done, he backs away does got out of there and who is going to be very strong as Landing items are giving you that early game Power and I'll be able to see where broken plate does electives go if it is just going to be towards Tiamat I think that is probably the bills we will see you know get some of these range matchups what's the best way to stack to avoid the visits be able to quickly clear out the wave with you mad and your cues and then be able to look for dental wrongs or grouping up with zika minions could include her in the bottle and can take a look at how all the different lanes are going so far has been TSM took the early pic on Zyra, very strong do and they're indeed up quite a bit of about 6 right here by the other ladies it's been very much Clutch Gaming you talk to you than first pick the akali first game Pearson or Broken Blade have been this game and didn't answer the games like to be a counterfeit can you see the clients, attempting to be a kind of picking a master Lanes the way they wanted so much winning in both dolos up as a team several hundred gold he has used the first teleport as well to get back to Lane on Jahnke like it's trying to keep up his fresh Precure now to level six key is the target of the first possible gang no damage has been his forced to flash a way that I can was there could have been enough follow through steps have someone to spell down hoody have to be defensive down this Lane. Very respectful honestly flashing that you know did have his ear was behind them but you didn't want to risk getting actually stand up by the satellite yeah you have to be so so careful can't keep your oranges and get out of the knock up and then sits when it will have to stuns ready with a passive locked up looks like we're not going to have a fight quite yet over the river and lie they want to damage outfit go to use them running away gif and it got now broke into clutch on this speaker that quit teleport so from TSM really paying off Sven even in a few things we did see broken play very fast on the TV to join in and a CSM on that collapse allows them to fight back yeah you can see it's the first game of the best-of-five first game of all of playoffs in summer here in the LCS everybody's waiting for the first place to break out after Ward up on the top side by the movement there a little bit suspicious that's why everybody's ready for the executor fee really couldn't kill Tony there for the end up getting them later and now another fight down on this bottom sides moving here pretty low lyrics has been spotted this week it is in the area this is not a they're going to want you can see there already is 6 but he does have sex as well but have the HP Advantage so so they should be safe just push this out I think because mostly just staying around in case of any potential aggression but now freezing this wave. She trying to bake let's to go in Landon cube of a knock up there but I want to be a saint with all the Minions pausing with aloe health bars and speak of waiting around for the play that's in coordination with the new Jungle are assembled want to see onstage yeah that was a really smart move you just that small fries know you know let them know the clutch can't actually reset there they'll mess up their way from Cleveland to be losing a lot of far but if you don't have to fully commit to this phone can you do instead of just trying to push it out does Park commit to it with the hook yeah he takes that bake Hook Line & Sinker all right in on Tuesday that's when he said they have a shield and knock up they know that they've been had here walking to be leaf
