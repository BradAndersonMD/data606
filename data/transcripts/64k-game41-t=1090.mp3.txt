can anyone figure something out here against Team Liquid flyquest is obviously had a lot of time to try to strategize against them but Team Liquid has been on such a tear of late in a winning I believe $16 last 17 games they are crushing it I've been extremely consistent but and we have heard in some of the interviews flyquest feeling confident against him liquid and they did show us some pretty creative Champion to lakhs in playoffs so far and I'm I'm pretty interesting to see if they can find some sort of way to going to use that to their benefit because I do think if there isn't it for flyquest he comes in the draft we seen on 10 to 15 a lot more creativity picks from all around the world are our kind of being injected into the nav meta and I think likewise maybe we can take advantage of that but if we can of course we know that he liquid have the small of champion. Joan of the LCS so far that's going to let them to a first place regular season ends there best record ever spell for undefeated in the playoffs could well poised to bethe best team liquid we have ever seen in this is a team that won four straight sweats just two years ago so the question is how well can they do with Rookie of the Year tactical and how much can there new head coach in jet leave the way for the squad they can see a lot of Carrie Focus truckers are off the table in the Evelyn is exceptional we know how it is around there as well as a top sandals like that one is left up impact then a left up which is a pretty big deal here as well and you're very kind of crop in Caitlin Ash in the botlink there is well then maybe the first picture I mean if you're willing to do a trade if your happy playing both sides of the matchup it doesn't really matter if you can go to wear something like this in and try to force solo to play something that could punish the chat but honestly that maybe not as easy for us to do because they generally leave Solo in a more kind of plane tweet side of the map anymore with stanza matchups though you generally the match of the actually punish at are things that require some attention some protection from your jugular they do grab that set they have been very very keen on it overboth top and jungle and using it as a flex between do we have not the power of evil play I don't expect that we will but you know this is probably more of a jungle pick and you know I would love to see solo go towards something like you know the GP perhaps or even going to be a p options such as you know Casio and Vladimir that can do pretty well into the gym so we got a really really big put a top tier Champions right now because a lot of Savannah cat breed of it targeted at various layers indeed acronym is in we are still on pain from nurse the outlet Nerf the Caitlin there's none of those are in on this patch I still think acronym is a top top tier Champions and set or the number one in two chance across all of pro play in this patch I think spend and pepper the objective Lee actual best jungler and toppling ass personal opinion and Ash Road alongside I mean I love both of drastic very strong I'd still like deals Champions morethis is a new pic for cl so we'll see how rocks is going to be able to Pilot it it's a lot about not just those pics in isolated about the combo shrimp is a very very powerful backline diving combos I'm going to be in to see if TL want to drop more dive alongside them you off into the back line with the heck room to Shen Stand United on top of you you get right on top of the 80 care if you're the one with the ultimate into a taunt that could be a very very tough combo to deal with for wild turtle on this Caitlin and that is kind of what they're looking to do I will say though and generally speaking hecarim need to stay ahead of the pace of the game hacker I'm playing from behind it's generally pretty difficult to succeed so we may see broxah try to really power Farm because hecarim does have a great clear I like the Morgana been here though there is not parody in the picnic bands as know we have potentially jungles match and popping 40 L support Pick 4 flyquest and they could ban up with Tom can't hear as well if they wanted to knock some more of those safetyI'll pix to be paired alongside that Ash but how you could also be worried about something like a bar if you want to deny play making but will be the time can I look at the TLC Squad is that they are very physical heavy shed at the physical damage stop When I Was Your Man ask for the same for their respective roles but they were just living use number 2 in damage here in playoffs so far so I'll just you can easily bring into magic damage bit later in case you're worried about flyquest front lines. And armor and most likely stand for in sexy pretty good right there we'll see what they're toppling traffic is going to be because at this point that's like Wednesday to toppling bands against them they can counter pink top and they can wait in kenefick bit here as well if the foreign to them they dropped off the bands to make sure the Caitlin thrash can be an unanswered bottom light could look very good and Lena cases like Mystikal to drive to write my guess is they just go on and you know what I do think that you could go towards Vladimir or something like that but you know I'm not sure that they're willing to play that sort of a styleit's more of a you know step away from the kind of pics if they have been comfortable in doing more to Kaiser in GP are the two strong matchups in the shed that like with his already shown so that's why those are getting bad out but it is going to be the azir line so obviously has some sort of conditional counterpick they want to see what else Team Liquid has in store before they do go for it and that is to be pretty interesting but I but I will say I'll be up at this morning for black West if it's just like elastic Renekton Oren and you showed your bed lamp or nothing but it looks to me a lot of this like it is why I was really trying to push down in the jungle is Neil yeah I mean could easily happen there as well to take him still moves they want to wait for that one little bit longer on top of the supposed to be spicy your pic but you know that band out all the big talk like an event which has a band out roxiticus Champions they took away and band way Jensen stop to hear as well as going to put him onto his second a colleague of the yearplay Austin the most important that so far this year and it's going to be boss to call in which we have some very very well across the World Champ really is in we did see a pretty impressive game from Jensen in his akali game he was 9 0 and ate it was against The Mortals I will say in that game despite chance of having a credible individual performance Team Liquid did look less comfortable though because it was such a a different style right they didn't have that a z or orianna going to play front-to-back is a different style of game that you have to play out it's not just the change from Jensen Beach Jensen was fantastic with the flaxen I can find a good angle to get to work that back like and it isn't that could be that last pick 4 in here so I will say I'm pretty disappointed with the pick order from flyquest I do think that there's no reason you can't just blind that and then allow power be able to get some more preferential matchup know perhaps you would have preferred the Oriana or something along those lines into the akali and what does generally deal with the trout a lot better soyeah that is something to consider but good playmaking Encore JJ you know he's going to be over on that blitzcrank Blitzkrieg thrash is an interesting matchup you can actually try to time your hook it with Retros for a hook you can hook in the thrashed actually Target him so a lot of playmaking ability hear a lot of engage and I40 L they are moving outside their normal Comfort Zone in this first game against like West all right well Champs are locked in Jensen the LCS leader and most games played on a collie we're going in for game one let's get it startedwelcome to summoner's Rift for game 1 of the supper bracket final best-of-five the winner of this VO5 the first one to knock down three next I will be in the LCS summer finals they guarantee they will not be in the play in stage at world twenty20 that they will not have to face DSM for the right to get back to the final itself loser of course is going to face TSM and we'll see what happens if that one is they Battle of secure second or third and we're out of the rift here with fairly standard spread out teammates and opponents and wait to see what comes out of this game is to be phase Rush ghost tech room here so he's going to be a very quick horse that there is some debate on on should you be on your face rashyou be going in a conqueror or even Predator a Time some people who go to Ward's I think these rashes is just incredibly strong it's something that not only has as a utility in combat but people are are really starting to recognize how how strong can be even defensively to play towards Vision you know if you are the sacrum and you're going to lose out an extended one we won against the set you can still move into the river try to sweep out towards our place downtown where did your own and if you do run into Mickey's the phase rush for retreat do I have a lot of utility there a frost it is going to be starting your over on the Rafters you can do this solo start very very easily because of the alien macaron you have a really strong clear on all of these multi-target camps in getting that burned down with a Talisman and keeping yourself fairly healthy Terry farmlead year is Centaurus going to say yep we clear the war comes up says yeah you would know there is no waybecause the very minor least they can tell the start of the Jungle but that is only going to be a guess you can question mark pains right now from the team liquid sites in the Eastern jungle saying well if he's normal passing he might be read the blue of course early-game set is a single Target Camp Champion you want to do red blue green red blue and it becomes something that I really want to point out here to flyquest it has been so good with their level ones in their pregame planning this is another entrance to that because as you say you're not only is it that you would have to guess on the side of TL where he was they had award in the tribe rush in the river that would have actually covered that path and then at the time and where Brock The Cook's Nook around that word of gone down through the bottom line try brush up the word the blue Buck ignore moved out of Lane immediately to put award there so they knew exactly where Brock's it could have come from what timecould have been there at and because of that before it has full knowledge that he stole the way that I can see all of his camper still remaining and they will get a significant lead off of again really smart passing from santorin really clever early game planning and warding off yet those words did not come into play this game but they had both sides both exits and pasta broccoli could have possibly use and I just speak how intelligent they are with these These are the game jungle starts and Team Liquid don't tell Ford we will figure it out eventually and right to recall off and is down at most one camp now sees their constant hey at some point this guy run around and took my top jungle he's got his chickens back fairly soon is not going to be a death sentence for broxah will getting a recall off he's totally fine overall but is the state we are in right now for Central and got to get the camps you wanted and did the lead will extend from your rightknow what once you clear out these camps and you start having nothing to do is the jungler that is when said is going to be pulling ahead because that is going to have extra cancer meeting on his side of the map he also has while options of where he would go but Santorum still not recalling his Exodus sneaking down here on the bottom line is down there. Very well done temp from fly bites because had that built over Peacemaker actually connected I do believe it get the killing blow on corejj so very aggressive passing gear unlikely that you would expect that down there at that time and didn't spot him with hot shot they didn't really know where he was and he hadn't even recall the app so does get a little bit of a farmVantage to be able to blow some the sun goes down there you're so many pretty happy with straight overall because both of flashes are available there for wild turtle in eggnog and this is going to be play aggressively or Potter aggressively whatsoever in this to be to now because if you have sec with you know set an in thrash and exotic ways that though unfortunately that one regardless we can take a look at the various lengths as you mentioned the jungle difference will grow over time spent for and got a gank off and his own first three colonies up a camp right now with very little left of the Akron to do he'll cycle back to his chicken pretty soon in the middle and we've got equal for McQueen use liners both of them level six in the Top Lane he must be exact same boat here so very very close gave one sonas expected and we'll see if like West you were the kings of First Blood to get that happen to this game again you that little Shadow revealed and then you can actually try to Auto her by doing a minion and then having the soldier stabbed Brew in that small line in a weed to actually connect to call is over there are some ways to a taxi Hollywood he is here in this matchup even when she's in the Shroud call the also has to be worried about any potential is your ultimate the scooper out of the Trap flyquest do on this dragon look up he'll be able to finish it before tal gets here before just to be back in helps it to Beaver's butt in first reply Quest doing this a lot of checking cannot get it you flashed in and could not find rock them for one second kill in his fight and I'll Fly Awayit is to Destin Florida toll both dropping the flight but dies it with just a hair of HP there fairly
