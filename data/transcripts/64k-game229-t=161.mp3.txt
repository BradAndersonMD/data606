what is doing well. I think they're going to look good in and then there in their last game and it wasn't just who he was head FBI was very very well also we have came to do it for two games that's far they have been very aggressive in the whole time hoping for more of that sort of style yes it did not work out in their game against office because you're meet us had some incredible counter games that really just shut them down but I think this is an exciting look for the golden guardian and if they can consistently play aggressive and have success in that to be to have been golden Guardians may be a much better team than shown in the first half of the split the case they could be another split that has been into the playoffs this year as they can keep to get better over time and and I can see 5 and 5 vs 3 + 700 flights out of playoffs with only a few more to play eight games left counting this one and that we can see us 2 bands off for sites like was throwing a lot of enchanters to Fort Bend tackle the Guardians we can be, play other roles but I would be probably less than third one theredefinitely would not be too surprised I have also been playing no other message 4th like valve cause any sorts of things but certainly does have a pretty flexible champion pool in that regard and do with you even if you see him playing a lot of Roman gay types of War think one month Leona certainly has been a favorite of his though will be the stage 1-e final game here cuz he's available you need to know. Up and it's going to be a bit of a difference if you know this is certainly something that everyone was going to this is not that we know why I believe the graphic is incorrect or of an old lady back in her size and their house is going to be who he has been playing a more defensive role in the outside Lane anytime I see Tom can't have always done with wondering are we going to get no more heavy slip for style are we going to get that type of a working with the early so now you're expectingSpike Lee's donut Eric to be coming through here for a wild turtle and we need some can see other comment pairing with the donuts are even taking off the table it is possible that this is just going to be a standard bottle in her alongside the Sonos right because that is very abusive early but not a lot of willing to play that is too kind of phone Orville when she is looking forward to helping will Tomcat varicella can do a lot of damage in field healing reduction buy a playing the fairest time Kentucky had so many base that's going to walk if you want to hit them and you'll win the 212 so when we talked with old Gucci joining the Golden Gardens and giving him pointers and self who he of course was under a year since I've helped them out and he's already at 6 are locked in thereis no a media tech support agency that Eric right away band out and into your voice I feel like like like the leaving this up and say yeah go ahead dance in Fort Smith AR country down there about their Corky which were to Municipal Authority directly to be flexible if they want to get really tricky New York back in the Tariff band that does come through stylist very likely will be playback contract in the jungle we started a little bit you even at 9:12 and it's got major bus on 913 and really I think has skyrocketed to become the premier jungler don't know at least up there with Ted 1 T and is going to be very very strong a contract saying it because he does strike me like one of those wow this is going to be on top then I don't think so I think it's more likely so I am now it's doing this this is going to be Jarvan top right side jungle so really getting tricky here you know, with the pick ban and it is hard to know exactly whatyou're going to see you on the side of golden Guardians when you're not sure where things are going to go you're likely going to look for just the most stable planers things that are pretty blind pickle fries safe that's exciting as well now I want to posit the small chance of Tom kench top with support but I want to respect it I mean it's actually pretty good backed up in the Darvin Darvin support really sent for quite a while actually we had that seeks an Evac a p jarmon support is going to be fast or a style or if it is going to be more of a tank or damaged people were going Aries Jarvan Emax flag poke Digger team attack speed buff as wellFiora work from that I that is something that would make for both are very very scary in the later stages of the game I don't know how they're going to really match up in the Doobie to it feels like it's driveable have a very difficult time going for because if you engage in pumpkin just so powerful you know what I could turn that around on you if they can poke out that there is no with his E-maxx Jarvan perhaps and it ain't going to look for that service out that could work going to be getting a relatively early game anyway right you going to be the farming champion of the game so it's going to be almost certainly won't have the manifold that's too early for the East band butt and go see what this does look like of course you would be likely either so it does feel a bit rough for the black guy on the red team but it looks like in the long termLast Chance Auburn Al Lynn you'll give him these Summers and given out their room choices there I think neither side really should have a damaged actually no be able to resist retinol in 2 weeks unless they going down very heavily before that alright this should be very interesting really creative drive away thanks guys invert soda j4 bot Lane how is that going to work for you guys today so one of the things that counters of soda weigh knows he's seen his team sent to take the time country way and then try to have strong die presents DJ for prevent sad eyes compared to the pike which is what people normally try to pick so we prevent to dies with the Jarvan and then we make sure that the Sona gets the scale. While on the other side of the map were able to make plays as well and the drive-ins Affleck's when it so when were able to do that they think they're picking into German jungle but they're not that we get back on your counter pick as well and did you expect in return to the bot Lane in Dubai yeah we had an inkling especially cuz definitely know they were playing the Academy games therefore we kind of had an understanding of what FBI and who do you want to play a specially cuz they're newer bottle and they've only showing like certain amount of pics so we were prepared for that but thank you and best of luck to you and the team back to you guys variance think so and utilizing the Charmin to help prevent that I have to think that doesn't make sense to a long a line to take the exhaust and I do think to be fair it can be difficult to the flag drag NACA is actually a pretty powerful different if you mess up your dive at all and you are basically dumped their garbage disposer can help the delay but I definitely don't see this as newly of a defensive option is something along the lines of Tom kench so I will have to see how this does play out it is the East are so for which he's though he will be the farmer in then we'll see how he can be able to play this one out nearly level of far as he knows that the steering is a melee tahm kench is quite High there's so much damage of the chair lamp in early game defensively in last hit what he can you always expect Lil Wayne new Adidas going to do his very best to try to get some of that good to hear Danny going to walk backwards on a 94 gets the still sweet spots and I stopped by Hans there and with Frankie 1/4 of the lifesteal as well that jungle do you think of Jarvis but instead it is like the Rounds in Torrington to take hail of blades recti very powerful Hurley do list on this Champion so no should have your early game invented definitely in that won't be one and we'll see if you can be able to utilize. To get any service Co controller or anything along those lines but for now you can see both attended or pushing in or golden Guardians which is good to give contracts priority I have a both know where each other are as far as we was taught that shows since when walking topside clearing his fourth Camp right they are with the bloom getting hit nose contracts and down there by his own Groff and looks like you'll be trading Scuttle crab so it's kind of taken to South 1% we're heading Northwest again and just one that means he can be available if I came to last time active open contract with the math does get it but since we're not even going to actually check it out on it surprised by that you know perhaps does not feeling super confident and it's be able to make that invades and his new leader is still being plugged in but he did have the pushing top so I feel like at the me to consider actually might be going for an early blue donate at the very least thought he was coming over here to help cover but I do think this will be the first blue actually going straight over to fragen cheapest way to get talk to me really nervous in a cup out of the temple and say they were expecting the right side of his around new just in case that it did become a battle at that Blue Buffalo end of the day it is going to be normal us across the board but I get to your point I think you're right center when did have the space to probably steal that blew away. Took the tickets instead and his back on the map and you know he'll be fine for the rest of the time but it just ask what if that went a little bit differently around nice to you by honne tour length of second was well really doing nicely it's a lot of damage down and now contract where can I find that link I do believe there was a? Painting over on that War II they didn't know he's in the area since we're not just been hanging out waiting for a potential cake opportunity but now knowing this island is gear concert should be able to feel very easily push this out this will mean Viper has to expend the teleport end up getting that additional invented goes home with war farm and also can just walk this right back to lay and hold on let's see if he does so desire I want to see Piper picked out a freeze thing is as you mentioning the entire wave down again and I think could afford the TV instead made out of fries and and they don't lose an entire wave their the danger with a strategy like that because the wave was stacked so high as if you just use your TV and you take too much damage then you can start to lose control the plane simply because of a kind of Health Ephrata there so instead he will push that out who you like that bind to get another key for such as the one that attacked you track contract a little bit earlier and placing a pink they're over by that blubaugh till you're just trying to keep yourself safe to Ward's here I should keep them safe from anything besides of Central Link anklet that's going to be very hard to pull off with a knife piercing Arabic wildturtle very low who does FLOTUS me to get back to Lane he's 40 May 1st recall for the frosting itself but here is almost ready to go then you can make that a reasonable recall on to it until then though who is the just kind of protective Stone allowed to skill-up I would say accomplished thus far do you have Farm barely equipment on both sides who generally do expected the stone Elaine's to be pretty far down and they will be able to get a reasonable by off the back to base FBI is going to be like that teleport to try at the very least Force out the teleport from his own it but this wave will be pushing towards him back so they may be keeping contracts down here and trying to put my question cuz it's awkward position where they need to reset the way they need to push out and doing that would expose themselves, no matter what as the recalls come out through nose and Silas and do a little bit of magic from there is so I guess it fits that bill recently well it is to Max on this driving by the way so not the flag attack you is simply Allure cool down the Q and we're on her pain that's Pretty in Pink building a Bissell does give you a little bit ER as well and we can do actually go up to your completed side Sonja gazinski are there also so I'm having a little bit of that in the mix and hopefully we'll get Tanked app that you can actually actors that primary it should be magic damage camping or afford two of his Primary Care Easley Stone automatic damage the Corky who is almost entirely magic damage so it does become Mormon offensive in that regard as well and makes sense for Bissell mask in this team competitions pretty cool stuff and really really across the map it is fairly slow pace as far as the lanes are not playing Super aggressive will Guardians is going to make this move now and I haven't pushed in bot Lane having the pushing midlane a little bit they are the first one to make a group on this move up and it looks like if I question just happy he's afraid of giving up and we'll be dropping that over but and we have seen of the zipper bootie I think from stand for in this split to the Pixies are looking Champions and not always be as aggressive with them with you time from a lease and jarvin them down but it is pretty well played by Woody toe peeling knock up denying the rain for the cataclysm there from contract so it does keep him safe but a lot more aggressively into the past has been working stats cosplay this farming out of style are they do have very good feeling so maybe the right size is used more to match the early game but it's a good thing when you hear in her talking about the idea of getting the jungle counter pick and then just seeing it become a appear far matchup yeah FairPoint will be sent when does gout in the board and out in the map in GTA V action before too long the right now is the first for the aggression for Golden Guardian The Sims look in the bottom River and I'm going to finish taking a break with normally around for the divorce is the boss playing at work again
