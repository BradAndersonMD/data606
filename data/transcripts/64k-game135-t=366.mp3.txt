being sad let's see if u g can take down TSM or if it is Nick's for them in the standing less send it over to the catcher's how you doing I'm doing well the first game we saw Team Liquid at least move a little bit up in the standings are going to be tied for 6 at the end of this week with basically the whole week and then here we got to see if PSM can either be alone in her third or part of a huge five and five Thai people have computer to say they think the SMS temperature team in the league will see if their record Cancun reflect that and they'll be either one or two games behind second-place based on today's results Evil Geniuses name of high hopes for the four and five first round robin does not speak to it looks like Texadelphia and the first time these two teams played it was one of the closest gameKings of the split it was one ocean stole away from being away from being an open still game for Evil Geniuses actually win and based on the way grass of gone getting that first pick oranges got to feel good for kiss him I forgot what I was given this one yes Bank Freight late-game trundle you want to see it but I don't think of a pic they going to look at the Ezreal instead coming through you mean already gone so no, he's in there like threatening as a trundle we still could see you meme come in after the edge was already locked that's when the best Kitty ever quit PSN has every option. In the jungle 15K Dana 60 Minutes over all this stuff for himself early game in the LDS second obviously only to Cloud 9 but doing a lot of things well in the early game it's been since burning it that's been the problem for them yet so they can finish Run Around Back to Basics for TSM with another syndrome I feel like it just keeps getting pissed sooner by them every week it's their first pick on red side and here it is like you know what we once free games on Sandra already why not go for for this split and they lock it in really early really speak to me that is in his of 1 cup of pic I think he's very good in a day and I mean the leblancs syndrome matchup can be very explosive and he has had some very good LeBlanc as well as if you move to the block game so both these are going up against each other with their most picnic with tell me fun is very enjoyable to me as feta is out of the band fool and we'll see what else comes through DSM to figure out what what exactly do you want front of this cop there bot Lane is left I want to see a uni band here earlier on so I'm sure that's okay it looks kind of like so I think I got no worries that there is an unanswered jungle pool which is why the driver with your band practice to add on that one as well at least it ofcourse come through that are highly prized jungler in the one that bends during has paid but it's the job in argon from Israel would give them a strong little one as well as can improve team cutting which is veronese against the horn but I don't think he was going to see if so I would even though it's like pretty out of it what baby shivering the adrenal you look now I mean he at rest is also a little bit of face that you just do a bunch of crit I think I think it's almost like she never leave the meta and Eddie Vedder wear it like you have three. Enterica real lame pressure and they think they were all the as real Branagh some cases but you from ever recall. Alleyne I really don't like sedge when your major blach I don't think you need to take first does a round thing already I want some more explosive it is an interesting debate I think it's going to be two stage because it does give them a very very strong Frontline for the pokers if they would have basically been saying okay the other team definitely Up For Debate that's why I said you can stand up in the jungle is in to make it a second play the split here for the team TSM against fighting first place the wind tie for third with you got a very instant pot leave here at the triste are coming through York yeah I'm pretty excited to see Chris Eric I've seen an increase in Calista actually seemed a little bit of playing lck and I'm seeing a star to explode in solapur so I think told us that Eric will have a little bit of a come back because that also makes the initiation for the Tariff better but the trick here cuz you mentioned if they do window till aggressive they actually do it I don't see it happen I would like to see The Grand Tour come through think there's definitely the chance to do so she assumes new-look roster had a disappointing couple of years attended almost only knew one of LCS finals for like six years or something and then it was a catastrophe catastrophe kept shaking up the roster did Tim around though I think they have the play I can make it work the doll experiment with a huge question for a lot of people TSM look like you're an upward Trend I've been very impressed with our talks for the games and also from the sounds of it is attitude so far in the split it looks like even though there have been time for potential struggles for TSM it seems like they've been able to bounce back they've gone through such a weird he split already freaked they started O2 they've been had back-to-back 200 weeks into another 02 yeah and now we're looking for another two hours in fact both of these teams egn TSM are looking to find 20 weeks EG beating liquid earlier this week TSM. He's really this week and it's a big step forward with how compacted the middle of the standings are very important in this game really really big deals at Four Winds right now and then just outside of playoffs relief in a big tie for keep going you know between 6 and like 9th Place and and yeah we're at we're only halfway in and do close to determining which teams are in a route aside from probably Cloud 9 and CLG at 50 games choose one better than frog and Victor record that we flashed up in the last game was the 13 now I know this game is in the past but I didn't get a chance to talk about it in that game and there's not much happening this year the game and actually aside from last year we had Iran golden Guardians had a rough go in the NLCS there was a time where frog and actually had the lowest LCS win rate of any active LCS player like it was a tough first couple years for frogging but this year has obviously been more helpful for dignitas as they are sitting at 5 and 5 in currently tied for third depending on the results came and left listen for frog and his team TSM of course the same spot right here five and four puts them temporarily win percentage wise alone in third but that's not always a fair way to say things as well in their record really push to bot Lane go see it sends waves during expectation based on Champion much easier just a sin away of down I will say this. Try to meet Wednesday to spot people out the Rock coming and lost flash speaks volumes to bang not so obvious and also neither of these lanes were really thinking about killing the other team based on summer stuff so I can get some cryptic and chelated carry ignite biofrost but instead they did heal Tera teleport in Cary and on the other side you have you know a guardian bromwick exhaust so neither of those were like combat that's really level to power Spike that's not something where you wanted to bring to Summer spell soda sink down bought as you mentioned it back down anyway regardless though it's the first wave pushed in first couple levels pushed in 47 we'll see what happens to wav bounces afterwards as they finish pushing a mechanic to be in the top spot on his own side putting in a lot of damage on broken play around to everyone wears fence Karen has been this entire why call band biofrost Gusto Frehley rocket jumping in the chair like that that would be an incredibly risky move if darlock had invaded to spot on Spence Karen but I will stay there all that Vision. I've got on Spence Karen did not come with any kind of junk so is actually had what I'd call a successful first 3 minutes 45 seconds against we really can't stop you have to cancel ready and then ask for more than half as well if a trade blow a little bit low but has that during very early on a feeling it's really comfortable is a house is 1 CF but he'll be fine to hold the weight up with a stomach issue you can Jackson Trading back and forth to do Kay Whitmore CF but the more farm for Gibson to grab is he says he's been fleeced of the Wavin for me down by two. Pretty soon you could almost make us play biofrost you actually rolled up is what really enabled at play to take the Q in with the Terex done meant that the timing of Spence Karen / had to be incredibly precise if you flash too early then that erick's done and we soon will follow to kill for sure he had a flash in that Split Second after lease and landed and before the Terex done detonated really really close to first Wednesday night time is there a good play turns out this guy was nice and that's a flash down and took her inside to EG missing two classes so far the early game mostly on some pretty solid out place from TSM as the pot is pushed in and how big is not willing to freeze this if it's hard to freeze as Bristol get me wrong yeah but if you want to hold the wave on his side he could for about one way if I don't know no money 12:30 go to the parts of the wave if a non Canon wave the next wave coming in with the Canon Swift and for as much as we've had some close calls in the year of the game where Papa and biofrost for things / early and our talk with the biofrost real nearly killed Spence Karen Huger has not broken at all they have actually out Farm TSM a little bit in your looking mostly spent here and having a small gold beef and also Kumo just like getting to be set up in the top of the gun store and had that spiders and still nothing really have consequences happened early on in this game just a couple close calls started Making Waves clear effortless bank doesn't the TV to answer the TV that's all they had kind of pudding that's not much of a surprise down there if they trade blows then had to go for shein Delta stock this year defensively Dusty combat stats to battle the shoving really the Great Pumpkin Blaze solo kill I don't think I've seen it oh my I know that Orin has some really good kill combos is zelle free food some of them during the pre-show but that is not something that you expect to see shout out to Broken played on that nicely done. W cool down from Google to do KU campus to go back up let's go for round two flasks with the yeah it takes two to tango you got to do a big I'll plan orange but you also should be getting yourself killed on sat here he's fine he was fine right now right yeah I mean he had a fully stacked Concourse just enough Mana for the combo gets acrylic nice like prox21 and then she was like he was just as he actually he's the flash but didn't realize it hell yeah I lose you know down the 10% and then I'll be fine but there any time is up who is also very strong self righteous man are one makes you Bruno and then heading to knock up triggers brittle for like 2. Max Health family and that is TSM feeling pretty comfortable by the way he had such good first Blood
