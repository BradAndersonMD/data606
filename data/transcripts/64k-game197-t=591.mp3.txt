and both of these organizations made it to the semi-finals World Championship in full also won their game on game guess who comes in this one I think is very real and fairly heavy favorite the Cloud 9 is his international team who is never matched up against to do with this setup if the rift Rivals game what place they were all over the place now it's T9 with lavenderall right well I dropped off here as well but they left off the Tiana this is something that we heard from SS earlier than it is a big risk to leave that out the pantheon has been busy 310 fan the respect from the Stinger is bigger than from there and then also the Yas will like it hits the letter of 70. Ruthall right all right I'll still love every time the scientist build it for breakfast one of the most comfortable camping so much resources in the mid game where you have to watch out for it every single time you like and one thing that I feel like you to is best at expressing the go button at the right time and they have given themselves so many tools to do so I can pull it off so pretty devastating 6 / 52navigate social science course good at listening in most matches right being range of course helps the push of course helps and if someone comes in you can buy something right back out with maybe not enough tools to re close the gap body fun to watch 4 Tucson at tends to be a mid laner nowadays but she can still be moved around cuz I have to work on as well pretty risky to get engaged now but the miasma could be used for Yankees and sometimes struggle in these early Laney faces against the all-in power of a Chicana for a Casio kids with levels 1 through 3 can be very very volatile so I would like to set up for himself and then get Kathy strong massive to be favored in the Cassiopeia orifice on in the lampHagar bands going away for the important ones are of course very good stop the engages GT wanting to make sure that their engagement coming through Nautilus no surprise and rakan matchup that was almost always be expected support down there was Joey comes through almost certain in the middle courseworks acting xayah rakan. The bottom Lane but you never know for sure so we pick right now because you speak last night for the Cassiopeia and ristana TWP into the fight on top of a lot of different options also see a truck coming through for liquor if this is something that we saw impact play in tune Aubrey's bladimir and even though the farm fairly well early the atrox does have the cell peeling inability to build feeling the doctor later so can actually stand up to it in the side length of a 5 Seconds to see whether not grand entrance dance from Mickey D's there be a lot of power to have a much smaller minimum Cactus so it used to be that African would just get inside cassiope is rain is nothing catch up with you about it now it's a nautilus to put down all of his CC as well as a ton of pictures on the side of Cloud 9 as well as a scaling DPS press this one is going to be a great one you know as well as far as doing fanchant because they both have considerable means I tells about 80% to 2 what no matter where you are and I'll always come out of the four battle is I think it was back in 2016 people didn't know how to chance do you know why they would try and do the same tempo is TSM but it was a true Stovall team name and they just get lost, and then I have to on the closet so we settled on let's go see knife which allowed them to Jewel so even though the fact that these are both two syllable names but 9 is bigger than 2 but G2 mean while taking their own Bread Basket Englishtown they're heading into the bottom Lane there is nowhere to go with that one all right bladder gets his leafless blew up in this site Flappers passing I just always want to hone in on the new player on the roster and 1/2 impact this early game we're seeing him start on the bottom side of the Jungle and what would not surprise me at all it's a team go for a for Camp clear and then maybe we'll make something happen around the top way clear all those Bots I can't pick up your Red Bluff and then potentially confessed to be 1 or a 2 V 2 around the atrox hbox always going to bring a lot of power in early skirmishes especially against the life of a flat Amir that impression right now with the klepto as well as The Clapper because it's quite a shocking move from the outside to see the North American MVP subbed out in their game against you two as they have two level two or right before do not get straight there so what I think is going for is a sense of all children's music events Karen was the best early-game jungler in all of the ALCS is Diego's is thinking about going through his teeth except actually had even better or the games Ben Spence Karen J Jeff blabber kind of fell apart between 15 and 20 and you goes I think I'm cool down while I was going to walk out camps right there for bladder only able to find anything Bill Walton belaying was a trade I can't help it feel like this is going to be fine with that because now he will have access to that Rocket Jump and ankles won't be able to be able to close the gap on Jana depressed now look at it yet goes back and forth are going to flash lift now in the Keanu use that to make Midland more volatile there a cure for too long wondermix a call that the pressure in the Top Lane is more important than helping Yankovich was God oh God oh crap that's a likely achieved call where ya ankles will say don't worry about it or not because he has a clear and Elena sort of Frozen Tomatoes The flapper has been in this game not only with that are the Gamecocks playing but standing his ground inside the river knowing that Vladimir Rome's down it's not going to be able to match up if licorice on his aatrox come down as well so with this strong level 3 jungler flapper has now taken control over both Scuttle crab and by burning flash on Captiva Zoe and means that Misty can actually have kill threat in this Lane by charging up that 444 W also looking at the Gold already gold 4 minutes and 1/2 inches four-laning it itches little advantage of the crossword 501 destroying this Lane with his kleptomancy only have time to burn to poop even after bladder has gone for that so be really late space for liquor today trucks definitely tricky you are able to kill sneaky in Lane right there and find active fires back after losing 60s in the face going up against power is back with his teleport as well do opting not to go for the combat Summoner in this one and they would have actually been the thing to save himself even with the death of the Top Lane D to deal with in 900 gold face through for a person out and burned a lot of dance makeup light fight again and we see licorice getting a pull him in on the W by everything even if he uses the pool right there it's still will drag him back towards the center of the ability and now he's just trying to buy time for Yanko she was on the top side map to run on over here but licorice land absolutely everything is being able to knock them down without Ransom of passive watching what happened in the bottom line is well kind of catching up since we're watching the beginning of the atrox play see how they end up pulling off the skillet just too straightforward engage on Mickey but immediately on their power level as soon as a golden little for they know they win that Alwyn actress ass and if your skill points very far behind arms to keep them all for a large amount of that return I think you'll end up dropping about 40 gold office. Purchased but will mean that they can apply more pressure in these lands and fire out their skills 54 gold total it's something like that regardless it is pretty cheap and it's a lot of man over the course of time is put good Landing item is worth of the bottom side and Tiki 6 is equal to farm for the most part but they're still playing a board the first to grab an early BS or take. Maybe it's different blade clutch sleep right there from Pepsi is not able to take these all in trade up against nisky and even the poop battle up against him because Persona is going to be itemizing into the void the Rain King Pin Lane and give pretzel Apple ever be able to do the Red Bluff is there but there is just barely was able to escape still deprez blabber for the suppression because this is why I need to see out of him to make it pay off 49th the only way we've ever seen teams reliably be able to beat G2 in the LBC was to attack them in the early to get an advantage over them So Glamorous walk here was to come in and blow the game wide open got a flat so far and he is trying to play aggressive but I need to see more and need to see especially can get some pills on the flashlight number 72 lineup now look in a game State overall remains 1,000 gold difference is the bottom line has very much been perks and Nikki centered here again up10tion that killed a walk away the garbage dumping as well not a lot of harm down there the other side knows what I'm more to put in this popside licorice text as well so here we come flashless licorice why does Britney far away what are you doing right now I don't wonder why
