to be with their storied history but you know I think C9 for them it's so important going to prove their fans that they are improving that they are getting better at it for now having traded away smoothie and Azazel is their go-to guy fans want to see daisa perform they want to see good stuff out of him as they're really kind of have confidence in Cloud 9 and basically all likelihood in the same boat as well as probably impossible to win all your games and not make plaster Point self still room to improve in room to make that postseason work a blue side a Chach Ben anything enough for TSM of course it's the first Racine up at 8:14 in North America Zoe Interstate Truck Center teleport nursetalk about during the NLCS countdown also we saw the EU LCS playlist act as well as well as North Bergen Academy Viper playing T-Mobile out of the ordinary does come out here for a standard stop it does give him the ability to create a lot of flies for himself though and to be a fairly proactive about that I want to try in the game as far as eating goes own pics of finding wait actually wrote down the bar room at the top and really 10 take over again definitely a very strong she went down in the past and is it right now in the jungle for bladder is 1 + 0 on the champion last week but of course still in the line of fear 10.9 they like the one on results bed of most there was also been so they keptthe right now by the way has won only want to see if they play again here and look how that data to see if you want to keep playing that style has brought me blocked in the site that staff for the LCS Iris Lee sneaky I was playing a ton of marksman in in the academy academy and obviously is very proficient on those Champion so certainly I could be looking for that style of Play No had heard a lot of talk from soda Pro players about the fact they thought Mark going to be moving even more back in the Middle with the TV nurses they felt the same age as we're going to more dependent on that teepee out if it does have come through or if we're just going to see more of the same style of play and then going to be lacking in was almost definitely his second Zion game of the split he himself once win the 100m otherwise I'll Mages Force are all marked himselfdefend the main starter for the entire split here for TSM is thought I am very quickly lock in this movie counter pick there and they are going to be red side so they have the ability to actually stay there last pic for licorice here as well that is certainly one of the advantages on the right side though most people are talking about blue side as having a pretty heavy Advantage because a lot of the Mustang that there are on red either way will be a good match up there for Denton and no dust out of lead me to believe that you're going to get another Mark been another kind of hiking GPS Source from the bot Lane perhaps Lulu is very strong alongside those marks in bumping them up supporting them and with Brom there also a very easy to proc that from passive with double marksman to have a lot of teams buy presents and strengthdefinitely reclined so far pretty well-rounded life not a crap to the only does so much but at least some sort of the line up right there and feed them can grab that died without much issue unless I'm in Rush Cricket which I guess it could be a possibility wait to see what comes out of this one is good places I already won final band 40s music pics of the cutoff to go for something like bleach and Brawn which is a very strong bot Lane Duo I'll grab a little bit more magic damage perhaps up in the Top Lane even with something like no magic damage healing tank like a gragas is fairly popular these days, but there's also things along the lines of what they want no Marksman who is going to be able to build more that AP style of built it up a lot of options here on the table for cloud nine kind of if you take away the Ziah are you really like denying more than your kind of hurting yourself right and I think a lot of people right now feel that work on is so strong even on his own that you feelreally need that pairing and yep vs. River, North Tazewell but before still work picking up on TSN plaid Dr munasifi the lock-in for Cloud 9 de abandonar and leave up the Darius to within a common County sick as well we'll see if I have to play that as I could come in left-hand side, but it is still very strong pic into the moon do quite as something that I've been thinking of more of it also I do think is a very very strong match up into the moon do you say fine it just kind of a safe flight take if you do want just another front liner there but it is I would say an advantageous match up for the moon do to your kind of you know self counter picking a little bit there Mundo does generally feel extremely well into all sorts of tanks and the flashing of the T-Mobile bought shut off to a Viper there from Griffin in the lck doubt I would get it when there is a possibility I like twin a lot has been expunged balling for awhile has rishta popularity recently though the last couple of months to watch out for you in 3 rolls like in Top Lane Midland Bob Lane highest win rate. Very strong Champion can be played very very well in that bot Lane and also has a lot of potential it can be can be trickier I think it's you play straight up on the champion especially when you are on the Lower Side Rangers against that you can believe it is the first time we've seen it in the NLCS is Blitz oh yeah easily and what kind of up-to-date to a fart slotland Quinn pic of at least top five reasons we had some games of it over and see if he'll also a couple of one game over opl so a couple of other reason that played botlink win but as far as the Big 5 is the price for bottling is going to be fun to watch what you do a sneaking is always been a player who has been willing to play a lot of things as well as full of Dreams every night was one of the first one of the first to be on this quick right now in North America right now it is a popular pick for himself a lot of players are seeing calendar picking it up starting to play it more I certainly can be a very powerful pick and super excited see how he is going to perform his elected to go electrocute here and we spell book on the Brom capricho stuff to go got buff I know it's one that you've given some some thought and discussion to we're basically at the super cool down a lot lower quicker and your sort of made it through a cycle of Summoners is a bit shorter as well and so you guys going to be the default Summoner of cleanse for Staples let them get away from things like that Ronnie on his back in call Progressive Place yeah I mean you can kind of with the cleanse obviously be the one who always wants to step forward and absorb that in this whole crowd control and then you can cleanse out of that I get back I will be at STP how well he utilizes it obviously feel like spell become become a stubbed in for any hanky Tiffany would go Guardian instead or after dark review sorts of things that can fit very well on your content on Brahm and even some of the top Lane Champions but if you're not being proactive with if you're not actually pretty frequently cycling through those Summoners then I think of value does go down pretty heavily the case so it is going to require some level of aggression to your court Quinn definitely an event the champion and we'll see if I can get out of this one of course not the most people of Champions absolutely can get away if you open a little bit but not always take a selfie little BTUs I do and so we'll see how that lane pressure kind of goes right now going to be that red leaves on the bottom side of me and I have a red leaking top ten Liquors will be a little bit late to Lane yeah it's amazing to see how the Sounders match up obviously sneaky is taking barrier a little bit more kind of combat Focus their on the Quinn and another has been a lot of talk about how much help we were going to see are there is no teleported us here there's one teleport on the Marksman so nothing too too crazy obviously partly that is due to the champion to the game and just head up there in a maybe Jensen would take BP again for going up against Zoe and said Juanita you do not having that cleanse would be pretty dangerous and I will watch out for all this then right now be balling being cut back and forth little tree looks like first for the sea Knight Squad ects I'm walking back as a result they know the next to his little too and watch out for Vault + Brown few that could be a 1/4 black right away. They're coming to get his Mark 5 more tax you always going to feel really good and and the important part is we just like to talk about so often is that 75 range that you get at for bounties of getting that stacked up pretty quickly as it's so so important no team fighting it in the game on at 500 range Marksman can be very difficult especially with all this engage we kind of talked about some things that stick he's going to be having to deal with obviously blabber will as well so it's always going to feels good to get off to an early start there the case right now gold 100 lead of Cloud 9 is here leaked of for the show gas comes around we're going to get a quick steel on the topside Scruggs as well and I feel pretty nice is licorice is forming under his and they're only holding up okay in the match up so as you mentioned you thought it was a bit Mundo favored and we'll watch them time goes on and we have to deal with the one you want later on but look at everything else I want to see in her step back up if you're suggesting on a high-profile championships has no e Jensen on Hulu we have seen those cameras make big plays but not that typical hard carry Champion looking at have still been pouring fairly well for so long in the NLCS when people talk about middling is ferritin and it's Jensen and those are the two guys that everyone points do those the two guys that everyone thinks are the two it really looks like they had to dominating for so long and I think it's much more wide-open these eyes have not been the clear one into a lot of people have been talking about power at fuel for example and how well he is been performing and really going to reassert that dominance shows they are still do with top-level player than that how they can perform at that super high-level net something if you're going to be able to do a bit of last week on with his talent performance which was probably I wonder if it's not his best game of the split yeah and of course more of that is what the fans want to see her cuz I was here can't feels very cleanly I'm going to get one little small chicken pretend old is Drake going to try to stop at nothing but just for sale groups might with a Scuttle spawning on this side of the map so that should give him priority with his boss Lane pushing Midland pushing to be a very very easy Scuttle Inn in Greek is even going to bother actually die trying to kontest for that so nice little afraid there for bladder in the pressure does end up resulting in in something might have been stocked as well so I thought I'd wait for going back to work and bottom side right now not singing farmlead or what does the Elijah just yes I want to paint them agreed that late route does Hertz Azle they say like yeah still a one-trait there by sneaky really nice sites that back to him very early Dragon I getting this potion Dragon free 6 minutes good feels so nice for that lady pay for them really will give them an advantage of their trying to set up the free six dive onto mood of your decisions level 6 authorization to be hard for licorice you would get to come this way but has no way of dealing with the TV back in 10 seconds is very big do for liquor she's not going to lose nearly as much the Canon is actually taking so many shots that he will lose that minion maybe a couple more but he's going to pick up most of the six. so still a nice proactive play there from TSM but licorice definitely not losing them that much and will be pretty happy about how he actually perform this as well set up from CSF trying to get that dive down for licorice prefix re kanken quite a couple shots there but no then got to stuff a coffin and maybe should have picked a couple more shots before actually treated me aggro it felt like yeah I there it should have been on hanser from the start that he tries to flash out or Gretchen take more shots with his passive and and have waited till he was lower but it was a little bit halfway and he dropped a growth then traded away and definitely agreed it could have been played it better it was very nicely done there from Licorice and as a result is not going to be too behind whatsoever you know what I'm talking about that match up a little bit it is kind of pill got that gets to push early on but especially when you're looking at this on the map is Flavor was spotted on that Wards so hot there should be aware of this you know something we're Moodle built so easily into Mr anytime I'm playing Ludo and there's three magic damage dealers on the top side feels like a very easy games in early because sidhwani
