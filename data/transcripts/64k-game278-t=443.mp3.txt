deals are the top three in a bottom 7 if they have big games to go back and neck here every game counts so incredibly much for this playoff race already a lot of these very strong solo Lane Champions we've been seeing put to use split pushing being banned out by the tide of Steel she's the ribbon the chasing band out on hit Biko very popular right now and one of the most insane until golden Guardians also following along here and also Lane band that's far we'll see what they actually get down to of course also worth pointing out in this game it's kind of educating have stuff in Moon & Auto in the Champions new and has played a single game of the earlier on and Autoas previously I asked him about it when he was in makeup earlier today though and he was very impressed but I'm back in the LCS trying to make the moves it's definitely one of the academy players that has had a transmission on and off the LCS stage for many years. Very good player Tennessean come up as well steal she had a good track record of bringing up your won the ALCS in his very first split replacing weaker as of late but you have high hopes by file frost date for scampi and himself is Raven's rest comes through that's going to be exciting as well to see what the sport pick will be I was expecting a little bit higher priority on the super early game jungler like recti here but the West pic of Jarvis has been locked in earlier at people who rememberis Darvon game that you did very well into a j switch difficult matchup and he was able to speak as out Fiesta Jace actually do that jungle filled their options open will do it to it looks like you go but the options going to be the love lock midlane for frogging did not win I'm a champion that hasn't better on street fighters are poke but on the champion here to take to take over from the game and personally I did think that he was a good LeBlanc but maybe the team not necessarily accustomed to that really work as well when you have to play differently Novant looking to clear out towards find those pick off a hundred percent is 0 somebody has been go for the objective or the team fight not necessarily their similar strategy we've come to know and love with the lake that have come through for himself it's already looking likeRavens rash bottom line early on that we hypothesize what would happen more in the LCS as time went on with everyone sticking Azrael and just kind of waiting through the lane phase when will teams start to play a little bit earlier start trying to punish that go for the dominate them blankets for a place to get dragon I'll definitely in early in Domination lineup here for ggf blowing up yetis real important things up but that seems quite not quite as strong as other times they might play so wait to see if the bands coming through cinder blocks from power of evil York band away is the LG I will have to probably guarantee their actual top laner before we ever see what how to fix the top light. Driving can be flexible to the fourth York one of the Olsen Champion sociology last Mega to be Leaf then been away from contracts contracts definitely has utilized least in as well as early other early games Wranglersget frog and a head I think that has been one of their keys to success in these five victories has been contracts visiting groggins Lane early that allows fragen to completely control his Lane and especially on a champion like LeBlanc if they pay it forward strategy where the jungler can canker LeBlanc and Matt LeBlanc get to level 6 you're way more powerful than a jongleur going to get ink and sohila Blancos and take the different Lane to get everybody ahead so the rise been locked in the Box going to see where he's going immediately afterwards or hovering a zillion somewhat blind pop when we know a cartoon of course jungle and that would be just fine I know blank is something that actually be going into the mid lane to answer the blocks half-blind top and we actually goslightly more popular jungle sales in professional play and I especially so loves you will see 10 and his Premier Lane bully basically right now don't you start the tragedy they're they're going to go for it but it does mean that are 100% all in on it earlier Focus bag that we talked about with the Raven bottom line China boy with the LeBlanc looking to get control early than roam around now they also have a massive advantage in Lane in power for the Top Lane Advantage year with a range champion this is going to have to be golden Guardian setting the temple and TOD trying to weather the storm which honestly has been the situation I still do you have been in a lot of their games they have usually picked more feelings than their opponents half in the particular game and try to rely on waiting till later than bringing the tank through and getting the heart of gauges off will it is darshan on spy on Spotifyseason when he's on a champion kind of logic gaming here 5 and 7 alongside Golden Gardens he's tied for fourth place are absolutely within read and is absolutely in the car's Bluetooth module see if they can in fact the cheapest as I get us loaded into the game we will see who strikes first DLC making some last-minute switch is here as we head into the real thick of the playoff race bringing in two of their Academy players very excited and it was five straight weeks of the same players same players in and now very late in they are such a get back around that I hope it's the right to go in the postrocking on your screen and it's time to go into some of those Rich counter logic gaming face and golden Guardian he was six games left to play alright summer Leaf anxiety coming down looks like defensive opening for both teams as they spread out cuz we going to try and get your early Scuttle crab Lord down if you were these jugglers are going again like we had talked about in champ select we expect the early phase to be readily important for Golden Guardians and especially contract so we'll see if you can get any early information on that aatrox jungle cuz he has so many options of all the lanes have a possibility of setting up ganked and being very aggressive it's very important for steel G to try and track the enemy jungler so far we have a lull in the early game and if you wait for this one to start in Earnest if you want to hear more about the golden Guardians and arrow joint Kobe is a love myself on the dye for he mentioned that he's preoccupied with being involved in the conversation for top teams in this week's episode to hear more from him about Golden Guardians so far this year of all the top and he just wanted a crack at them to be able to exploit what he saw was wrong you know with TLC 9 yet Sam hopefully they've also got strategies for sale cheap that is one of the most important games here trying to get a win and deliver a loss to one of your competitors for the playoff spots could easily be your quarter-final phone as well save some how you perform so it could be a very important match up and of course I do they make the playoffs between your quarterfinal certainly in the cards for each of these two teams if they try to shape up in time for what's essentially week 10 van service in 4th Street Metro in flight tickets Autotext down and feeling some decent damage kleptomancy E Auto auto will of course trigger twice they are in so far so good bullying sign if you expect in the early game I am curious what his eventual build will be starting play does not mean you're not going to go a few later on if you goes a p me to get to Dayton flight to try to pick off that bottling Ezreal later on at the team fights did you go attack damage your old fart very good and you're dedicating his foot couple of options open I feel like especially against died on the on hit can be very effective because it does include special damages with the blade of the ruined King but again if you're trying to end the game through forcing at the objectives and you're not 100% committed to the split pushed that's where you see the AP pills come in defensive ghost or was not going to stop contract and take him with his bluebuff but that said both sides her and take you to the struggles regardless so not all that important otherwise yeah I mean so you remember about the ghost Braswell this game oh my goodness that is exactly the way you want to start off a Draven game crashes into cash in that much cuz it's so early but he gets the first Blood Money it's just a great host Viola way right past the Canon minion there and definitely doesn't hesitate The Flash Sable to pick up the kill what a rough start for auto here coming into the LCS the support just gets hook not much he can do doesn't have Hela to teleport Azrael can do anything to save the time cash and now it is going to be packed box number one for this early game composition emphatically checked absolutely and honestly it does feel like a tomcat just one of the better Champions to kill he's actually incredibly level dependent for his tanks and have any active take pills outside that and it flashes down his exhaust system in the bottom line instead of a combat Summoners you cannot help your support out everything set up to fill biofrost it did happen here and I'll be there another one now he's white Top Lane side as well as darshan getting worn down below 200 hp actually it's getting all that close and that will have to be a TV back to Lane I want to see contract start to play aggressively here with the atrox is going with his first clear so I was going to reverse clear now the rest of the camps but with these very powerful Lanes we talked about in champ select you want your jungler to utilize that pressure take away from the enemy jungler so that not only are still losing but you also want to try and make their jungle lose because their lands cannot come support them I'm watching the jungle camps bit later on right now I got to find out how rough that recall was for darshan he gets just the rejuv who can I feel pretty bad right there Hunter she converts his staff back to Ability Power by buying this The X Factor revolver which it lets him get the damage attack but also you have no less attack damage over all cuz you're around I'm not even sure it's only item but in these device and slinking around and the revolver definitely is super valuable for harassment will see about the bottom side of the map do because it's a very good movement here from moon to slip in and grab the Scuttle crab before the bottom-line returns and it's something that people should pay attention to a little bit more as recall timing during the recall hear of this very powerful event to go to spend that first Blood Money get his extra fuel Bixby F sword first year you have a small window on the map a little bit less than 30 second to try and do something on the bottom side get to Scuttle crab you get permanent Vision here leading into the dragon and a little bit of defensive security and of course she talked about that I recall timing having the money for the BS or in the second or inflated for the stuff to be here on traven very easy boss texted up to you and W and you have a cast animation you just have to turn them on twice anyway and that works out pretty well for him and he's got money and he's going to try to think you to keep trying to cash in right here but he's dead Over Heels about the attack speed I really really do think you just mark it is finally getting the recognition it deserves as well as helps you guarantee those Powers bike in the rain and now the health bar for auto extremely low. Just last post and you sucking right now in the golden Guardian on the bottom side they're going to force them off of this have to give us a place for space Auto wanted to jump all the way around and it was that where you went but it will be through the extra gold coming in. I think it's time to put down and they got it in Fox Sports 4th of Red Bluff in Bay Pier didn't stay around to finish off this current place as you can see it hasn't fallen yet still have five I do like that though they're listening to the PSA come help your jugular we are making a play in bedding for the Red Bluff power bill gets changed but it is Aftershock rise during the W in the Blancos it's so not really I will say though gigantic Farm lead to frog and Eve with this picked up it's still a fuss 5 or so see if it'll leblanc's is going pretty well for him and go to the Guardians on some of a full court press winning everywhere 15 is a really sad but again we've remember this is sort of unexpected game State through the Champion Select maybe not this big of a lead with you early first blood but this is a more early game 4
