one thing that surprised me was actually the four players been scaring that game the defending MVP also the former jungler of Cloud 9 who has been replaced by blabber now she needs to step up in order for EG to have a stronger Canton this year most certainly have been expunged performer even throughout play out the first one and 1/2 game since you know has been good but if you see 9 a league above with band. It is getting rid of grogginess their kind of afraid of that red side jungle pick up their syndra off early embarrass off really in with the hell has been coming through at me is easy cuz I don't think he was playing the way the side so I can work in playoffs those you who don't know is C9 gets head stuck in the first game and inside collection future games determined by whoever lost the last one so EG had side button and they got your shoes blue and already we see a vastly different draft mainly because the band chain so much callista was banned LeBlanc was planned and Olaf were all banned in all available champions for this one that callista very early on was pick and I'm not sure if we're going to see it through your rotation LeBlanc NCG just reverse around its Kumo time to play drunk last night without jungle interventions and we ever see what cloud Diane answer they know topic as the pantheon get locked in that was that blocked in we noticed they were going to flex their mid and jungle spores later now those are you watching on ESPN 300 First to break you to stick around and I also think with the pets Lawton buy C9 so far that's was very passive forestry fiction Cloud 9 and definitely gives easy some opportunity to play aggressive very early on I like the Caravan because the collective terrorist is the most common Lane and I see with Calista is close to set so neither of those are going to be available for EG when I was kind of starting how maybe EG would be able to be T9 it would be if they can get through the early games with Stephen Gould maybe the shock hauling experience of Spence scary as well as put forth of June would be able to find the victory what's happening in this draft is there so it's more like golf but really going to have to turn down afterwards because their pics are going to start falling off if you need it later find some way to just like stiff the front lines together and have no one hit back line forever and that's not okay so I tend to agree it's getting pretty bored I'll be stable knows how good that can be but maybe if you will pops off and you don't listen to get to play League of Legends and every single team fight and then it looks different around 7 how to fix the one that cries yeah I mean with whitthorne as real Tom locked in it's like all of cloud Nine's aggression needs to come from this jungle mid-combo if they do not hurt again I mean gleyber is powered by symptoms of Nocturne not being an effective really getting pissed because he's been able to farm at a fast-paced and effectively counter jungle very well and always hit stick first so that's what they're going for here but I mean like if EG does something like Pantheon Thalia with mid jungle that seems like a pretty devastating truly to prom with anything this key plays made here except his own I have talking about here is just going to play Snow White's coming through with the cats if you have an for sure and it navigate to be brought the tools they are getting the rise. Either way whether it's going to be the pantheon of the tunnel bottom line it's going to be it's going to be interesting and I don't dictate where they're going to be playing through it feels like not worth trying and let's see if I can get some kills into the spell shield is going to be really crucial for blabber again Pantheon in some of these Early Trades cuz if you actually see if you actually spell shield the pantheon W there's a lot of your lethal Tempo Dam itself in terms of how Nocturne get behind and how much of the lethal Tempo timing can fence during walk off into game to shortly we've got it all new draft and it's a lot of early game pressure with one nice little piece which is a hectare rice kills pretty well that just to kick in take a licking team fight and it got trundle and support to siphon off of the tanks that there was a little bit of extra texture and those last two pics that makes me a little more optimistic about the EEG Bob smiley emoji late game but yeah there early game is Wicked Strong you've got a Calista in there for letting face at 6 to go throw the trundle in which is I would argue one of his little weaknesses as a Frontline or is he just have to walk very elegant is around those going to look a lot nicer so go on summoner's Rift Evil Geniuses I are going to slowly running to turn in this series around 5910 start in the best-of-five and I'll also say that they still has been putting in more time than most on some of the more unconventional support fix just because they were really are on on the Losi scte kind of tank for support place out there actually would have get it in some of their grass before it became permabanned so Calista is somewhat similar how to say a Santa in that it can unlock different support pics to work the early laning phase like turnovers Tom pinch turn off snowcast a check or so I don't necessarily think that that's a melee going to get pushed in and then it level 6 plus the trunk and get really cranky by altering orange or the time spent so that might be very good and then the other bit of texture think about how the track played out is Zoe is Miss Keys most played by far V's coaches notice but they decided to ban Cassiopeia Cassiopeia is generally speaking a better Lane matchup Enterprise than most so I'm thinking that he actually wanted this rise into Zoe match up and it's going to be a little bit of a skill check whether or not is ukr net Seafood winning all right well because the early jungle path from licorice getting around near the Red Bluff is going to be a quick invade to get svenskeren basement boards won't even be seen taking the Red Bluff initially especially if he never goes into the front and some of this researching your opponent's whatever habits where the wards go how do they defend their side of the Jungle would have liked to see spend find a way to do that camp-out ever going upwards and never showing on that work yeah I think so he doesn't necessarily know if it's warded and it is hoping to to make sure he's getting away from his Nocturne could be doing a blue straight to Red path for Blu Grand Street to read and he wants to be able to show that to my cousin happened just like as a little bit of security but because you stepped on that Ward it is it going to be totally fine for black look like he's a faster jungle clear defense Karen and licorice might actually fun till the K Street here in Jungle but he is going to try to spend the time to 4 Spence Karen off the way the others should Zoe spell tease flat but that's not crowd control Kumo get to make him you know hide back but I do want to point out that because the wave was pushing away from licorice his minions were denying Mac Mini next electrician to physically down in experience because he went to stop the front yeah but also been scaring his Defender Of A Down to experience three camps the five from bladder right now and blabber can easily take to Scuttle crab in the bottom River to keep roughly a to Camp Advantage so again blabber with an early farm advantage on the Nocturne but it's whether or not Spence Karen can make something work email flax what's ganking Zoe but it could have gone to the flash of Howard room for them and then maybe the Panton follow up as they are bats obviously if it was okay the camps. He's going to be speared he's going to alive but there is all the damage of two games in a row Niskayuna bladder to buy for First Blood big mistake really big mistake from Spence Karen trying to deny the Nocturne a level six path when his entire blue side is up Spencer and can easily just Farm safely as a flash with Patheon who will lose any to choose against the Nocturne Zoe at this point because he's under level so just a really big really game for mistake there by Spence Karen kind of supercharging blabber and misky and Blake and his walk-up they see him he doesn't have health does UK has no Mata so there's no way he's going to actually be able to support them and it's an easy first blood from his be very large V wave hitting Kubo you going to stop a can of any good about your health back then type back of the van is going to drop a car on all side now licorice temporarily actually has lovely he's 5% double knockout number three lights flatbed from the town's been scared but it's not going to be enough because this is why you're on the academy team and licorice has been stepping up throughout this play off he destroy someday in the first round series and now aatrox firstborn smashed as the atrox OR vs. aatrox not to ask her just after he gave up early experience to push send scared out of his jungle and it just goes from bad to worse they might be there because there are three be one who's going to fill a growler licorice sounds the horn finds Binaca blast was going to be there for the beer as well there is no chance to do literally anything for whom he was powerless and he's gone again oh dear oh dear I just not looking like they are relenting at all I mean if you can't teleport up just because he sees a huge wave there that he knows who can't read so he's he's trying to salvage the remnants of that lane call Matt you got to be freaking kidding me. There is probably a massive smile on Liquors in space right there he got away with that one. Just UK it was the model have to see if one of his cues didn't bounce but this was a whole sequence of plays that we have to go back for so this was licorice chunking down Kumo very low before the eventual Pantheon Gates actually comes in about 15 seconds so we might be in for a little bit of a ride you can just see like the clothes trading liquor has conference the whole time he knows his damage he's kept just enough Mana to have this kill lantic you just flashing behind the cue to of the atrox and Dennis is Lil Baby level 3 Pantheon with a blue buff and can't really do anything left to try and finish him off so yeah mm Gold by 7 minutes looking for in Top Lane and licorice won the HR soaring by about twenty CS had some threat Fred ever got a plate by himself 3 on 1 yep he's a he's Off to the Races and Plastics by the way so give Dale and asleep anywhere they can go for the game as they they might just continue to dive off plane because he is The Flash's player but if there's UK's rise for his up I would see and no hesitation from blabber to Alton try and kill him the Flash Players top and mid lane Mercer police are done so that is a defensive operators okay that can help a little bit we have a nice time the bus by City
