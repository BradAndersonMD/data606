Stacy and will stop with the Bracketology patio with Ricky level with right now because they beat them with the fiana rumble last time but you I don't like to see been away so many kind of mint defining picked as the blue side team often times you want to kind of for the other team has many bandsdisrupted into the game being able to speed it up Kaiser rolls result liquid trying to that last name of the length but we know the way that they hate you like to do that it true have you squirming around Ray both trying to drag the early to the play because he is one of those dark areas on this line up so I like the fact that most of the bands that played already gotten rid of the key on a rumble however they got 22nd to make the choice to decide if they really do want to do that but I think putting your eggs in a basket as a good choice between liquid and now I'm coming if you are a hater what do you have in response to pick is it going to be I was going to say maybe if I cuss or Vegas cuz I can't even remember how to pronounce that that be as nice as real as a thing you can play and desire Uzi try to many times yesterday to mixed success I think one of the more important things that age he was going for is the German take away it's something that they banned again in the first game and it's something they wanted for themselves here I think that she'll probably end this was our economy progress will have to see I think it's time to take down going to lock that one in and then we'll see if they do indeed go for that same jungle matchup TL one thing we did see if them at MSI where they made it to the finals they beat the rush Champions Invictus gaming was it wasn't about that bo5 and now we'll see if he wants to bring out something else that's unique to them as they go around and okay yes Jensen second game of the block here I can see it I think that the champion pool is going to get a little pinch in the second phase of bandwidth based on the way. Jensen performed in the last game they played where he died a bunch of times trying to get him onto a chance of that have had success on if we remember Jensen's LeBlanc against someone would probably his best game of the group stage so completely understand why there was a block here laundromat cost would increase and she now really struggles to be able to deal with the way I played Philip Lowe Windsor pushing this matchup that has very good priority On the Run Tour if your eye play the Lincoln Tunnel is involved for Rainbird model before Jensen to take something like a cleanse however I feel like it is no longer a proactive matchup I feel like more options are available for Jensen to be able to take over the map it's more of a late-game counter because the cool downs and the Mana cost recovery so even if you're willing to print reminder for what are the game Utah plane often that you get the last pic of this entire drafted you support any they most likely toppling over to clean option at least a juggler out of TL being the top down bottom light disrupt a lot of the aggression is going to come out of liquid now the problem is is when you play these Mage 4th and it's something like to look into dialogue options going to be a little bit it would have been mr. Eliana as far as I'm taking this is safer play for them you look at really having a place to hang stuff for the topside here it could be the last day of world to know it goes are they going to put impact on a camera that you can have an impact on the game liquid point of impact with bright Global accent and maybe the best aggressive bottom line and jungle on the back text Missy and TL has had it so far in this world championship self quite happy about this rap for to look at in Wolf will see what I was going to do because it looks like they ended up going with a lot of countermatch think like I said at the time thing maybe we'll end up seeing this in the quarterfinals but this was also several days later and now I'm going to throw this one out there right ideas what The Simpsons Simpsons fans Yeah Usher the first 300 episode that one now and then he's like why doesn't mine look like that I feel like when you have a look at liquids wine upright it's like to fix it all fits together every night but you kind of see on the side of a heck you and you see where it's going to look like that I feel like it's just such a straight to go backwards when you have a supremely hot and gate 80 carry one and only North America well we got some Team Liquid fans in the audience and of course plenty watch down the street right now TL the last DLC sahq sadly entire league failed to make it out the LMS but I can play spoiler here once again we have a very scientific, coming out of Lakewood you understand exactly what this composition wants to be able to do that have a very good movie to win the ball of my day going to look to gain pressure in the mid lane rotate football team. They have the Gangplank to supplement all of that however on the side of the HQ that have picked purely for Lane County is I failed and when you do that you must win lanes and it seems like they at least have CC follow-up to chain with the Jarvan gang so she will probably look to either to be to mate and then crash that pressure by Saints vs just wanting to be to ask you is going to be looking to either kill Jensen or go up top and shutdown impact I'm with the one thing I will say about the HQ, is I feel like they do come online Strat slightly Alia Azrael at to Wadhams outperform is most 80 carries that I currently in metal specially wants to transport of the Moon romantic is there as well as lissandra also just great pick tools in the midday so I feel like he hates you were going to have to win do around 15 to 20 minutes to set up the math and look for those kills I want to point out when did Crouch you for Jensen Auto going rainbow once it's actually bigger than it looks gold plating on cool down the next time he does go for a quick second. Has the top win his fight back and forth by the way for the GP again grasping too much more common Keystone in front of what he can is ziv will try to push down how to see how that one place. I feel like that's a very risky move by impact because she'll got to something that can actually match GP with early trade part of the way that you could get through level six and starts killing these items is he so strong really early on with grass Auto tax to be able to proc that impact can't do that here so he's probably going to be giving over some Lane priorities is it just cho'gath if you can stack up the grass for the undying you can pray very efficiently with the poly that's a trading patent we see was it keeps away fairly neutral have the package going to continue to push the wave ever is able to trade on to him he'll kill him and then the danger of pushing away is if you think any fire Russia you might just die anyway is Itachi dominate this matchup when he played cho'gath vs. Gangplank it was within early gang so so really we'll see how that works out as rainbow you can already taste even the fact that he has been Trading you can shut the wave that quickly make it strong for the Saundra as well ran forward to dodge the change and then get the full trade out there as well as when I pee pee on Jensen we sometimes speaks lens on the Block to get out of the flash engage combos that there will not have that luxury of eight levels gate comes in however it is important to note the fact that Jensen still does have a potion available where is Rainbow I just choked through every child right now is a corrupting potion so whilst he's parody in the HP was that is going to be a slight Advantage for the TL mid laner this is a problem right now with lysandra she is very resource-intensive outnumbering is a fight of his bottom River we've seen these fights go in a sling for LCS teams before they're still sticking around Dublin but still Alex taking a bunch there double for the flash awake or fast as flash as well as spells were on cool down in that looking to look at more outside I actually had the lane party in the bottom lady but he's been so long on the Scuttle crab it allows Azrael to make it all the way in the River end Double if he's the one that's getting caught out normally when you have black Friday if you just stick with your younger the other team can't do this to you but double it next to figure out of safe and then they think they're in the clear after flashing the wall but rainbow then has the mid-length push willing to commit everything to get to Route and that book is a screw the early Edge and the decisiveness from a hate you I feel like this is what we sold last time they played against liquid appeal is a game plan and again we see you once again everything thrown in there that's going to be a flash used on Alex as well as rainbow But ultimately they do get the kills a native where's the teepee out of ss with his hairy awkward purchase there a long sword and a dagger components of later items see if they can turn that one around right now 900 goldleaf puts HQ ahead about what you expect for early kills like those and now it's a flash plus bottomley team liquids stronger to be too is what they want to be able to play through but it's so difficult now that they don't have River control and they don't have flashes on either of those players so they're not really able to place your top anyway it's meant to be weak side top of the fact that the strength of their team now has to play conservatively will put Team Liquid behind for a good portion of this game and he will be able to get level 5 of the two remaining Camp II buff he's going to spawn a couple of minutes so when you have a look at how this game should play out he should end up on the bottom side of the map with that ultimate with a flashlight bottom line to attack TV comes back in the top side now as well and I'm just to get pretty decent recalls on both sides and packed with shein plus an extra Mana regen and this is how you got the full ninja tabi is there to that David can chase the point of downright no boots in the game plank that can make things really really scary nice route right there guarantees the Aftershock gets on that trades not to have him Jensen wonder where the next play is going to be cuz it's also a level 6 lesandro that often wants to try and go aggressive that Twix Mitzi is your shadowing Jensen worried about this play the Choo Choo from the sodder level 6 is pretty strong still I thought was only magic resistance as well so should be able to shrug off a lot of what Smitty's damage and Jensen's damage is at the same stage of the game no penetration picked up and you can see that he's very cranky was surprisingly thank you for this day to the game HQ can do here because they've had a few advantages throughout this group stage that they have been unable to close out as Alex move towards bottom and they're looking to pin for a little bit we're coming down spotting him but with the wave controlled as it is to control where dies just after it's placed under a difference for that kind of situation for it because the start of every good aggressive play is control and look how much of that they have on the bottom side without flashing very hot 40 L to be able to push out in that bottom right now that be invaded in the bottom side jungle you can say that this Alex more choices he can I dilute account of jungle maybe go for that Red Bluff once it respond power it dies always going to be on the table and it looks like I'd say bring rainbow into the play that is what I asked you was decided last was always double if it's a boy or we three on level five here comes on in jumps for look for the old he finds the roof play Only One Direction without you in a positive situation so far as you've got a lot happening across this side of big damage is Sarah's going to go down and walk over to the air to play Two Worlds Apart of Might and you saw even with the advantage even with the early movement Gangplank ultimate just swings the tide of that died and that can be so huge for TLC
