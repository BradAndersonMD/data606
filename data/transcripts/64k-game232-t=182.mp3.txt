is that the teams are loading in the Champions like the prescription for Team Liquid is more of the same for cloud nine we're interested to see how Kumo does out here on the estate thank you very much welcome back by the first place Team Liquid the new and returning pride of North America LCS titled three-in-one at Rift Rivals against Europe's best cloud 9 hoping to see what they can do not quite at full power licorice taking time off to mow stepping in for him and stop playing and we have a battle at 2 top-of-the-table team and one of my favorite things about Kumo is that he will play pretty much any champion in the top when he plays K he plays Carrie's he plays a fee he played a d d plays range Lane reapered especially a lot of Versatility hair and that's something you always looking for with the team is how creative and again and can select so far it's a full Target of for JJ trying to get all those support band out of the common strategy vs. Team Liquid diet silkworth quite valuable keep mine still 9.12 no Athens Beaver nurse just yet on this date was Iraq on definitely great Duo one that liquid has played four times already in there a game so and I think they probably would be coming through that is the very very experienced on the champion was an answer with what's timbercon I'll probably these two premier support that are left up and they still has been able to use both fairly effectively we're vs. Ted Lonnie there's not a lot give it away so Universal tank junglers extremely powerful because they buffed up the second swing of the W damage has been taken down yet but we're still on I-12 and out tonight to make their choices they are not really concerned that taking away to saira Khan. Early on has his random at Camp has look good so far there is frontal a very common town to pick into said after shock or not good for the champion you have temporary bonus armor Mr before joining combat that can be quite a bit and I wait to see what you look at on their side and they talked about how Cloud9 take more risks than how they just want a stable opening and if if they don't you give up some sort of big play than they think they are the better team on the side family by xxxtenticon a draft in that way and draft himself some Stable Lane sick bastards wanted to work around in the jungle you have your front line tank now they've got aatrox one of the biggest spiders which impact has performed extremely well on boat in the LCS and in the international play she's not going to grab their prize Duos I reckon they willing to let that slipped down the band phase and grab other Champions League scores right now just paid to the game but I got to get up early Corky here and put that most likely on the tennis competition North America right now all rights AP Power from the mid lane here they do you want a balance of damage types of scales Gilchrist coming through as well as the Trinity Force start definitely has a lot of power duration being pushed up or I mean the package acquisition time for your first one to be a run only change it was in the normal patch notes diametrically opposed or graft yes we have a possibility for liquids unless Corky's wants to double it going to be the Zoe answer pretty common in to Corky here to move to taking that one off the table for nycki I'm definitely breaking both of those two powerful bottom Lane pieces that you can still have to look at played a lot of stone Elaine at Rift Rivals there's a couple more often. Maybe you are indeed playing Lots at Sephora Corky's in Des Moines farm and out looking for fishing for stairs to hit and such as you can bring up trundle over with a pillar they could set something up but it it down as being harassed CA Frost early I think it's a super super nice matchup for Jason signs Bend I ate rocks some snowballing is early lame take it a couple of her hit so if if they protect Kumho on the topside you know it's busy get some control the Scuttle crab be sub top winter here for cloud nine could actually become the star of the mat this could look really nice right here and not just a severe for this matchup doublelift Saint Lucia court today on Brown definitely a very strong do Elaine double as low as play aggressive Land of Illusion certainly is because he's not be played to win Lane but you know if we'll try that and up against cloud and their last call wow I don't know squat back in the world 2015 so I could be exciting and the chances of roundness key on the Veigar Mid Cape and back into it how cold play that support role first then we did get another bid Lane wine and wasn't me see how I get through the early horses farming up your AP first and the ultimate is Good vs all types of Champions first image navigate around the cage as well I kind of like this Cloud 9 style there was Jason Todd so ecstatic actually focused that area that match silver and we will try and you're clear waves and stay away from the Lucian Brom cuz just do it all over again rhyme to do and blocking is Savers a boomerang than one fighting gyms in North America are doing a battle right now liquid looks good at Rift Rivals Cloud 9 not full Powers then maybe not know how either but still a good team overall great players on the roster and it's going to be an exciting one let's get ourselves into this game as be looking at Cloud 9 space off the clothes out the first round robin how many people were super excited to see Kumho on the LCS stage she had that single gang off game on gangplank Victory now he's going to get some real time to shine Jace is something that you can really try and get out to an early lead corrupting potion picked up for your more harassment here so you try and throw out those Autos as often as you can on a Stock's Dodge back into the brush to drop minion aggro and try and get an early Health lead but with the Veigar pick anything to talk about what this game is thanks guys coach Cloud 9 is coming off of a pretty disappointing Rift Rivals running you're going against Team Liquid it's your first match back so what's the team thoughts come into today and you know we'd recovery process too. From the last Reaper driver but obviously it's really talk to play against Team Liquid right after the recovery process but you know we feel good and I hope we can play well against him because right now I'm not worried about corridor do not worry at all Reaper thank you best of luck to you back to you guys and we all know this one actually enjoy we had a lot of all chat already in this game to give you a quick rundown for those who aren't on probe you immediately Spence Terence is oh now you want to go on your teeth fair enough, getting the early harassment as in fact his back to Lane as well so we can also pick up all the kids doing it once yesterday chart unlucky in fact already falling behind an NA J's can you imagine put an NA Academy Jace not anymore in there let's go bottle filled early and they try to go just yet but it does get a bit of pressure does C9 Duo early on if they are pushing forward. Sticky using his patented skin as well with the pizza delivery Lovett trying to get there early push as you mention if they can get into the turret really they can move up Frank it a war here to see xmithie cuz 650 did starts on the blue side of the map he is going for the house and starts we can still do all these camps on the red side but it is a power clear for stage 1-e trying to farm it out extensively early going to go onstage make sure everything is in order but that is going to be my next area of focus is the bottom half of the map and it looks like dazel did use that time after pushing the minion Wave 2 bruised up and get a ward into the tribe rush so if it's Smitty does finish up the full clear is going to have to find a q over the back of the Dragon pit or something or go through the lane you can actually Lane cake with Lucien Brown pretty effectively cuz you can stack up those Dunson trying to force that engaged and neither one can blanks you can run down the left no problem either he is the one who don't know if that was because it's his issue or not but he was one who typed in the command for wait to hear what this is all about over all of it going to be in game one thing is you actually think I've heard recently from players is it likes to me about sneaky in Lane dies Lenny faces is not very good but what I've heard is actually his Lenny face has gotten a lot better these actually a very good later it's actually Azazel who is a his guilt is not so much in lady but his overall mid-game shot calling in Sault Ste nines generally slightly big Lenny face I do not speak anymore typical 80 karrie freaky rap you said you know just putting one out for my homies sneaky that he's he's not the problem fair enough. I know the last time we saw Veigar frog and was tweeting out yeah I'd love to have my team carry me for 20 minutes to inflate a car early action and yes you know you really do need to stack up the AP. To have that big threat but I always love the players that can really utilize the cage well cuz it's such a big c seat and you either need to have the skill indicator on it because the center is the center of the cage where you cast it but you need to be able to cast it with the edges touching people so you have the skill indicator on or just put enough games in on the champion that you've get the feel for the exact range and you can really see that on stage take effect you know when these guys are popping up the new high-end tents moments with big are cages actually land right on people without having them walk into it absolutely it's going to be a big thing that's why I always have a smartcast and Emmanuel Caskey buying that I just you know pop that out if needed and change between games as I was talking about Spice from all chat I think my all-time favorite one so far is Jensen go to licorice got benched I guess you come full circle now which I really enjoyed throwback to watch 2018 Cloud 9 or ring when the whole roster moves around to keep to the whole story where was the one coming up motivation time I guess sweeties on the roster has a low came in and they traded smoothie away to Echo Fox I believe and it went on from there and that's what is on TSM Azazel still starts for Cloud9 sneaky Nesta Cooper back meanwhile gentleness swap teams over to the opponents now the guy on stage here right on camera is Misty trying to play against Jensen who he has replaced for Cloud 9 a lot of people were super word possibly going to replace Jensen who was definitely an All-Star for them in the mid lane Hughes performer at the international turn especially but I really think that miss me even though he didn't have the star power when he came in has delivered a lot of the things that this Cloud 9 team needed and I was very versatile player and showing it once again here on stage with the Veigar yeah one of those early on in his career on scene I've ever talked about trying to make them more selfish player to have him more of a player ask for Gangsta filling the shoes of Jensen in a more specific away the types of things that he would do to play more aggressively actually thought he's Ripper I was pretty solid I thought his I think was the Arsenal game looks really good I think he got to steal kill and capture them I was like really impressive as well so I think he has been getting a lot better and then I am very sweet of dope to keep seeing this keep like the app people are even making the one behind jokes because everybody else on the team was really struggling and some of the games that are losing this keep fighting his heart out looks like they might have solved some of some of the issues that lead hits at least look happier so that's good that's definitely a good thing in good spirits hear it for the cloud nine sides up getting some Reddy's in chat that's good. Lower case r then some other types are going to print these Eddie the game client and everyone is safe and car and came resume 42 and 1 and some of those ripples through replacement there in space and then react alright let's see some more sense can space then maybe on one of these
