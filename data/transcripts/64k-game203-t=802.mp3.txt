is a lot of Hope for the two teams meme on Twitter against each other give us Rumble Fionna and give us a xercor keep rumbling Kiana are the two most successful fix for clutched in every game of the semi-final nearly swept them self Tiana and Corky fit another really good flexible aggressive Champion melee magic damage. Of course but getting likes to use a whole lot for sale High Pointe 15how are people who are Keanu is definitely a fixed it a lot of teams were willing to let slide through the first phase of pics and then it would end up getting banned in Phase 2 but I would stay in the past week or so we've received the present Spike barely fart showing the first take ear if it's not I wouldn't be too surprised to see if it's like blood and it's the first big for po eat the first cigarette away and he's still up there as well and the mate split so far but you never know on the table Yeah I also wonder since the mate was the player who had the most games on at what he would decide to Lane against it and if they end up walking in this Renekton which day do nowthere's a decent chance that that Renekton goes mid as far as the things that Keanu can occur again it is that fighter skirmisher type champ Tiana and it has larger GPS still coming in here from clutch and of course no surprise as well just be a leader bringing this pic forklift pacifically is 8 play of the split most play Champion Ford starter with all the other stuff is the priority for steaming I really like Star Trek II in answer to a lot of these melee assassin Iana because the ultimate could be such a good answer to any Champion that has two hard commit mail a race as well for the squad this is vog putting a lot of very aggressive male a heavy champion Black Rock for a lot of birth year on the field seaside yeah I do think that the bottom linea lot of fans towards a correction as far as overall Focus code E7 Vulcan we're actually pretty happy with how they recorded biofrost clutch might be fairly comfortable so far already Faker for SATs play the Renekton mid try and be a very oppressive and then have answers later on in the game 2 on the side of Steel Jeep is one of the best junglers to pair with this Champion being able to wash body plan is very potent early on in the game plus progress right now does provide a very good AP threat for later onTiana in this situation is going good Lane and that means a truck to be going pause Lane how to assume you'll feel because ruin was pretty much the only player to play Camille as in a prox counterpick Kaiser has enough magic damage that it would be okay to have Camille and Renekton as your soul enters and we're also thinking that Renekton is going to be a decently strong pick any kind that's what it is but that's what you have to deal with in North America for a while how come fix phase of banty or to do definitely a possibility for Clutch Gamingand I will try to make it to the final choices right now you know the right now before fan despite being file Frost boat Flight Support it's unlike one and five of the pantheon counter picks to Waycross he has married many games for three players pretty much from screams at the game place and it is a Cassiopeia hear the hover over for the volibearsystem fan favorite support Champion do the bar and some more engaged options as real Phelps and they're compromised gay biofrost rakan is Queen especially on the big stage one of the champion to use last time he was in his Champion into the record for the big are definitely going to have a lot of forms of initiation very very goodit's going to be about which those tools effectively which team can get control of mid lane as well to try and stop by and looking forward into this game there's a lot of help on the side of much gaming and the targets for Kiana to actually assassinate are pretty slim especially with house Dave Cody son plays in the mid-to-late game so I think it's going to be a very difficult one of the things that happens when you first picks at Champion I think clutch has been very cognizant of the competition they put together so they don't get punished by Keon you put that one together XIV champion of the split for Damonte Renekton coming in as a counterfeit keep prepared for the Keanu first pick a side of a draft face if that's okay no problemwatch this one so far in summer hoping they can take a third-place you're themselves do I have a quick pause on screen how can I screen right there first time he's been this stage of this pic yeah a lot of the Equator super excited to be on the stage in Detroit has been an amazing crowd so far early on in the fan. Outside we had so many clutch and CLG fast show up to a lot of the food they were going to have a little bit of a Popeye's right before getting into the game but I also like how there's more that goes with this game one than just the start of the series kind of the rights to Kiana have been thrown down here clutch you know that they are very willing to pick this Champion even on blue side and they've thrown dancing OKC LG if you can win with Keanu then they're going to have full control of this pivotal Champion for all of champ select yeah I completely agree and calling back to when p o e did play it it was in that game 3 against Cloud 9 of the semi-finals you only game that she owed you was able to win but it wasn't your typical key on a victory it wasn't winning Lane with gang cast list and then snowball to decide Lanes in when he quickly it was a come-from-behind victory with some very clutch length am I picking out a very reliable way to win with Dianna more like okay. Serviceable with the champion which does kind of calling to question I think validate the gamble the clutch is taking on his Kiana so Jacoby point this is kind of the game to prove whether or not to watch active and it going forward or if this is just purely icog champ select bird I will see what happens right here it is good to see it in game 1 and if she continues to perform here in the summer split third place on the wine for the first opponent you're the regional qualifier for World in two weeks time did Lena squaring off both with oversized to Hoops for weapons. Amante also and accurately size hula hoop by the way that is the correct proportion for a hula hoop they are big full rotation without it we got a really interesting discussion for both of these teams throughout the summer split by the way if you have been very focused on objective but fairly different objectives different size is a mess where the best teams at controlling the dragon side of the map on the lower half of the map Clutch Gaming one of the best actually the best at controlling the rift Herald top side of the map as far as if we are going to have split cancer as they start off on Red Bus for both Tumblr and also thinking about the jungle matchup weekly was held down fairly substantially by Spence care in the semifinals and had a very austere he's looking at the Champions that they're playing in this game lyrics going to be heavily focused on getting up to level 6 where he can then start making plays around that Rift Herald we just talked about putting your the game I wonder where Wiggly's going to look because he will want to pull off some successful game General ecog is a plot for top Focus team depending on the game and rarely pho mid if they have picked a composition what do Focus around mid with the Grog astatke on it so again playing a little bit off of their Norm with these pics and the stuff you look a little bit further into the game is garage sales to get a good Fighter game Ponte Vedra made or towards the bottom half of the map be honest so good at using the ultimate you opposed to level 6 in the dragon fight scene Get to blow up basically in a float on water as well as they say they're so horrible fight 10 towards that half of the map waiting and seeing at the phrase come forward perfect CS allow for the month to hear 999 the first three ways practice that one at home with a good start so far in his Lenny face for sure if he was going to lose some of this one is like watching mid laners play Renekton because I feel like sometimes pilot him a little bit differently than top laners do what you much more they'll focus and you'll charge of his right to Fair bit but here is that talks about 1 to get that killed their going to have him power it's done already burned what they read it again by the fruit water version crappie teams that was just answered the five-man midday 3 minutes and 30 second in a little bit of a strange-looking Chase towards the river or power people Ripple hit the water blades to actually lowering his damn it for the CC and then for ruin flash flood one side of the word execute us to get to the other side it still dies also giving up the Summoner spells I'd like to if you look at the top wave right now away from him so you can never get away from Kiana by running to the river because it's full of water element if you see their power of evil able to get it weekly Flash sometimes when players come onto a bigger stage for the first time they end up playing more passively. What is happening here although I think there could definitely be some Jitters at work here the fact that the retreat towards his turret when he had slice Dice and Flash up but instead Retreat it down for the fact that ruined then sloppily died in the top River with his flash being burned at the very end I think it'll take a little bit of time for these guys to settle in early on everything is showing up clutch yeah that's way in the mid lane was definitely steals the advantage at the beginning and yet because they have to lead or teleport they are not quite as coordinated in the Roundup it is Clutch Gaming with the early lead in this game and I want to call the attention towards topside Kobe wear after we saw a ruined die the way was in a really bad spot it actually got froze in front of her knee skirt for about two or three way so you can see now 35cs 217 guti Haz a level up in it as well as three charges of that corrupting potion so we'll be able to pick up some of that cs-12 crashes against his terrific uni definitely in a powerful position right now in Atlanta and Stampy and still act this is one of the Holy Trinity of Huna Champion a hard carry games on the Gangplank has definitely been one that gets perform very well on the RTC weekly coming up to the top side trying to allow her ruin some extra control here with a minion wave well-positioned now in front
