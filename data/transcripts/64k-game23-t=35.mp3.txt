tournament and it's a building hide it is Building height again underdogs absolutely sooning are one and seven against hockey the fort in the LTL all year long. One game was back in week 5 of the spring split it's been a lot of wins in a row for many peoples trim its side and top-view sports the question remains which of these teams will try the third strike LPL world champion expecting a torn been on the side of spooning one of the big differences between these two teams is the Top Lane and it was very big in the last matchup that they did have in the semifinals plays Carrie's game since he had an orange came that they actually played it and that was one or an in a sea of Carrie Top Lane Champion for them they have been to every single game of the World Championship thus far and I've got one then left to do it or will they break their patternwill it be 12:00 3 + 9 makes it is it going to be sore or Ben or someone else betting a sin away and going off with this one I mean you're seeing through Graves Kindred mentally are the three biggest Wranglers at world so far Lilia has not been played by car salt long World included as though so gin made me to take away from love is taking away one of the best pic bed soon and have found success without this isn't to say that the only area that they have obviously his Misfortune bottom line was also extremely strong but again your point on the jungle pinching here is very big with also First Take not being used by tati for to try and take away the other comfortable Champion that cars that has shown he is gone to the lease in after the grave the Middle East has been taken awayand they are going to get a feel of their own so both team opening up this pic fan attacking the other team's comfortable Champions here and he's very interesting I want to thank him again for one song is the likely bot Lane and what they thought it was interesting that is recent shooting pics and banned throughout world they could replace standard to on twos every single as real game they've played it a long engagement every time he has played Aspen alongside Lulu the gym taken away the headphone Duo pics there was well we'll see if I do come through overall instantly set gift grab and bring to see the pic now for maybe night has been the most flexible mid laner that we've had at World's End he could play this at Oriana didn't do so good to be extremely likely as when you're facing and Oriana now on the side of tuning either want to go with an assassin to try and attack her close range or outrank it was doey I think that Zoe has beenAngel one of angels best Champion to ride up there with the syndra probably even be best to try and grab something for him before the second round of band come in Oriana really excelled in the Midfield that mid-range getting a couple of extra levels into the W so you can clear that way he doesn't go with the Zoe as they're also has the extra range so he could do a similar thing to know the second round of the bands coming through a to go to pick his sixth unique champion of Worlds night had played nine across 11 games and not there is no Yona that again was played every single time alongside the Ezreal set with next in line behind that one for that one was early taken away likely going to you and Jeff down the bottom side and not going to be really high priority for them then because sooning as we said before are primarily pretty much always play carries for bin and it will need somebody to engage for them sort out is be engagedare for the team has come of talking about he's also one of these big shock collars cause those engages later on into the game credits I would say though yet not unless these other hard engage support Scooby what TSR trying to Target here deny them from Sword Art and I'm expecting to see the support grab pretty early from TuneIn top Esports more than any other team in quarter-final onward 40% counterfeit rate and he's in the west side is that Red Sox to guarantee I'll roll guitar what been terrific is going to be part of gays here is locked and they get to work on or sort out one of the biggest play making shape it's in the game I love its combination with leasing as well he can actually sing cupsoh well with at the lab and they both have the gases you can play some really interesting Vision games by hopping over walls and allowing your teammates and then hop to you but it's a very quick double-locking hear Pantheon or very aggressive play on their own side to with the point-and-click sun and the dates very very powerful later for the topside difficult to go with a canopy chair for been up since they're Camille is band out that one of the ones we're usually try and get a hectic ultimatum set him up for cancer killed the Wukong exactly what they use in the semifinals yeah into its weight in the reverse match up and that was actually the best game of that semi final four or soon and we're then was able to get a council kill in the TV one rose will be the first this time. Was 3 6 9 on the Jason the reason you always get that Wukong very often to the types of these dudes extra armor and regeneration from his passive do you trying to stack up and then look for your all in opportunitythe Jade try and get the kill and that's going to require jungle attention all I will say though we work on getting the stack armor via his passive and probably early didn't happy as well he's got a set jungle just I'm really physical as well so it's similar damage typing typing you've got an armor stacking top 100 natively that's going to look pretty good for been over all is that set up against 369 that is going to be a tough matchup if you're going to play My Player you're really going to ETS favorite almost down the line but if you step on the day and you do about what needs to be done then you're great and I do want to interject on this in the semi-finals this wasn't such a catastrophic matchup for spooning because of the emphasis that top put on 2369 Renekton devastating counterpick in the favor of 369 plus they sent karsa to gank his Lane early for him getting him first kills in both of those games do itjungle attention resources it is graphic resources so much that copies for trying to funnel into 369 to get that winning top side by funnel 369 in the early games 369 in the late game is a player of the absolutely playthrough is Harold 1.27 a game that they play around topside is that dragons for it by the way they have a very low person I can percent at 15 minutes on average they are playing around top five in the early games and you got this matchup we'll see how much carsick can be up there but on the other side was going to happen for sooning around the bottom side we saw how well one song played in the quarter file his Djinn from inside the base get a champ. Still in the way he's still outstanding there dragon controls excellent soothing playing around the bottom side most likely we'll see how it shapes up though because you got a bowl tonight up topside regardless and we can figure out which team can play around ityeah and we should start off this game by painting the entire picture from those semifinals because while there was you know counter pick topside lots of gangster up early on to the topside which resulted in a big c s leave for 369 there also was a big CS lead for Jackie love and you Yonder in that series and it was mostly self weren't in various matchups for them into Hong Fang and sore. And that's where the components that people are expecting to change because at World bong bong and sword art have really stepped it up this has to be one of the differences for sooning to make sure they don't get a similar result as they did in the LPL a lot of phase one side lot of conqueror on the others going to help him do just not in this match of course already won upset win with the quarterfinals going on at the wife am I like this trying to play on the Debby's much as possible to get off it never gets it going he's going to be just fine overall in Sleepless blue on one side laceless red on the other foot.path that will get them at toppling around 3 minutes 10 seconds level 3 double bass ready to go ready to rumble full match of around 3. I'll talk to you look like you're so far for the music. Especially with the chase because for Chase Another One Bites the Dust year for Jaso especially with with hitting this yet you also need to try and find that harassment for Leon to the Wukong pushing up the Cs there you get access to the brush Advantage then you can get off your cues get off your auto tax on the Wukong dropped into the breast to drop to Agra from those minions so you can drop off some of that extra damage back in China whittled down that Wukong early on to open it up as an area for your jugular try and take advantage of and you meant to the starts for both junglers Huron play making jungle champions for the early game both of them starting their routes on the bottom side clearing up towards top and you can see there's already a defensive War here from 360in the jungle to see if sofm tries to make his way there wait to see the match up those come out to being much right now bottom is being pushed in on the top Esports I'd not going to do anything cuz no one goes around was just nine Farm underneath the turret in very heavy clear for us while I'm going to leave early but the crowds most likely I should say Carson making his first award and still 16 but I think his entire left side and it took control and that's what time is very efficient really really high goal difference for jungles at World's End it. Was the same in the semi-finals as well you know there was a 30 c s Lee at 1.4 sofm even got a solo kill on the 369 but Carson did so much more for his plane actually getting those gains off and he is on the set that definitely relies on that play making so we're looking at Pantheon Lane you can definitely try and play out their point and click into the set and Gage provide oh my gosh play making when you add a gin on top of that even with a flat it's easy to try and take down that killed because you get your W-2 route from your gin after the flat and you're able to secure a long song of course does have cleansed but he's aware of the possibilities of the CC stacking bottom land that is looking for kill pressure and Ice-T board comes down from Sword Art what's the middle Brushwood can track them the link and can move and we prefer dad likes to knock out the 2 on 2 fact that go good dammit Jackie love more or less lose that Fred but he's got reason you went for the boots multiple potions situation he can step away from some Avicii Odyssey plenty of region not a problem down there and buy weed in job make sure they know that both Emma's back down to decide then they took all six camps then then went back for the second response and speaking of potions I got to keep track of the Wukong potions as we're talking about the dates trying to constantly Whittle down this Wukong the 9ps under the turret had to bring the potion really early on does have biscuits who's got the arrival there any train this pain under the tower but this is a match up where we can just tries to scavenge through yet and and try and save life until you get your level six point that's why the Wukong is picking TJ's you will come down there with your passive armor and and regeneration within Wukong at level 6 we conquer you have tremendous all in Kill pressure on the Jace and this is where 360 I'm thinking of very intelligent recall right now to go back because that's where jungle pressure starts to look towards the top side from the Wukong player sfm suspend power clearing head down this entire beginning of waiting for him to get level 6 to have that possibility and he's 4 seconds later on the recall basically split equally by the Cool Breeze 369 and and that means honestly so far so good doing better than last time they met and I want an ounce as time to Ford we are 2 minutes of the rift Herald spawn the Drake is already alive right now at the S having pressure in the Box side it's usually pretty easy to drink and kind of guarantee that nothing is an Iowa sneak breast with them but if you go based on projector. History at some point he's going to grab this for a stray cat going to go ahead and grab that first held well already looking into the river for car sub looking to try and preempt that play from sooning he has been keeping up in farming with the leasing as well for asset which is very good number sense sofm it's been our farming away on the lease in he will get the crab the carson-speaks around to get that deep Ward and Jake have teleport a good pick up there and is it to grab the Scuttle rate in time cars anyway and you may be known the timing is to offer assuming they had to push in the wave Andre, I love the flavor top Esports they shoved in bottling what's the problem in finding us back to recall big playing the topside been forces the flash away from 369 but hey that's okay you can go and get my ass out no big deal we got Drake here on CSI and it's actually even better than okay for the confidence to get that has flashes traded because you're cool down for your ultimate comes up much quicker and you can repeat for the threat of those kills dragon. Going over to BS as you mentioned good Advantage there for a while because of the backing of the bottom Lane and we'll see if they can actually make something with the extra Global Ciara panteon about to hit Level 640 on use one of those players on TS that would take advantage up most heavily in their series vs fnatic and this was an area that people are trying to think I'll maybe soon and will to repeat that success that fanatic have you know maybe there was
