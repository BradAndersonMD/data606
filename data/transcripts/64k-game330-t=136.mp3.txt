never seems like he's gotten back to his old self a sort of Philly dominant self with an optic gaming was so good before and I don't even really seen that version of him in quite a while but hopefully this would be the time things turn around optic gaming by the way Acadian back in the Rockford Morton has been the host back in he played to order games back and I believe one hole or two in three Flames more orange more loving door there in the top line for optic obviously bring a rotating intake and Auckland now olurum is up there as well I still have yet to settle on a kind of Wichita player is going to work best and maybe they will continue to rotate through them but no dhokla hasn't had the most success early in the LPS I still really looking to prove himselfcoffee table so far off the gaming pretty standard considered Okie pixie could do the Raton band going to remove one of the final option for p o e a very very strong game right now and once I do band Pink I'm Nocturne early pick your cuz mean in a number of things go to sleep easily jump in the bottom line is incredibly versatile and I think that is one of the strengths of it as an early pick up a child can be able to grab it first then I'm going to keep your options open a bit cuz I'm not expecting double at the player though likely to be in the mid lane a four-fold out there or jungle person have to talk to that one right here off the gaming taking their time in the incredibly annoying but lots of other options there as well for the successfully rising and prioritiessplit almost always play as Fort and pretty folk everybody knowing that regard in France today cuz your flag on his house we haven't seen it yet from Optical we have been seeing a lot of that today and it is going to be the bottom Landon and now I think is it going to be a good test for liquid right because we saw them fall short against Heimerdinger get spliced fully prepared for that they didn't really notice early what the play into it how to play around it this is kind of a good barometer for that did you learn something from those referrals games what will your pics be into it are you going to bring out something like a stipper or you going to go for it all in line or really what is the option and how well can you excuse us first non market and pick in the bottom Lane to optic have been happy to stick with funnel a lot of the time dimpling standard ball in the whole way through with arrow in big playing together to new look here at the top or support for the conflict big br40if it is available I'm going to see if they want to pick one for double before this and that's a champion has to be picked up in the Top Lane impact on mood has been shunned support 99% of the time they send the bot Lane is going to be held here for CDL prep want to see what the rest of the graph is going to cut shapes out into this kind of bushes off ticket the draft for aggressive top laner and because dhokla has not been a guy to really play that I can kind of make it a little bit it's called Moodle masses of the very well into Orangeburg Deadpool with his Auto Plaza actually played this season I'm even looking at alarm he has to earn games before the six games have been or the other two were Mundo for off it right now if you're going to just say okay well I guess I play Warren into Mundo well that's a very good for your factious it happened to match up and not honestly in the draft like this kind of praying on the champions tour some of the weaknessesit really does kind of have in draft and then why was the akkadian going back to his sort of more natural style as well he had threesome jail games but now on graves he was going to be more assertive for morning to damage early pressure I can get move not to be funneling with this Champion we can still run Smite until funnel but sorry this game we are expecting a wacky Lago Vista 400 thieves a true problem putting by was the one getting funneled there going to be a raise also just bring a consistent physical damage source is going to be nice when you already have two magic damage dealers on the table against of shen and a moon do you want to be able to diversify there a little bit before some more difficult choicesgalio be taken away and think so anyway the galio a tells me they think it is going to be the jungle and kind of taking away Galley was an option for Beltre have any way Kaiser from doublelist at work is most preferred Marksman in that bottom Lane and waiting to see her as an answer to 2 - are cuz that is something that I feel is quite effective against it but we have not yet really seen it pop up here oh maybe double spring off this time around I think it's interesting with the way they've done their band pics before it is fully until the agenda lorm it's so far away that gallon of Eastwick me to Atlantic right here so how to make the blind read expecting it to me to go to the vet and now it's time to make their fix for their last couple of things have to change a little bit more pobelter though right like he has been playing mostly irelia for irelia games you bought it out of her problems as well yeah and it has been quite a bit so you're taking thoseon the irelia you do have to find you another middling Pixies comfortable and he has played the galio and he also the other two games but going to be something new and Jarvan top the lock in here for dhokla I don't definitely know that much for some money but it's got to be something to watch for SSI preferential early on I would say to the Jarvan but she doesn't have the best scaling and it certainly me to answer to take over later using that kind of freaked it passes over from Jarvan kind of people out with your cue and if you want to build aggressively into something like a lot of driving like to go on Titanic rush but they can't what's an executioner people often do grad do 10 dual up fairly well against that Mundo AO plays it safely you can get in the farm get the items that are really do try to become more effective jungle anyway it looks like I'm probably going to still move Lagoon can also be a thing it's in the day has no hard I don't know what that might be a big brain right here lots of wrinkles in it found it out either way it's going to be facing up against one as we've got a new look here is power of evil playing at Shiva 14th known for quite a bit not to be so fun looking at it certainly is but it isn't very interesting haven't really seen Jen as kind of the funnel her like that to support in that midline is going to leave in Alistar wrong at Eric Champions like this what you actually does that percentage be so it actually is pretty effective at killing big monsters in the jungle early on so you can help there as far as thing out that Gemma for you to Leah but it will be that Graves for Acadian midi is going to be piloting the support Shannon Hensley in the Middle Lane to really fun a lot of others to leave for pobelter in a triple tank to threats to Leah and the Djinn who are not the most assists in a few Fighters as far as easy to help with MI5 so yeah we'll see how effective they hit really hard to get me wrong but absolutely this can be unreliable stuff to watch for their the skill sets the damage does Paul off optic gaming play something a little more Sanam actually I do stuff you we did switch over to Smite Achilles injury is to be so fun at least a little bit no occasion is on the grave. Jiren is going top will be at home and watch forastero play his first non marshman any any LCS summer split and we are into the game this is very interesting so can I haven't seen Smite Sandra and send it to me if you like someone who's pretty vulnerable if you're actually nope invading your phone in the jungle and I think the way you can like Raptors if they are available what do big things here I think he might be taking Smite I have lead to spike Cannon to Smite the cannon to push away the lot faster and then if you have is Polly a shed combo in the jungle farming the wave is going to crash a lot faster going to lose more minions more experience and I perhaps really not get as much out of it as they would want because messenger is not like at Allen and isn't someone as flexible to move around the map solo again this is just a prediction have not actually see the mites in your bed yet to get through to him or 1/2 and not quite number 3 do you say yes I'm going to get your ass up in that wolfcamp though I believe he cast them while still under Home Guard with the celebrity was giving him a bunch of ability power and he can revive those later on T3 call for some help in some Manner and he can pretty easily kill the wolf Camp by himself or the very very minor leash and have an XP lie to me in a link I think he's actually leaving for power of evil while going bottom line it is this is what I'm I'm thinking he's going to do is actually come over wake up these turrets power of evil starts with Smite I think power of evil is going to be the one to take the experience here a while the timer is it kind of providing this big lead with that Crow storm and the triplets Harrison really clever stuff but I love it I think this is pretty cool unfortunately big did take one little wolf so not hitting straight level to power of evil I will be getting that level 2 right now he's fine ghost gets up I mean I like to see the creativity gas is almost as much fun as they can get a course and even for you you can just kill that 390 damn it, but he's going to go pretty aggressively grabs his own read immediately get bi-fold and blue and no one is near him is going to be taken away because power of evil is faster to level two of our people is going to be kind of contestas wave a little bit better than he otherwise would be able to in this is giving grades bit of free time to steal away some of these pants then we'll see if he's actually cut out because he doesn't know if they're going to Scuttle or straight to blue and then kind of stuffing out where he might be so he wants to take us to stay for a few options they have spotted at Blue is gone even though they look so we were spectator fully respect the discretion better part of valor like if they're coming up first blood in a free red and blue so I think it's definitely the smart play there he could have rested and maybe got an additional snap but risk vs reward is not very good there for them self very far behind if it goes badly was going to go down to the dragon side take away a Scuttle of his own and then he's still going to have that one campus take Tollway and I have an additional Camp kind of on his side of the map to clear because of that so pretty interesting stuff so far from the two teams some new strategies coming out in the new counter responses and you can see I think he actually I heard another track him down so era did go for the E in two tastic huge ass for that part of the day cuz I can watch that if you want to see some more Hiram mechanic but the extra beam-out get the bunch of damage and he's pushing double effect boots for pot if you remember back stubbly baladi days like where was Miss Djinn Ash verisk everyone started going okay originally is doran's blade while I get poked too much okay now it's a long story but now it's food for thought of this is really something that you can do as an answer for the super Super Pho Katy Lane you have to stay around it and sustain long enough to get a preferential because those four posts and stain you so much more in the time that you're in lane then the lifesteal would doran's blade or ordering Shield really could point out the fact that more sustain on this Jen and I think they are similar issue in power I think in a general case that he loves lace is a generic surplus funds were ruined but if you need to play Lenny face and not die out Brighton Landing Faithfully to Oracle when you more games maybe in this matchup but I think it's a fairly intelligent words by deadlift to consider that as long as he's doing it here. Surprised by Hayley Paige distinction couple shots come through most that was Josh by only eating double oven not a minion on the top 10 even though with that for hot start no potions for stun their opponents you know they are getting poked out he is out of health potions completely and he got very heavily into the lifestyle he actually has Legend bloodline as well as over he'll also so really getting all of the lifesteal South Barron. Go shopping get rid of any of them. back to its heard him and maybe got out without the flash hard to say though and he was trying to dodge any potential flag and drag or end of the line coming out there from Grey's to come project essential skills. Side away optic get a Summoner on the flash and they do force of the TP here as well go plus should be able to hold his hand it was actually that they didn't decide actually commit for the flag drag flash because of dhokla hit that knocked up maybe they can actually them flash following get the kill but these are in a hard calls to make and don't actually committing for the TV I think to try to be right back of this one is afraid of Hills first blood do to liquid but that is kind of a killing we seen actually Thalia gently Alta resources combos place in the bottom line I haven't been to get as its final but you set up the SPCA guarantees the fling out of that and that is the burst damage I came out there
