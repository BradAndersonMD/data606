talk about it that oh why is he died from flyquest and by the time we saw Caitlin polar bear and fresh that is just really good League of Legends champion and they had to call their shot weight rent an office as well for anti dive sucks to be galio yeah I think more credit should be given to the side of flyquest for good drafting on blue side in blue 545 there in answering immediately once they saw galio there like I could we get the anti. We have the teeth after pics Wayne + Shay for extra anti dive and then they don't care what the last Vikram easy would be so really well done by flyquest from blue side now they're on the right side where they get to save a counter fixed and I'm excited to see you at what they can pull out generally I have liked solo actually getting the counter pick because tired of you both had so many blind pick options45 Anza in peace still is always able to perform on your stuff sort of high damage a secret from him and taking out a couple of the priority pics and obviously very closely associated with him for the entire year they throw the Caitlin been in there as well so he grabbed set across all right now grapes and Caitlin van across the LCS and LDL as those who remain fairly high priority why Quest grab the set is in there we'll see if I'm going to go ahead and take this crazy something else as well but like Westgate now two games in a row has the highest priority 80 Careybadass here and especially if you have wild turtle while turtle is accuracy with global ultimate has been a strong point for his whole career and this man has had one of the longest League of Legends careers as players play we do get the trifecta. This is a very common Champion pick guess it Diane work on were designed for each other but they really really good but supplemental Champion that's very often pick with Doric on because set flanks that ultimate AOE grouping works so well with the speed of work on its it's a very very easy to AOE CC lock them for big Zaya play collarscan be for me to watch for their yeah I like stop a lot to be a lot of damage bank is going to be on his Bruce's buy a pic of the split finally off of Elias off of Israel for this one now instead flyquest in the first game and was going to be left on the table here with you have a bank and do alongside Basil Ford furqan got to go bus over recent history as well we'll see if that can look good for him and now we wait around next little bit as the second phase to fix Advance come through flyquest not convinced that will be a top of the Gangplank and Corky again out on the Evil Genius yep trying to take away a few of the POV scaling Champion with mordekaiser top already and a volibear jungle they are going to have you no decency top sites to already top 5 mandation for honey good look pretty focused on Magic resistantdon't you think about things around mordekaiser though it's an interesting thing was a Kaiser that early then you have to start worrying about you know you don't really want to pick Champions that are reliable atan synergies as he can break so easily you also don't want to get yourself into a place where you need to get dragon's feels cuz mordekaiser just easily denies those by ultimate jungle I'm so genuine want to have more Dragon priority for your focus there as well so I'm looking at so that you dated for bad matchups for mordekaiser and one that sticks out to me is a colleague of your as well and Jack's in the one on one player who wants to play those kinds of Maple Theater come through the grass comes in as well at auction. Maybe a couple months ago bigger a PE ratios on some of his spells and I mean I've seentell me this is at midlane gragas please please please I really want to see a full AP gragas Wide Shut how do you sleep when it when it was the norm people hated it but it's been so long since we got each other really well played gragas combo one shot of obviously it could very easily be support and this is definitely something that ignore would play so I I'm kind of edging more towards it is support for I guess you know for the for the body plan for the inner up there also ultimate proof good at that disruption of the 80 bus that were made to it I I really would hope for its has our like 2% though because baby mullet support fragments down there but we'll see what Graphics going to be what's going to come alongside the composition of right now is the pic into a zeroset the drawer was Nerf in 10.16 20 leskiw damage at Max rank is definitely pretty medieval base damage hit so still staying in all this is a really important not to fit into his ear by the way not favoured into mordekaiser lose a lot of things that match with pacifically another one where game long has not favored he was also true into shed his back but as a game state record does not typically like going against that champion right. Not great Hector may be isolated to can't be the front lines can also be problematic here but you want to see what happens I still like cockroach baby not as much with these matchups yeah and I think I've done a good job of stacking their answers for the reckon since is our kind of shone so early you know they pick up the syndra always like that as a midline option in to work on later on your scout of the week is so good versus the Recon and Recon really does have to get a kind of fed toto have the answers to have the money to make things like Sonia's and stuff to do immune Center Olsen and avoid getting on your birthday and it puts more pressure on the rakan using control words using Vision to find really good flanks and more surprised positions the crisis is such a good answer always love to see it with your body slam in the flash place that you can pull out I want to take a step back and look at season 20 20 because I think my favorite change of the season was the support of changes were you buy it to your one and you can buy it real item from there so you can actually play the elevation gain is an upgraded to face them out and whatever else it's the season where you can more easily get to Azure stopwatch or whatever else he'll agree with you that it is hard to be work on in the world with mordekaiser insyndra trying to kill you instantly gragas down and support role who's going to make it difficult as well so excited to see how he is going to play out to be a lot of fun here as flyquest bring out some more chance if you don't see very oftenokay I see no sweepers for anybody so probably I know no weird stuff with the delayed invades or anyting should be defensive Wards trying to cut off both of the they speak in our body slam over-the-top he gets the ward and he slips in behind the Red Bluff you can go right behind Azle you want a bait and you show in the river for Azazel and then you both got the same time are the girls going to push him in case we going to run right into this Champion knocked up son could buy at night is on anyway what a absolutely beautiful level one game plan from flyquest Gloria stuff right there. He has $400 gold and those are always the types of things that that ignore likes to go for it to you know even even if he's a recording he'll like wopraying on defensive opening because so many teams that the same defensive screening opening just watching the entrances from the river broadcast has not been picked in quite a long time as a support I date guys able to get just over the back of the Dragon pit making sure of course you want to go over the upper kind of part of the back of the Dragon pit so that the person inside Rush can't see you ignore did just that and we saw all how it went down perfect timing on the pincer he doesn't show until he's in range for the body slam and that is critical because it gives enough time for same pouring to get there with the volibear stunt followed up and have just enough damage with a night to take him down even going over the wall and if you don't start right there for a little bit easier as a few difficult ruin on ash down there so it's going to be nice next rigali and a half and Lady face really hot shots expected as well going to track out what's been Stearns doing in the jungle they'll see your RedditDawnville see he's doing red to Bluetooth from the jugular playing against Ash it's great I love it the Drone is over my head giving away all information to my opponents Alex and Torrence and know that he can go for another drink or just passed around through mid try and get some D provisioned about that right now against Ash like like at this point in time go to Blue was dead and he was against 313 great flash by still look at some of the stunts but there's still a summer to spell down all right top pressure they're still finds its marked and against the most common top later right there oreimo comes outbottom side should be that Horan area to play I think he should be well aware though that the map is flip a trade Scuttle crab so they's One Bank able to flip their way out no problem and not a big deal right there go to the first shove in 29 CF pretty good only drops to on the first five West on the backside here even though you have if your opponent mid laners put stuff like that you're as your guest the shelf on to send you as much as your super sneaky there if you've been able to get behind them in the brush unaware there's nothing you can do because you're so far away you lose that to be to you have to run for the hills and it goes have a recall since Karen take the early very small i c s Lee finished up his Raptors is a little bit delayed on the recall though so since worn with the early upgrade into Smite here so he will be able to have a little bit better Chase Burns through his manifold air gets a deep Ward and sees the crugs respawn top sites and we'll know about to the Jungle pathing down the line from santore both involve for Top Lane Farm pretty close between the two will be so is punished for Flash being down otherwise with the gang set men ultimately nothing not going to change the ones you want all that much and who he actually going for a sophomore defensive abilities is not Building compared to the cry for she's going early specters Powell to be tanky against the law in a notch up and we'll see where it goes from there and I got to talk about in champ select since they have no volibear does a decent of a bee damage an 18 did to the whole top side of the map is a p so fast and furious this is super easy for me to buy straight from just seeing those early for 3 pick was Kyle but Catholic part of beige and part of threads and I'll do the rest later on right now send Troy walking up right through control we're going to go knock that one down still open the door for the trade is it comes up behind him who do will be back in score stood for the TV back to land solo did the same with his arm guard so he's actually got kind of the item that he wants for his match up receipts that doesn't do magic damage either so very efficient for his side of an app I'm really curious to see how this ends replace out to some already harveyville is struggling and this is 1016 where the extra syndrome Nerf did also come in you know you have your max rank on your darksphere really huge takes 20 damage off that thing and Arville not his game to go back to it but already struggling a little bit early with this year and I wish I could see the rooms from it as a one-v-one fight here in the death row from solo who needs down to four already feels about that one of them starts back in the office and they're coming one level ahead so might you got that one that you're going to ignore this Waters around so I can get a couple of grew up in time ignore was there for the combo and flyquest start-off 3 + 0 distracted that they were like playing next it's for the Scuttle Crab race or something to get that body playing flash right in time they get the first flood I mean they get the extra extra two kills cuz they had already gotten up early for a sled with his body slam over the dragon this describes pick just making all the plays for sequestered another look at it the race up the river to join the Stella crab Harvey benignity can see they force Azazel out even though he had been there almost the same time and on your screen of course there's a recalling azir since Marvel is there and EG midliner not going to Rome up easy win for flyquest they are the exit numbers Advantage you may have gotten a little crab but we got the kills ya very very standard support room timings is the first recall at 6 in the bot Lane until after I've your BF Play Imma grab Food To Go Topless to you later and so they are both are but this route if you mention kiwi house going to do this time around he had to push first in mid right you was able to go and go to lose stuck in lane and that was the difference of those two cases of 380 syndra and with a bunch of extra ability power you just made up
