stop is old teams playoff push instead of old teams in playoff bushes CLG fans going to be rooting for who he hear GPS support as you mentioned if C9 drops CLG lost a guarantee top two and a spot in the semifinals of we've certainly is gas so if you play over here that's been playing it a lot because it's actually probably the most played that's far this split his ethnicity has Broad Ripple ban against frog in here in Phase 1 from Cloud 9 so I'm very clear who they think the biggest threat is on Golden Guardian at least in the pic a bit now they dropped all threeabsolutely fun and have a kind of Pick 4 at some point but he's mine on red guarantee that they can secure it into a good match if I wouldn't do C9 play so what are these frog in finding out your former Champion so much that maybe it's not going to be as good as romantic as you'd hoped we have no cars available at those two plays that would be another one for him and it does get down to just one play froggy Champions below that with frog and certainly does have a very big champion pool and I am guessing it is going top but we do not know that and neither does Cloud 9 you can only guess just now it's not better in this world that I want to point out forMidwest used to be a thing back in the day Shadow voice 914 this is post patch a call ebw is only invisibility that means you play a Morgana or a LeBlanc or any other you can punch her down early and it's part of the TF Band by the way deal works against invisibility so strong to keep a collie safe and we'll see if it's Misty we've been very good at summer split or licorice has been very good for in the last year-and-a-half on that champion I'll work on getting locked in will just be desire or conduit I was on cloud nine locking a very strong bottom Lane pumpkin is already available as an answer was that play pop bot doesn't really matter if you get to the lake if you want to be able to come off as the fourth is just honestly I think silly make them sent the wrong wayclear will be the job until I got to go for their jungle pick up is when he's already take off cables do is Silas is already had to Jungle Band party that's been scared now you can throw a couple more and try to push him down that priority list a little bit more people here Exile Easton Bragg is nothing more than one place so far this split and I think a lot of those are not really play much anymore with Sarah for example least I'm getting off the next pass will do that in the playoffs not here in this one doesn't make sense when Cloud 9 just like to play Yahtzee right and you you couldn't definitely play that in the table. One knock up with the recondo making a little bit more difficult if they were hoping to go for that combo is there no last days here so not going to be taking off the table so you know concerned about the iPod Touch possible Donuts on can't remember to Sonic and be going top so they are going to be focusing potential bot Lane pics leasing will also be taken off the table so still lots of options for spent here and MimosasNapa taken away rek'sai he has to pick Saint Louis did play Trouble game with you play hack ROM games are still things like Olaf so if there are options out there but he's definitely pushed pretty far down in priority compared to the day for I wouldn't be surprised that you can just see it's Carter I think skarner is quite strong though he hasn't been playing in a lot of a great champion and we're going to see how it comes through is BGSU to pick themselves a couple more chance as they need to see their stool lands because I just wanna is flexible we need a mid-layer at least and it popped or bot Lane and looks like a victory will be to have her and I want to point out that picture of course has been played in three roll out a way to see what I want ghost yasso Destiny kind of wire do my only concern you are so hoping I read said that you have counter picks and if you don't end up with those Connor Pickney don't know if we end up with stolen advantages then you know they don't know where that goes doesn't really matter right nowArmstrong Cable leaders of the akali detox likely to get locked in here as well so they have their souls Lane blocked in it and you will have to see where a golden Garden think the best thing I could see each or thought you find a drug store in the potential to push but it didn't get locked in much worse carry for Tristana top because if your son is pushing you can get punished so heavily you know that the third hit of that Q I can actually knock you out of your Rocket Jump if you timed that well she got that you have jumper lie every time he app so that I can make it really hard and Flash follows or Dove called so I will see how they actually want to play this out early game focus it feels like we're Cloud 9 though and then go round things out with Karma and here in that unlikely to beat well if you're if you're reckless Atlanta right there but in North America car has been almost exclusively a top laner here so I think this is the lineuptake last 25 Texas T for sure what it is but it says I believe the way the fiver being set up right there licorice going to get me a truck to get to give me a call e-mail a heavy Fieri aggressive T4 seen I the only way is that please Diana's only so good at that surrounds the more and more you got to make sure you know where the karma and Karma chasing via call East is really a map of karma goes in the Middle Lane here for this for the night of specifically to repeal here freely in bids and Victor in the bot Lane for FBI States able mid laner who can be pushing in the akali give you lame party There Delilah is also I do think that no kind of soap Lake Worth worth topside you have a very defensive bottomley with Tom kench he was Wayfair hear from you I went to get the mobile knives with the E so now they're going to be able to try to place table on the bot side while Hunter has the backup all the starving cuz he is going to need that fuel to push and play this Laneactively I certainly could be bondable if he's pushing in and it is going to be able to execute HR and hail of blades Denso this is early early power with those rooms and certainly if parts are on the Tristana make any misstep he could get his card and maybe really excited watching the toppling fight play out cuz there's so many potential knockups to ruin the Rocket Jump atrox has for finish out has two is going to be exciting Victor so they are just playing this basically like you play Sona tahm kench so it's actually going to be who he farming well happy I will be doing the harassment until he's fully stacked the filthy so this is really really interesting you know if you can get that really felt these then you start farming then you start really kind of going well in that regard but it will delay the hex core upgrade quite a bit and then you're with her isn't really super strong until you've actually upgraded your laser so we'll have to see if it's been maintained that same old Power will do just about anything draftdo the narrow forward on this game thanks guys in Arrow exciting game especially in the bottom line we have FBI ballena for Golden Guardians going against the deathly the person that he replaced and in this game I see it is one that he's trying to prove himself so from your perspective what is this game means FBI has a lot of respect for you worked with both of them and Academy and that's like all my experience with him I know you always going to have good things to say so this is kind of a good chance to prove himself a bit but he's kind of been trying to do that for the past few weeks anyways I think the gamers doublelift was like a really huge wake up call for him already so this is just kind of like the nice one for him that he gets to play against the person you miss we competed against for the spot and I'm sure like winning out the really good friend inside and out so how do you see the sling going this game not really sure how the land will go over all of it it's kind of been a back-and-forth one from scrims but I mean Victory likes it a lot the Champions but he has the exact same name as in which has been a funny meme for us internally pretty good results in scrubs in Adel Jason likes it is something we playing Academy for a bit too so when is killing award down there and they have to plan another trip little while cuz I thought I could be scary and he's going to go to Waze contact really cannot fight him so as long as you're lanes are pushing on you have that potential assistance of this is going to look good for them so they're fading know he's around there is not even going to bother checking because he knows the potential that's been has in this one do you want you guys like me song over the key with the word you put down to the river so since I get out of court even saw him clear the war that ever itself though that's yours that's the matchup that yours goodbye took the Wolves Away Spencer and can't steal those little bit brown stew to can't take it and we'll see if there's ever an answer for contracts taken the Western jungle over to that side of the map because right now he is no pushing Lanes contracts in ways you can see this guy actually posting frog in Hunter you know his kind of neutral or or back so he doesn't know where he would complete the three-box would be able to farm back quadrant of the map as well would you give me a huge lead and thankfully for contracts Spencer and isn't yet aware but if it's kind of your opponent is doing contracts is it actually going to face assuming that's been staring is there so you know certainly getting by far the worst end of this dark contract goes back to base and he will have to Camp Celeste to get back down there course answers going to try to give him a little space here he's rushed the rebs might try to have a better chance to Monday 1 and that's as far as clean pots using OK is Contra left right now by the way I can stir up so maybe get a chance in the bottom side who taking the bill of the damage that one as well as a few shots you got fence going to still on the bottom side takes to Scuttle and they don't know he's here this summer and there's no war just bought this one since her nose no working to brush to get a get a zombie wear this whole time so you can be whatever just got a flash away and Billy will regen backup of December to spell down both got for who he the pressure over the farm instead of going to back up that top side and try to take as he goes for another gangster on the bus side is reward with both owners being taken off who he so this is totally reasonable Choice especially early game Champion you want to be active only making things happen and not just kind of allowing a Jarvan to do trade Farm in Comfort but that being said no you did this opportunity still fighting back and forth to the constantly you got who he down 2233 and farm so it is of course a bit of a difficult match a very good at bullying malate Last Exit FBI keep from this backup an FBI will be at working pretty but these were that he's done a good job but honestly even talking to spell thieves thus far are we can't eat Azazel exactly playing coin this is like we talked about last game you know it means that there's not as much pressure to action consoling poking consulate getting that harassment down so if you think you're going to take the worse end of the trades you just pick up the coin gold it is very consistent and you will always have that strong income from it and you get a lot of spam. She quite a lot and put the distant Shields and poke down so it even if even can be in some cases the better Lane Valley item avocado Cloud 9 pushing right back down after the Scuttle crab do you spawn to heat up has to be careful almost knocked up against the world. Of time and years FBI's TV and we know that there's no naka left for Azazel so as to be safe down here Spencer and looking around two of these walls and you the timer and take down to them as don't record coming down to help track the opposing jungler he's really making sure that contract cannot get down to the bottom side yeah it's like very heavily around that you can see a lot of words in that area from Cloud 9 as well this is a bushing laying here I from Golden Guardian I think he's actually looking for a black dog and cat they pushed forward I though he might sound kind of where he is we don't actually have Vision on that right I'm right behind that wall screw the blast cone coming in right behind who he there who had no flashing they get that kill and it goes to Spence Karen so he has the first Blood now on an early-game jungler and this is very intelligent there's no way really for who he to escape you have hellblade you fly straight over the wall that landed knock up who he knows he's dead to rights he does have Spellbook so he was able to write back to Wayne but even so sincere and being very proactive in this early and caught it so quietly and warming up who is going to be going tank and is a head now and experience because all this time Karen has been spending trying to get pressure on the bus side he's just been cleared camps and gold between the jungle is within 100 overall game is actually ggs favored in income the extra money to who he prints by getting the upgraded support item he's sharing a lot of that vs gold and topside right pushing and you know this has not been busy whatsoever so if you're left alone and no contracts is is protecting you enough and getting you fish in it since Aaron is not ganging you the trick is constantly pushing it was not a lot of recourse to that for licorice unless it was going to make that a serious misstep there was constant question and you will miss some of the CS2 turret and Hunter will continue to extend that advantage of the early upgrade attack speed boots you have any additional moves but I think it actually quite important in this solo Lane and if you do get access to that sure actually pretty nice there to definitely really good stuff right there thanks girl another blue bathroom - contracts
