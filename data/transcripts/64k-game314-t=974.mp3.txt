some of the North American LCS for 2018 the winner is heading to World's End of play in Misty you can do it as a tax advance come through I am so excited for this Champion Select actually because file. Are once again this is the kind of been their recipe they start out with Jensen and blabber and can make adjustments depending on how well do individual player for forms and they already showed vs. Team Liquid that they don't have to keep us together they're willing to mix them up vs. steel do I specify that is too bad though it was Kindred band every single game that blobber was in when they started from CFM that remains Bruce Julian also followed up this the same way to start out before when facing Jensen and blabber Target that combination at those two players have become famous or in all the regions across the world have been very good but Cloud 9 are change thisReggie from the previous best of 5 in game 1 in semi-finals it was three jungle bands playing at Forrest Gregg down he's still got gragas still had a decent game this time Cloud 9 putting the pressure on Jensen irelia and a collie the most commonly played as fast as the midline are off the table this time at no Bronco available as well in Project the type of composition that they're going to run very very high chance of brig on a tank Missy on a tank and hauntzer on a tank if it's not GP GP has other than that it has always been on some sort of a playmaker Gallia also can't do that and then spend on one of those High DPS Auto attackers for the late game Bears is going to be that plus the song Lady face and of course we has been going to verus instead offind a little bit interesting guys had been much more frequent pick for him in the postseason is now she got twice the place on kaip does embarrassed but but you're not around there will be a tomcat for the keep him alive and see if they're going to keep going with us a very steady state has been being a great team fighter a leader Championship I really do like it specifically when they already showed early Camille Camille eyes are very very high potency for picking people are very long-range but she's super squishy if she commits to someone you tahm kench devour that person all the sudden Camille will usually find themselves in a bad spot if they're not paired with something like a zillion or something that's going to give them some sort of defensive but on the other side here by 9 let's go with is a sock yeah because I'm very glad the North American teams have increased their priority on this HR associate in the LPL beforehand and never really even dropped it down and across the road as well for stronglessons from the topside and licorice going to steal that one of her from from positive but he might have to say it in a fun what I really like this I think they're worth 0 pics or bands of a truck in the entire playoff bracket quarters semis finals third-place 0hx expand at all they can watch the LPL LMFAO the region of the shows back up in the regional qualifier got a very similar scenario where he's very big across Asia to see that we have seen or got mid as well I don't expect this from you tonight but the TV in 2 HRS fixed but still want to watch are both bikes pics eight thoughts and our God can be moved to either solo Lane but he talks probably a higher percentage there for the topside forgot definitely very versatile Galliano band does come out because Camille's already been picked up by cloud nine that is one of the best combinations in the game you have Camille guaranteed and gave and locking people in a an area forhow big are we stunt with a ride and you can see if I'm still engaged could run you think he's losing another support from his pool as tahm kench was pick Ramen Leona where band is going to play something else all right so yeah they're they're definitely willing down on a couple of the support roll pics here for is basil big playmaker 459 no coming in out of the academy League very early on in he was one to stick on the starting roster.switch down here probably spirits and now could definitely haven't seen a Oriana jungle as well might hold five friend not going to bring that on at Nell's Cafe CT time soon alright meanwhile though the big locking of the time earlier if they have three tanks and they've already got them here Tompkin forgot and Scion hear from the topside for Hunter repeatable engagements for the late game when you get a little bit of cooldown reduction and you rank up your ultimate gets almost a 30 seconds there you can just buy off Opie after altice to get those heart engagement respect your head absolutely and we're going to see what they were against here and Cassiopeia being covered and Jensen going to play Cassiopeia intothis one and that one also had a first level 100 the greatest of samples Cassiopeia kids safer in the mid lane also has the rain to bandage over or got which is very big for the mid lane but again jungle or presence means so much in this and if Cloud 9 are going to have blabber on his Camille which has been so aggressive on and has played around Midland Camille and Zach ertz with the longest range engagement for junglers and both of them perfectly built to Camp around the midline so this is going to be a very interesting matchup between Justin and fierce than both of those guys are extremely Star Hill mid laners was very high skill cap going to want to get them ahead this is not the first time he's brought out or got in the NLCS postseason I think back to older guy around 2015 where he took down Cloud 9I'm at be out in the sun if they got to Serena outside and that was exciting as well either way we are in the game what is best of aggressive player with that Camille but Zack still in the pool for Greg and the only real range Marksman on that TSM lineup is spent damage dealer here. More to play but a very exciting drop all the same yeah I mean we were projecting at least three tanks for TSM account forgot as a tank so they've got basically for it's going to be up to his bed to have that big damage percentage the analyst test mention he at world has had the highest damage percentage for a team in any single run of any beer at world yetWorld Cloud 9 final stage of the North American Gauntlet fight it out here Cloud 9 I've had such a miraculous run at the end of summer they want to make account here and convert speaking of damage they have damage from basically every role of addition we have on our hands here and look like a very one-sided game here because they have so many options for damaged and in the early game if you will win the scrimmage is across the map because guess I won't be able to group up with their with their big damage and it's not even just offered Evans office for diving as well you think eight. Can revive Camille can drop aggro Alice returns back to be Invincible they're pretty good it really press the advantage those guys going to be in because that is so far for this Cloud 9 composition I would expect a lot of focus on blabber and blabbers early route here you know either give him a strong pull on the Redbox take over boat. Krabs in the river Camille absolutely will destroy Zach even though Zack after you get some levels you know can have a good presence around mid lane with elastic slingshot early on Camille has a huge priority over him with the hook shot and she will be able to dictate this early game so it's not the Cloud 9 to use blabber and know his aggressive playstyle here trying to help him out early here we go though it is going to be the double pole on the Red Bluff kind of Edwards expected what is a very common second Camp to go to now yes but for Matt Damon do his life is that correct a negative and high HP and help them if she actually Slaughters those camps so we'll need to go sport at that red comes down with rats. It's funny because it has evolved to be Zach's favorite can't because the magic is that you mention that used to love going outside to do the rough as well as a profit the same I'm there because Chris is so valuable now and he actually destroyed them with his family this is definitely me to Route and it was very good War there by licorice make its way to the top side as well so Cloud9 get to be informed of the Jungle pathing of Greg to know his right side Jingles totally open and Weber can use that take whatever Camp Seawatch I expect him to get a lead in the early information different keep your head up. I want to see what he's able to take away from break us not to Simply both scuttled and we need to also look at it from tsm's perspective right they pick this back into the Camille knowing that they're going to need Vision to protect zacherle off whenever you have this scaling jungle difference you know that your laners are also going to have to have that in mind we're not going to have to play your lane accordingly nephew could see it in all those words in the river defensively 40 at them they know blabber is now going for the second schedule if he uses all his abilities on this guy then you can go for the in Gable ends coming up yes is why I'm going to be in front of truck attack you back for it but yet be available to know. I've been able to match in camps and great move there by Missy it's all about the support from your team when you're going for these jungle permit is Zach is able to steal that one away by blabber slips Into the Blue Book any fish yet before the wolves are finished he's got a mouse with while it seems pretty likely so as if it's still in the way he's got to sign the report from Mobly that's worth from refrigerator TSM for yesterday and he actually looks pretty Siri coming in today he said that the team Styx most of their problems coming from Oakland and I think now found their stride what I love to see was that he told his players guys if you don't have confidence trusted me because I'm confident in you back to you guys are you sure in words from Reaper do you don't have your own confidence just trust in me and he talked about them fish fixing some of the problems from Oakland we have already seen a difference in champ select right here sneaky right on the Kaiser so reliable late-game scale know doesn't have to play like a Quinn has to go to early leave play side Lanes to join you know get picked off then and won't be able to put out teamfight damage later on caixa definitely very capable of that well also be why the Champions that can infect which side lengths later on because of an ultimate is one of the reasons he played twins to my supposed to go to the play some Matt mobility in those Quinn games against Tia said it was something got to be pretty powerful throughout the season but also the other Champion that they got locked Kristen for was the twitch I looked it up in summer of 2018 which has not won a single game in any professional region only been played three times. Sorry we did see her lyrics to have an eventual Camp lead over his supposed to jump a very small a quite sizable Advantage for has been admitted on the bottom side so different size than you expect a truck CDL Lane Bowling there is kind of the same always be ahead of teleport though also dented actually gets one level four no kill shelters in the end have to blow their flashes Greek as well and fairly early stages in the game so I would expect blabber to try and play aggressively following this get them division right now while you force them off of the map and Zack you do in base right now you can see already the clown on Vision on top side is starting to creep in around that Red Bluff would expect them to make an offense to move up here by burnout taking over the Scuttle feeling very confident now as far as the classes have been blown junk down there you mention that teleport was brought on sneaky hear that TV is going to use them as both a tiers get back to Lena to still a Farley proof topside Define level six. I just mean just as I could be there by the city of nowhere to go first in the Midway for Pearson after all the shenanigans that we just saw with everyone blowing flashes in the conversion around Midland he actually use the teleport bottom it's something that you do need to be aware of her Cloud I can just
