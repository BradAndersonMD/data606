but with the first two wins out of the gate but just in the nick of time Team Liquid stand strong rely on the team play and they're able to pull it out veterans have to be able to extend the series and I'm so Keen to see what the annotations maybe in draft airport DSM will they first pick the Tom Kent away perhaps will they early Bantu GP they do that is my guess. What else do you have because that certainly look very good for in the series and Sam is likely going to force them to show us something new so contrasting the game through the band's only changed slightly TSM dropped they added the force as the Tariff on here that's the combat TSM ran when they are on blue side of will they dropped at Chase or the lysandra neither any game in the series has always beenliquid has always been lysandra and now it's up but now you can get a trade write you any smarter ban if you can grab right that's a great answer not only but also to the lysandra herself so I think that this is a pretty smart band from Seattle and we'll see how we can actually work his magic good roaming on its ya throughout spring split has been one of the big Champion Borg Erickson for TSM Champions on the side of Team Liquid as well go ahead this the first time in the draft that has been more successful overallscomes in for Smoothie as helpful answer and Leo will because I really can only threaten kind of those all in the training is very poor from the champion especially against who can get those stacks on you if you do go in by real question is still just like All Eyes On Top Lane they're going to Blind Pig there is Gillian Welch excuse me they're going to be here but they will likely save impact Pick 4 last and what that will be may very well kind of decide if it's made of his series I really like liquid I don't believe that he can do that again revived the team edge control was very good in the lane in a Cinderella he was up far but that was not about him that was about the team fighting and I think this is going to be more support towards doublelift to really is a starcall this team the guy you want to bump up the guy you want to protect him they're going to have a lot of different ways to shut down any potential to go to Broken Blade if he has a counterfeit ready for the zillion Rod those are also very big pics for me I would say it's pretty risky to send lesandro Top Line because I think that tank connector that incredibly well Alessandra is not someone who steals very well in the 1D One it's generally more about the early game and that's not really been the style that GSM has been kind of going for they have been playing very often stealing fix for Broken Blade where you can Farm up in that side lane and become a Monster yeah I really do like both of the options of the akali and of Vladimir for them that being said she will be able to save the last year on right sideone final band 40s time will it be in with a jungler yes kind of hecarim dropped off the table you do if your play top into a truck we know we can play jungle pretty successfully and it's one is removed also it has really good synergy I do like scar here though I think it works very well for them last time and also again you talking about Jamie that has synergies with speed he went Predator his glory dead man that is all about speed and billions are going to make that even more effective and as expected it will be the last pick for impact this is going to be the rest of the cam coming out here then as usual trying to get into Jensen's head would be quite a safe option but you can't do expect veristat the run that lane as far as pressure goes then back on Comfort he spends good at the champion and regret not saying it back in their series get up and it will be fixed now really intense me a picture of a colleague of course but can gain w02 in the series with that champion all right did I have obviously put a lot of practice a little bit of extra juice extra damage coming for a man but broken play it has also been so good on the akali that's why they're willing to Blind Pig at for him but I will say still they have that for online that have so much protection for double if so don't have to be as much pressure on impact in those team fights it can't be him actually zoning people out free space with the ultimate attack. This game is going to be so much about the duration of all these I'm in Windows akali shroud lesandro ultimate both also buy time also come through at least hit through shroud but this is going to be a very tight one here liquid have one one do more straight to get that trophy its three titles in a row something that only TSM has accomplished here in North America have to be champions of all gone the TSM already we'll see if York soon we'll get number 6 and his teammates can get there first and North America he's the only one to take that title so far LCS spring finals 2019 continue as a players load in game number 4 with a Terminus DSM takes it home right now or flick would bring us the game 5 last remarks from the coaches summoner's Rift the loading up the fans are ready so are we going to be damn sure the players are two TSM for Team Liquid best in the LCS never more hotly contested split so much on the line it feels like four players across both of these squads trying to prove themselves as New Rising player trying to prove themselves as a long-standing veterans in these leaves and it's going to be in so much about teams to win lyrics to get lyssandra until now they thought more was important in this draft we know he can be deadly on this Champion Tony play Styles available to him this one going to be these set up the rest of the squad and during spring split often times when we saw this was before TSN he was invading with a KTM flasher early you can see Brazilian record that there are four Jensen 9 and 1 his one lost to who else lyrics in Yelp all of that coming on cloud nine with their classic combination with their Kindred much less offensive oriented jungler this time around billion and Starner. Duo definitely not but if you're going to have to be terrified that Rex IQR impact you are now flashless potential to Rome up there from bjorksten Acadian certainly a very strong early game don't work here on the wrecks I in there going to have to be extremely careful about getting behind in that matchup against colleague was one of the best snowballing champions of the game I think I was been having to leash it does make the bottling push go easily Team Liquid the way they have control over how they want this one to play out expecting to get bottom schedule looks like without much as she was there actually went all the way down for the Crux of every Power clear start for Acadian Miss doublelift core JJ verus Tom can't do a last time do successful doublelift feeling much more confident now throws in a little taunt which events which is it up goes for the Ezreal pick way harder to punish them Nicholas stuff certainly one of the reasons you saw has been fall so far behind is because I shall reign for they looking for attention now afraid of what a double, with you he's got TP not cleanser barrier so could have been a kill straight up a little too and you know Rex size top side there's any is up yeah. Just have to wait for the claw as soon as this up he can Flash into started off the timer 3 Jensen nose look at his position in so far back the closet very slow-moving yeah takes the pole but Jensen far enough back minnechaug was fighting over control of this one little pushed away is Jensen moved over that way first and there's timer slowly take away but early some of the advantages here now for CSM in both of us olanes it will mean that these guys are going to have to play more carefully and no as in fact you want to be playing aggressively on the Canon you want to be in that guy's fade frocking or klepto trying to harass him down and you don't really have the option to do that without your Summoners it's too risky of a play and then once broke his leg gets to that level 6 very scary all in potential who seen him pull it off time and time again are there at least for now impact does have the farm lead people to queue from long-range to stay safe as well wait time it again Travis Lane does play out of 50 is topside I got no flash for the 10in can make it more difficult to pull off but in case there's a die if he's around and then out goes the recalls mottling actually slightly before his van got more to farm the same as I closed the game was the previous yeah sitting back on Ezreal see you safely and effectively just trying to find out the Mystic shots not going for a lot of Trades what's happening on Minion is best Champion I think so far this little first what are the Jets into I want to see this replay from the TSN Vision side because it looks like there was a moment of hesitation when they saw the starter coming down mid lane then still went for the flash hopefully we can see that in fog of War because it feels like it was a bit of an over commitment their team liquid get the funnest thank you observers here it is for the team until they both had perfect timing by the collapse yet again around them it later and they have a huge punished enormous with the TV coming in also from doublelift behind there's a new there's no way out so we just have to run into the turret and then try to not give up another assist but certainly huge 40 lb cuz we know the Sounder wants to be out of her late he wants to be roaming if you fall behind a zillion you can get into a situation we're just walked in your lane where is infinitely and you're just stuck that won't be one never getting to get to the silence and that was with some other Advantage both flashes burn that was both been dying so TSM on the back foot cooldown wise you can see Team Liquid up 1200 really hoping that reverse sweep home for the title they put the team together for Now is really the last window now zillion level 6 Santa can hold on to that ultimate you can overlap those food at the flash in the ultimate survivability just chugged away on a corrupting potion as the catalyst is just too difficult to make room there so she need to change their focus no longer Midland need to create something else where on the map they will have a little bit of an edge to that bottom land because it uses TV to mid lane so now they are going to have to keep his bandage they're going to lose a couple of minions as a result but I certainly nothing massive than you can even look now with Mickey at 6 to actually hack Yorkton yes he can go for a self ultimate but if you do that it set up so easily for the Devil by the zillion you can actually Altamonte starter and sitting in one place setting for the double bomb that way there's so many ways them to chain that Cece and really lockdown bjork's and who is going to kind of be behind the curve as far as that damage profile go back to the Lenny face now but so far they're okay game still 1500 apart and Siri calls come through to your she could recall that has done this year as well and I think we're going to see if actress Rena Prussia Morelos Unifour this matchup otherwise you have no chance of actually pushing the akali out you need that Grievous wounds is very very heavily in with the Ruby Crystal as well. And tell him that is my gas and we'll see a piercing can try to get out of Lane to put a swing these things around is 3 man squad up on the top side would be devastating and they're heading for impact okay flash is up told you the same here's the teleporting for one and with that cool down I'll go see a sent but that's still around that for as they call them for the mid laner the long road back to Midland yes he's going to run into the wrecks I guess I'm have warts down through the Team Liquid jungle
