yep psychic all I could picture was going to be racing riding motorcycle and sidecar with goggles on you know exactly hyperformance go this year so please do not enter any more it had such a clear game plan and I just feel like a question what you were doing is not working and I think they have to try to mix it up you know I'm not saying that they need to try to btsm an argument stop playing and play split wood but don't blind Pickett born allows solo to pick a match up that he can go even in that he can go further into the game or even get an advantage in that he's strong on Champions like you pee and he is a strong word to Kaiser he has more than just that or he is going to be a very proficient often or possible lot of texts at the Jason's in there for him so I just think they need to mix something up because right now the game plan for TFM husband counterpick top put your son is something that can go to the side lane andall resources in a Broken Blade they're donating kills they're going for man top they're diving so they're keeping on sold their you know all sing to him constantly and that he just needs some help in pic of in-depth not pricey TSM put the pressure on for actually set in the jungle this has been the high fries Ash and semah is pretty much a wash down there at the bottom Lane they can wait on Midland a little bit longer than OTF is not a contested pick p o e has not shown it and it was a difficulty for TSM when they played Team Liquid was the weight we can guarantee another tank tank somewhere else engage somewhere else in the lotto silicon actually maybe when Elena gets broken blade needs to happen baby here and they say OK Google skip a chance to kind of Macbeth Lane in time so now or you can come through in time to answer to you before the pants come through and black was finally show us a new look where they can actually kind of yourselegant actually kind of broken play exactly I think that should work a lot better I am expecting to be the fifth pick for solo now you've given what they have done is Duff's bar Santa also is going to help out so low in a lot more than the Caitlin or the Asher whatever how you can take this matchup to send an ultimate can help to this way to get them from going so hard on his own and this I'll answer looking for Dives then I'll make it so nice turn that around with the damage and shielding can be quite effective they have some very good hard engage in 5 E-5 with his Dallas cop that Santa can also help to reach back line alongside that hackerman Oriana strap the ball in the horse beat-em-up use the Shockwave off of the fear sent all over the top pretty strong combo and I'm expect that like wet this rope warband Awards Broken Blade we still have to be able to receive tax levy take away and I'm expecting to get away on Nick. Write this man really plays mostplay sin gate Campisi price to make things happen and duck to write get the setup for the carries the backline there I wouldn't be shocked to see a Pantheon bad or some other engage support otherwise I can't say exactly is it to me that that makes it feel like you wanted like you pee and I wonder if they would even spilled wine Pickett I think it's not worth hiding your support at this point the game is not being decided through bottom line your bottom line has been fined if and holding up but it has been about the plane so I really do want to see them I'd a solos pick I know this is not the traditional flyquest style they have them playing different styles but I do think that you have to be willing to try to adapt in these that the fives they are going to Blind pick the GP with that blue tube and it was something that there was definitely on the trail at the very least you know this is not formedyou can get to a point where we've cleared fantastic you can somehow somehow try to stay on the west side of the map and also the other side for the help out with the engages in a 04 Altima backline acronym goes in there and you're hoping that he does not get absolutely destroyed in the one they wanted and run over cuz if you can't die if you can you can't really see each other so really it was it was picked last time around really does not the pic I really was just coming through Lassen around as the answer when they saw the Gangplank we know it's going to be barred in the in the support role set jungle is almost certainly get a case you're Barbara's looking around but we know is picking a real. Weiner here I do I get to set up there I think I'm going to get something else so what is your Aunt the counter pick on the j3 and we'll see if this be enough third Nautilus game of the split a lot of engageddive over on the side of flyquest the game plan here is pretty clear a lot of Gucci members knowing you're looking over at the ass when you're looking over at the date the TF you drop the TV ultimate on their head in the sand in the horse send in the Nautilus ultimate sin El Tovar top you follow up with the Shockwave there on the other side it's the same plan for TSM here it's play to the sidelines look just put the map look and try to catch people out when they're enrolled agent no absorbing defend against those engages try to slow down the snowball to Ward's soul that fly Quest may be looking for but I will say I still like this this match of a lot better for solo than the previous ones we've gotten shirt NJ speech EP sure yes but you can also get to a point if you're not ran over in the early game where Jace can no longer really punish you you get the point where they're clearing out ways you can trade fairly effectively with grasp and you can survive that match a build a little bit defensively hold on and we'll see if his team could defend him enough to keep him from getting go to keep him from getting Crushearly because I do think if you can hold on early this is a much better setup for flyquest and we seen lots of times around a well a better setup a 2020 LCS finals TSM back on form for the first time in three years but are in the finals in the favorites now with a 2-0 lead up against black West who had a great year themselves the Rebrand we had three Quest we had Seaquest we have back-to-back finals 2020 has been good as organization but they are staring down the barrel of a second 03 run in 5 happen against Cloud9 just last wits it's about to happen again CSM here in summer in less they can find themselves to win and sores Gangplank is a champion that can do it was very good of the champion wild turtle has had an exceptional Center so far all split lawn and power bill finally got the counter pick the mid-length to handle beers but so far the Dane has had the way better side of that matchupthe dive is going to be a lot harder in a with that sentiment available especially postix it just so cute he must protect Solo in the early game that being said it's somewhat difficult because you have gone for hecarim early who is going to be losing out to do in priority towards that sat in the speakers going to have the advantage is far as that one we went goes igp is going to be at a disadvantage Pearl Lian unless you can really get a lot of good grass cute Ponce de Leon the on this day tactical come down I'm so you're two V2 isn't great but you need to make sure that you're there to Shadow him toward out for him to try to protect him from that set 3 doesn't affect on right now really game is broken blades way they met in the top River until the last half of health bar yeah you can eat potions but it's not believe in something went out right now is total take some more poke in an early anchors bascom's in for some decent damaged by the way Auto cue is a ton of damage report back up to make sure that trade really wet positively end of the day though the wave is still controlled by TSM in Vale hits to which is 140 help swingexactly and it's always hard as Nautilus because if you go in for that book you can talk a lot of damage on the way out he gets load up by obviously the follow you can get slowed up by the Q from the BART even if it does find the have to make sure you're not taking too much damage on the exit of getting ice here on santoor it has to be really nice for them you can see that that is already sneaking around behind this GP so it's the same thing as always the game plan in full effect was going to find himself a stun you can not eat oranges or apples 5e Centaur to yesterday but since I was already seen bottom side with no Health this is pretty rough. I think it will eventually push toward solo because it is closer to side of Broken Blade but he still going to lose a lot of minions cuz it's going to be a fast Bush by any means I use down level you don't even want to TP because you know if you TP your junglers not there be insects still waiting in the brush it's essentially just FF likeso we have to walk back to Lane which means it's going to be a free reset for Broken Blade as soon as he didn't teleport Broken Blade can actually just fully push out that way that's going to reach the tower he walks back Tulane he gets a much better file off of this and again it's it feels like like West need to be better prepared for this event has been the same thing on all three games they're going to attack your top later you feel horrible in those early levels and they need to try to better defend him and be expecting it isn't a very good passing jungler but you know is it was chickens rather than a full clear boss I bet he's nowhere near top of the game comes in instead of something you know where you end topside it tuned up and someone that I think was going to juggle them in this series and Central run has not been that in the finals and a lot of that credit is Speaker stepping up all right then last year comes in this split off of a TS macavity rundo you know I have pain has gone on as Pinot functionally a rookie he's gotten better and better and better and he's been outperforming players with seven years more experience than him I think speakers Future's So Bright in the ALCS he is clearly a mechanical got really really good from yesterday to realize how clean is guys mechanics are you extending the Shen taunt catch the grave and then flashing the Tauntaun to multiple carries things like that you just do not see very often so really it's just the experience do you need to be able to have more and more games under his belt he's developed tremendously throughout playoffs throughout this split and I think that it was future is very bright for him in the LCS and absolutely is and he could be well into winning his first title it is first full split as a starter and not just a stand-in as you said went through jungle roster Roasters at the first time she said that you got a Tumblr they want to stick with for more than a year at a time realistically in a homegrown talent that little time little bit of time Xbox AcademyAcademy on the main stage straight in the finals here of course the band back together bjornsson deadlift about frosting out of the topside yeah pretty good trade in a broken plate he's himself with refresh man who once he's comfortable on that recall having to walk back out long ago for his door and blade and we'll see what comes through the bottom side is right now there's a very big farm and now a repo nice bit of damage there about Rush Truck low but here comes with his faith canceled by a zika is in danger of blood comes through it. Just after he's done his Praises I am sorry for the cast of her speak up for the help from the store running low on health backwhat a good set of play there though from flyquest sidestepping the barbecue fighting back the Shockwave canceling the TF ultimate it what essentially is almost at school before they fight their way out didn't I lyrics in the ability to actually enter that keep it into a to be free territory turn it around and get the kill themselves Pop Rocks over the top and look at the little dual and the Q you're over on a vial frustrating damage wants to talk later canceled because I thought Pearson was going to be there flashing out but if the chart is still locked on another one does lent and then late heal from double if I missed out on the first play not sure if you want to save them or not but now we get to watch grigson get Shockwave that Ward over the wall really hang off and that was a shock wave Elgin boarding position and to me that tells me you know exactly the range of the TF ultimate because that is the spot from which you would have to roam keeping that Ward instead of just a side brush gives you full information ofhe's going to the playoff he's just hiding a Darkness a really intelligent word and quick fingers for power bi will shut that down and it's not just a place of it like yes it's a reasonably common War because it's coming from chickens down to your lane but it's also like I'm going to make sure it 5:45 this world comes down there for the TF LG Flex 2 minutes if you can do anytime before 7:30 I'm going to have Vision on the old tea and I can get him if he goes Bob because it's fine but lands at Target and good on him to do so you know you could have been right there that's the Top Lane rain generator the pink word right there at the end credits of solo and it's just now coming back up and he's really not that far behind yes is teleport is down now both of their teleporter down he's gotten post 60 has gotten the sheen by which is really win GP starts to feel pretty comfortable the flat man of flus the augmented Q obviously with that bonus to damage that makes your bearas long as you're trading much stronger so solo can kind of get into this comfort so now we're becomes much more difficult for Broken Blade to actually punished as long as he's not going to know if he's going to be so blue diamond hand it off right now if you eat first to level 8 in the game right now is the Toppenish doing Battle of good shots with your life every single Skittle shot and broke his leg is 10 gold thank you very much for the extras that lady is going to be continually push pin or the cloth overnight with another big shot glass and solo but speaker is here as well past revealed himself sweeper down get rid of the wars solo what do you even do here do you always wear a wave do you hope you can feral trade I mean if you see them at all you've got all for the way if I think he has a ward in the pit so I think he just saw speaking now yeah he does he said he never got cleared out so we actually awarded over the wall so that prevent him from having to just straight-up leave or off the wave Ace Oswego backed off after clearing that because of that thing for the credit to him forturn those words out in really solid spots that allows him to do stuff without having to overcommit do anything much yesterday Mark you're looking for for a Philly Avid s34 sign is 14 minutes that'll be timer we will track here so far he's been farming well admirable Cliff 66
