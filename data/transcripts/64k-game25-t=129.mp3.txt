just kidding of course but with that we are going to get into game 3 in today's LPL Clash will be covering the pics of men's hair from state farm animals that's going right into them things I did before things like the Lucian to send driving a few things like an idli the one where is some talk and find some top 40 the canal and exciting things like the grave perhaps you can use as well well with high priority on gin as a first pick even a conversation will be like okay is it the Grave is going to be a huge priority here it has been a band away but even when it's open you know teams opting into that Den priority in first pick in to believe in Nashville wants you on right side or seen it from both side so that they can you bend at least nearly Graves open if one of them Gets By the way I asked you miserable as well but we see the Night Champion being taken out which I think is very smart move heading back to back champions are seen when is douching he has been or have two games in a row that's the grave so I'm expecting to bed now and again first big factsthe same draft because right side seems to say the museum in the past its textbook are simple. We can go to lunch if that's going to get to the early gameplay then but even a wreck so I could be good I don't like it here is again karsa sofm legendary Gleason players and so the fact that you have been such high priority to then pivot and then have such high priority on listen to we already talked about you know how is real influence from both of these 80 carries we did see a little bit of a hover of the Calista the like this is a lot of agency a lot of like pocket picks for all of these players and when it comes down to thisvolume at 51% I can't play my opponent this is exactly the type she can't be what you want to listen to someone like me doesn't go away from your come for the pits open at this to Pickaway something that Jackie love is super comfortable on that their insurance until he's in your dream about where you can catch waves you can be safe on your own you can use your ear wait to get some reason to leave him but it can be counted it seems like I said I'll bring the tray even hear anything related to losing it because you don't have any food options to go to Center can take our paying fast for things like a cape in the Draven even things like I said I do really want him so we can hear that Mom did this yesterday pick Caden on blue side left their football picks at 2:05 to take want to go from like 8 to Morgan County so Kate and Luxe towels work better I'm expecting some kind of response from swimming perhaps as your car might be one of my brain to fold or they can just pick up.longer cuz I feel like if you don't pick up the dog around 3 they might struggle and up in the end of 45.1 paid already talked about how the Champions on Sunrise together you hit a lux binding we thought from on team liquid that comes out you can put out massive amounts of damage and now I'm sure it will double down on a schedule so I can maybe support like maybe by to take away the, to make sure the absolutely want it to be too or if a Sunni or just going to like stack the bottle and I know that they have the as well he can place a few can form from a distance and then find a really strong set up support like that Leona and then a double down on escort from finding some sort of hard farming jungler and then allowing Sword Art to be the primary dank assist or set up for that care of simple things like hecarim are still available at what time does play even if you haven't really shown at world so far so he's an old-school pick for himthreat against the Luxe valse Opus Luxe occasion is running some like a cleansing get popped in a c c combo things like the ear pops even think like LeBlanc if they want on the side of puppies for sale Hannibal composition and it's like a plpl stapling classic there for leasing but that makes a lot of sense of the team fight so I don't need things like heck out of here I'm going to things like Rectify perhaps even skarner could be good if they can find Carrie top which I think something is always believed it would have been on the horn last game if it's past time on orange decide who is playing Harry Potter the Deathly electric oven if there is no feenew things like a gangplank are also still available by Banning Pilots it does have me reinforce more like a game plan going to hack room is kind of a pic to round out the competition because I was obviously would be able to take away those big key ultimate so it does make it safer to pick those Champions would you know that night and 369 could have also taken to Silas I wonder if you might want to pick away GP here cuz he is so good to their comfort think you could only have many Pounders other than maybe some rainbow painters things like the j-6 you want to go into a ton of matchupsPittsford hecarim hits the ball delivery feels like I'm expecting some plastic countertop 369 it's such a good matchup GB fish and always have to push it looks like in to the midline of Ariana from Angel and I mean if you can look at something called you know they're diving your back line as you was playing on his own in the back line of himself so the chimney or end of the hector Mobile going in the back line Astros being self-sufficient and I liked it I liked response until Beast would still take him H don't don't allow yourself get throw pick an assassin with an old with, play soft Christmas Waltz of every single Lanediving in the backline who gets there first we've already set up the heck remike Becky there would be here if you suppose you are worried about that all my God you're so excited to record but still talk about Harvard cable first lesson is Jack's rolling he's on a leash on the sidelines I think that you have made as well spill on the riverNicole well let me tell you he wins. Fasi the single Target damage the Raptors are the Raptors going to school so you won't have a problem with that then it's really good and if you ever Your Dragon control as well because friend is really good to me Drake with a Q and A wr3 to get a decent engaged to the owner said no and you have some cycling pressure into the mid game when it's hair was down for the tunnels. The power farmingthis is about the set up towards level six maybe try support form for it to get it very early on in the making plays into the side light and most importantly setting up his top laner for Success like he's very brutal early on but you want to make sure you can get that out of the way and then make an unkillable with a channel that later on Echo running oversize fifteen52 much where is on the other side so I'm not sure they have the or they have to have a decent Team 5 confidential around stuff like this but that was so deep inside pressure so it all depends if it had your side pressure and going outside pressure you're going to do somethingboth racks of Thailand's which means we're still going to see Team fights because that's all you said you guys are excited for Games 3 thank you very much shocks and we are out of the rift for Game 3 of Tide score between top Esports and spooning in this best of 5 and already we get excitement at SUNY are going for the rest of the bottom side I think is really smart cuz you if you get a sunburn still out there Caitlin likes laying you can destroy them and then I got to go from Moore okay I will say that this they used in early Caitlin let's pick from Top Esports in the first game vs tuning in the semi-finals and it creates the situation we're both junglers not just carsf have to deal with the possibility that we have to do it a possibility of topside volatile matchups plus a Caitlin Lucks Lane which wants to Perma push want to get to under the tower wants to farm their own turret plates off that tower has the possibility of falling prey to a Leona Chen combination that's why it level one looking to get a summers fall off the bottom Lane could have been a really big thing for sooning because they want to know. can use the threat of your all in with your Leona Shannon coming down there to punish the ever pushing Caitlin Lux and you can see who you enjoy going for Summoner he'll now Guardian is very typical for sport locks it was actually nerfing building used all the time as they're going to kind of Step Up it is that you do not win any two-on-two as any Champion it is always a lead that I could walk in and auto attack and must run away makes to make a play happen but now 369 go to play Christian early on and I am intrigued with how did early game is going to play out because you have a push and topside a pushing bot side but a losing Midland cars navigate around both dreams of the map and it creates a very interesting dichotomy he's going for the red still here first this way you circumvent the problem of a Shen going up trying to help Jack's because there was that starts on a little bit but really lay her on Jack's early on and especially if you have a lease in cycling on the top side of this map by removing gen-pop side can't you make it very inefficient for the shenda go up there and try to help that match up and Carson's going up there first reads bar is charged up for 369 but he's one else is there going to be a stun what's the time in the bottom side of Shield come back out jacket way to safety for The Flash come from Sword Art comes through trade it back though it's going to be a killed him and one for the back for Lux still dedicated carriers are both team to play that lady with no fear freak when you're playing the Bentley on his side of it lets you have to follow up here on the jungle do sofm want to set up car seat in the back Little 3 for mites for help me that's what them gets me very easy take of drop and carsmith is onto pants to for right now rivershed can not be trifled with black machined flat and it might be been going you got to be kidding soon in 240 topside Fireball Jutsu BSO FM style of me on full display here but we are going to get the Jackson early lead are you kidding me this is an overwhelmingly great start for suiting gaming considering the Champions the life that they had this is a dream scenario Renekton down in farm down and kills to a Jack's bottom side already burning Summoner to Leona playing aggressively getting that Advantage there sofm forcing the early Smite for help from cars that finishes up the group and they go for the kill Bin does not hesitate this is a rookie on the world stage your semi-finals to get the extra skill and then right back at it all night long man to get sponsored. W feel does it mean too much and I can walk away back to mid lane as get shelved and looked around for CS difference in mid Angel picking up a bit hex flash behind Jackie let's go to be found out stunden play not alike he is going to fall baby wearing something to the first meet up here for sure Sword Art also sewing is style hexflash over to punish the flares just keep on coming for me to Flanigan's Jackie love like you might have one in the final but you're not against the LEC today buddy you're against the LPL we're going to take you down soon as I got off to a great start so far in game 3 night has Ulta manage to stay until it's and damage walks away night's walking into the summoner's rift in the whole thing is on fire right now is I have a head in CSI here on my echo matchup in midlane what's going on in the sides here top Esports number one LPL teeth are coming apart at the seams and it is due to sunnis flexibility something that they have been criticized for here and they have really shown up such such big moves here in the early stages now got to calm down though and look at how they play because the veterans here on top Esports still going to try and retake control the Kaitlyn luck still wants to pull the same game plan nice deep were there from Sword Art does see the hover from car seat though and they won't get it off the ground right now I mean it's Caitlin likes being on their side of the map is just such a beautiful Vision here for soon and gaming because the aggressive play from sword and how long they've been able to take away any of that priority from Angel and we got a 2000 gold difference than I got stuck on the G2 player actually because he looks like say hey look at this match if you one but if you try to find a b o v e level where is the Team Liquid Flair where's that number MSI semi-finals from last to look at something about a tail Jack you up it's like hey member losing in the spring split to JT gaming and I can tell you suck on it
