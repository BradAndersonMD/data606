loser has a chance if Genji beats are in another time when we were in the Vixen band that we sent and right now I want to see how Cloud Cloud9 go because I do agree that certain parts of the map they should be reactive I think it is primarily around the bottom line out of a licorice at the moment it's playing like a man possessed you do when it is on another level but it comes to where he's paying me and I think the cloud nine me to empower that rookie the play that has been the most consistent over this year and it looks like right I'll respect towards the top mine off Cloud 9 those 8% taken off the board first I'm not denying way the irelia a specific Target one of the things like the alista open which I believe I talked to you should look Too Faced on fasels previous game performance and it is gone all be bought later is as far as the farmers are left in the tire right away lockedCloud9 sneaky to answer desired work on with things like gin Tom kench but with Tom Ken's taken off the board to use then look to try and deny the wreck on Old you find the other answers summer considered Morgana to be a pretty solid pick as a response but to be a good answer as well as Raven and thresh are available on the Champions I've been doing them today and Raven is locked in a Tilla quite the world so far by faith and this is what you must love about your mother as a coach the ability to empower he's plays 2K take comfort in the biggest game of the year for this for that is such a brave move for Vitality go to a stage of the game I mean things like nautilis we've seen used to go to the drive-in it's just a holeopen playbook and yet he still trusts you for them when I ask you certainly doesn't we'll see how that the draft earlier in the day they will position electric template to great effect by using the cream of the crop is because it allows the teams who plays their style of Champions who else wants to play Draven threats everything else on the table. They're from your compositions the best styles for their own team to lock that spot at 4 into into the quarter-finals Vitality sticking to their style Cloud9 sticking today as neither midlane at has been locked in yet had a fantastic tournament so far will be going up against who's been playing out of heremine today and that's what I want to talk about how much is Jensen feeling it right now is he willing to go at the Italian Stallion is it going to be and now they carry because this is eerily similar to they called the Cloud 9 beat Genji with earlier today and in that matchup perfect Catalyst to get them going in the right direction what's a mid laner of slab not have a lot of Jensen's pics are not allowed right now the LeBlanc was banned Away by has been specifically and blinding syndra can always be scary. Kind of benefit of red side if you can always count affect at least one of those Lanes waiting to see if Jen and goes ba tour Top Lane by Sally want to pick one Champion for themselves of course the Scion already there I expect a jungle next up as a band away here I'm curious as to what Direction tickets will go I'd be surprised. Thing like the Kindred for the game what is already a pretty strong guy on the back line called that Cambridge ultimate tan off of valueTomcats rolling in the front line Direction they are going to be good but I laid all that great at going backwards with the exception of correct not really the case billion to make the time even friends in the top light or does it signal morehart engage with a champion like or what this been going in the bottom line is lots of ways T9 can shift this composition from 12223 carry these Cloud Nine track the amazing record that they had during the regular season Jensen on since the Cloud 9 worlds edit up against police game with your pants outfit and you have to respect to be in the first place they play that style they play but work for them they said forget the medicine that perfectly clear all about picking what we know and right now zero to the top world's 2018 they were not here they are why do pump up State NBA Gretchen maintain the game plan I'm so excited on the quarter-finals of this world championships do walk-in Topic in the last time these teams met it was probably the biggest comeback of world this year a massive effort by C9 to take down Vitality there and I thought maybe that was Bo call me when North America would get from this group seen our projected that sent you the number for down here but have a chance of being number one of course so does Vitality after some incredible for words is through a bunch of year in rookies cu9 vs. Vitality North America and Europe to lock the first spot in the top face and it is Comfort down the line for each player and to tell the story of this Cloud 9 Squad having to come in as North America 3rd seed after it is zoster is the offense struggling through the flaying state early on in the group and look like they were only going to be able to grab a victories off the other end of you-know-what out of the clutches of defeat the today that turned it around that started that come back and make the biggest potential so good it was so good against RNG they're going to try it again C9 absolutely beautiful away parvo shot he used his flash to get in behind basil they set up the Trap but they aren't able to find first level result in a likely Redbox going in the favor of Vitality foot already anniversity you bloodthirsty stuff for the flashing right yeah it was very early on he's going to be around to however at this rip-off I got to see what the doctor has to come from sticky nose with the is Leesville tap 1 North in that brush but then those rabbits need a bit harder for Scentsy on either way tickets at least a full Camp ahead and he's not going to fight for the Raptors going to let them go over and since Karen choosing not trade he could have moved up to a fight maybe trade the enemy Red spent his rest but now he's like a pool level behind because I take it he's able to steal away that red buffalo long with the rent account after that match up with Echo you lose all control I thought he was just trying to write the schedule but he wants to get in the NBA starting up tickets inside the jungle is bullying since Karen but liquid is coming downstairs to be 3D won against tickets he's pill fight excuse to its way for the elderly and you got all my stuff on me first place he's going to go down. 4 + 137 game all right let's take a very very quick breather gentleman when we reach out where do we start set up a flash grenade at the biggest thing off the back end of all the kills is it the lane to starting to do in Vitality say but that it is Vitality that has the push across the boys and then starting to go off in theater wall sits game is all about the kills on faceoffs is actually the landing phase which is helping Vitality recognizes if you thinks he can do City it to take advantage of by The Scarlet Ibis to get out then realizes it's going to try this in quite where I want it and then the Chase comes down from Jensen and licorice what's happening around the mid lane Zanesville trace the torture messes up and get changed to find the killed flashing and get a nice early payday in the Trudy to really nice stuff by him the first Rico going to come through for sneaky as he should have been to Canada wave take the defects of time but double longsword for him until of course going to be a lot richer here and pretty close Waze vs overly friendly. Children that Rico because he heard you got the money for that plus refillable or any of those small trick if he wants to pick up there while we got to think about what it means to the Vitality Raven Echo they want to be ahead Strahan still goes extremely well with just a tiny bit of gold after wants to be that split for strength so the sooner he gets those items as soon as you can walk to the sideline and assume that he could do what just do Kate does that where is. C9 you kind of expect him to fall behind in the early Lane in space do you have the ability to attack Sidelines because I do have things like the things as well as an oxidation combo who's going to play at the house be able to pick your time on the map you don't want to give too much away in response to happy ability to generate these pics just needs to be with the right set up the first Rico the film off of the top winners now they both save TP both the liquor since and the Cowboys start strength they are armed up there ready to go cuz they fight in the bottom side with holographic players event it seems likely both jungles not shadowing down your pick a spotted on the ward what's got to control yourself by the hook just give me the fight right away it's not a lot of damage he's going to stay alive and no TVs burn they're going to stay up just yet but they look around tickets you can see here behind the side seat what's a teepee down there going to go to the play right away it's going to be a slow vehicle down now forced to face Malik rounded ability if you throw it under that teleport it puts it on the full cool down so I can I didn't cancel that himself what was licorice with the heads-up play Red with ever wanted to be able to go if it's still the pressure is on skill you have the pushing Lane and vitality first of these places that was crucial is what we will get a replay of what happened to have a charge of going into the brush to try and get the t t and is exactly as you described on the interrupt coming in from licorice chews face with the ball slide kind of slowing down this Noble for Vitality really happy to stop to the bread. The second time around Spencer in season has been a growth and he's like I don't have control of much of anything here refers to as basil comes in Jacksonville join but there's already an echo this is vitality how much straight line is playing that game on the stage and keeping up a little bit of them are spies into the Animus that's was saying no need to try and force against Cloud 9 because you know they're going to do it to you you just have to be ready to react and in this instance they prepare for the White Album Beatles the Redbox and C9 respond accordingly they find themselves another kills but the cold sober even down to the waving their one Siesta Park in the mid side top length Plus for 4, Sharp and of course plus a lot down here is a tell us up 13 * 23 as I can actually count numbers and I know the tens place is and when you look at what a 1-3-1 compass able to do there's multiple areas you attach can either attack of side lengths something like if the echo that goes down top light on bottom lights and maybe try and take him out and potentially look too aggressive fun is the midline weather 3 is going to be we say seems like C9 actually this torment not respect that get 4th on and go down they have sucked I just being able to run
