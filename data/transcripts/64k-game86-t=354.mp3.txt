in the light of promoting Lord that we do need to touch on borreload getting subbed in for dignitas now he was like crunching Academy dignitas Academy you actually was struggling themselves of it but it has been one of these for a long time are set by the you so I don't think I'll be any surprises with him on the team but if you looked on this roster and you were talking about Jonathan and after we've been playing really well recently that you would have Prague Ananda Katie and everything since you came in they should be able to build something off of this maybe they can muster their first win here right off the bat do you crave still open and that is a big Acadian Champion to me when Katie was first in the steam coming up he was playing me the top Raves do Graves like he wasfan of that chance. And now that it's backing lometa I always like to see him pick it up even though they didn't have 6 touch with his previous in Boston right now go ahead and take the Appel yes we're going to grab something high priority for ourselves Twisted Fate is a cat's mid laner use thing that have her right now and likely go over to Jensen no going to pipe at the last second and I really like flying Mages into a filios because he has a lower base in Marseille if you take the Mr snapsort it still worse than if I sit or Calista did that but you're still at a lower margin of the camping might be so often times you can see that for a while and I really wanted us to hold on to the mystery of the enddo the Cassiopeia. I really like it into a paleo diet is that it is really easy to peel and you're my soul and your whole side to his belly else because he doesn't have a lot of trick he has no extra Mobility now they started with a press to give him some mobility and give him some safety wedding photographer. Trying to mitigate some of the counter pink here but I'm a huge proponent of the cat Co and the Sentra pics into a failure specifically poor Lane matchup have to keep in mind all right we need some attack damage elsewhere in our top to balance since we're facing orange one of the Premier super to take that is really going to be able to itemize very efficiently if you stacked too much AP currently with the Blitzkrieg pick up you look good are they are definitely going to need some 80's red to the last Tuesdaythrough the first phase of fixing bands Kindred May well be the second band coming out here as well Liquid Swords GZA 4th they know this was his face in the midline they know it's going to be Jensen up against Rock to drop off the counter picks might be good against it but you seem to Cotati are actually Banning away Fitzwilliam is top laners like the atrox take away the vet voiced as possible here that is still available to and Ice cool white like a set you know Xfinity for set for a blade of the ruined King either one of those version both are super popular provide good initiation for the very well with your liquids current 3 pics as well as being that physical damage threat so maybe they can follow it up with the Step Van hereYeah Yeah Yeahs any other physical damage top laners Gangplank of course it'll grow back if he certainly hasn't been Champion you know he can bring it out licorice play Gangplank so far as the split so you can do better in medical center that impact likely has practice on it if he hasn't played it yet so visible damage has to come out of one of those two lanes because of how do you have to front letter so far respecting and mail a jongleur for them as well and stacking Mr would be a danger. So I have to be the match up not just physical top laner taking it up a notch at the least ality talk later write this really put the extra pressure on I I really enjoy this picture of Olaf that is going to be a power Duo. 9 have used it totally, really just doors up the later stages of the game for Ola fit tapered off.Kirby unlock Well normally drop off later and not be able to keep Pie as effectively when carbon provides everything Olaf watched especially if you're building a, correctly might do and be does with you theme semi-hard inspector and just trying to use your meeting to materialise Urton Lane I don't really enjoy this compost but we'll see if I think both pops have a really big bro's to them I definitely like like the match up here most of the slip through the Picton bandana mean physical damage top in Jungle Mattituck in the mid and bought side for Team Liquid I know the very beginning a chocolate to cats house hoping to build Austin successes from their bottling to liquor off of a very strong early game and it's all a bit to get in the Cloud 9 just yesterday I could easily move up to 4 and 2 to put them around second or third place in the early it is not what a one-loss teams left inflyquest might be the only one about honor and so I certainly can can be at the top of the standings in the second and I like what you could have done with this trap it gives them a lot of options for them out playing and then creating a space on their opponents this is not a sit back and relax Team Liquid team cop they need to get on it early here and they have the tools to do it all right we are on to the red what it's going to this game is going to be exciting what is dignitas takes on Team Liquid unfortunate start here for dig but they're going to change the roster around Laurel o steps into the Top Lane for Viper and they're open. Is going to be the little bit of extra that they need as well as back the discount is built around Johnson and aphromoo in the bottom side is Johnson has been great has that price of Helios to let it go for an early invade spotted out very early Ward coming down TL known on this brush The Haunted Hathaways my way in herepaycheck doesn't look like any danger though cuz they didn't go the Deep route on the invade and he would make the quick pass through to drop off the ward hear the one big thing that they have to worry about is the Olaf if not for the Olaf Team Liquid will just run over this early game if so many options with Twisted Fate plus lease in providing crowd control for the lease in to get in there for an effective gank Jay's Place lease end also can be super effective early and of course the blitzcrank on bottom side trying to capture pick into the flds dress combo so that's why I say he liquid this is not their normal sit back and relax we're going to scale up to later 45 they have been drafted themselves so many options so many tools to create action for the fan ceiling fans free really like tracking Olaf jungle pathing we got a KTM doing pretty standard drops to the 2nd right through that key was he finishedover and save a little time right there obviously a lot of damage to my mother's Olaf I want to track how fast he gets that level up right we had bladder getting ugly was level 4 at under 3 minutes then getting halfway through cruggs by you know before the 3-minute mark so I got to see the Katy can make that would happen for himself obviously incredibly probably pass through the jungle is could always remain ahead of the opposing side taxi and told at the top of his money back and forth in fact the key of course as pretty much everybody is well aware of now with her lots of getting yourself in potentially extremely low off the blue and drop some people will use their W early like as soon as I get to love with you but if you want to go as low as possible for the extra tax lien mean while be a top-down clear out for rocks are on the lease in and he's not going for the super super early influence their off of level 3 I think he's going to do more of a full clear if youstart to get behind in levels to olop Which Wich can feel inevitable at least it because people are so fast to be time to really really difficult to actually go make your offensive plays without 100% hours of where Olaf is because you have a good kind of game to get smashed in it and he's been really needs to pray off of those balls level 305 Rick 18 by the way is the mark they're going to talk to see Lisa and not a fast the jungle in is not going to help his team if you can watch him helping tea on the bottom side trying to fight for scuttlebutt it means there is a level lead for taxes potion does not have that with that I can you set and go for the top down clear yet again can you please do so we can see the drop respawnbasketball for it they got some reveals they're not there anymore but realistically if you want a flash follow that's good at least one slice of a Jensen again will get top speed of a problem and then to go for drop the top 10 clear that little Skirmish there are bottom river is exactly why I recommend the more full clear for Lisa's and not wasting sometimes trying to steal away into sneak away and don't have a way from Olaf because he's clear so much faster he's always going to have his level for advantage over you unless you have a really powerful lead in mid and bottom for both of them to the last debate we win the crap for you you're not going to do with a fight them off it and can we could make an attempt at it went to the blue and then that you sometimes trying to send again to trap. Because this early you don't have that extra priority either if your land has never been slain that is one camp that Roxas does not have that by comparison of Kayden is already clearvia the maps that is a golden egg recall comes in just below five minutes I'm going to fight for uncle and this first-rate we'll see if that one comes down KTM on the earliest record Wrangler certainly doing well three camps ahead Chuck Lorre low write him vs. impact Top Lane is going I think just fine when you're the or early game but honestly holding up pretty well and honestly with the extra minions in front of his Tower he might be able to selectively so then and catch right back up I took it a lot by the help over here we go big Play Already Here Comes, they've got rights in the council comes through first blood it's somebody say bottom layer free because afro blue and Johnson have been doing everything they can to get dinner talk on the board with the winning the ALCS and they do it againteleport is channeled by frog and just to ensure that they can get that killed but man that was all Johnson and afro move to pln Tactical get that bill and this is weird fact about having class here to do just the good news from Africa flashing in with the play and then looks like she's not want to disappoint you. Already got into the slow of play I have a good if you plant an apple still hook you in the death sentence then tell me how you did but you're probably going to die next time to in a Flash so absolutely perfect gun was up there for place as well so we had to follow up route like realest me they were just too much ground control to deal with and it was a nice black play exhaust guaranteed it exactly after I moved back on track feels nice to see him making some big plays and now it's this way to you can see I'm trying to ask you to help out with the Visions fire boom as well as throwing down the wards around it for froggingplay there's a light special and has always been able to kind of the exact playing like they'll pause and a new via a lot of these more often at a champion. Super heavy Farm only stayed and rain but you're taking up a Karma looks like he's going to be building for the same as well drilling for Acadian I like this new look uses his first teleport early down bottom side just to ensure that it's a good bottom land something definitely gets the kill and he's playing a lot more for yeah I would say I would totally agree with your sophron constipation I think I always though he has been one who plays many champions are number one of those conversations I have with him when he came to North America play the LCS he said hey what do you want to I want you to guess my highest win rate Champion Pro play and that Ori I know it was that you at 3 and then back into a 2014 playing on Elias well it was funnyulcs with Alliance so low and behold nice angered boxes I know there's nothing you can do about it but he butt dialed you play them right back out flat for Jensen back in the brush shields on again knocking for Lauren aquilina. The kill shot glass turns around 4 today tries it for good measure but either way it seemed like there was a fight to the one I like the accident here that's attempted getting into historyplay dark and I have any events at 2 kills on to the JC ER for impact it looks like he's actually going to go the more Amana build as well so shut the early tier and additions usually Valatie this extra
