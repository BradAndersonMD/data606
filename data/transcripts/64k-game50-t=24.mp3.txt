the guardians but they have changed things up know they're figuring out ways to get it inches through flying or broken play try to pick on hot surface they have figured out how to at the very least neutralize the bottom light is not Monumental as damages from FBI as it was in the previous series and importantly or last two games they have taken FBI off of a true carry threat he has been locked on Santa and it is at the band again I want to see golden Guardian Spanish please do not go to the same draft you just lost on three times in a row and and they are not been able security for TSM if golden Guardians go to Santa again I will be so disappointed honestly I feel like guess I'm really kind of figured it out yes will the Guardians 2/10 of course thank you a different pic it is not the Senate this is something that is going to give U agency will she be able to adjust as far as that the support pick to protect its Ash that is going to be with us because with Calistaespecially if it is paired alongside something like the thresh worth Liotta again that can be a very aggressive All In Style against the ask similar jungle Gardens tried to pull off in the previous game but with work Lane agency Whitmore Village is no ball and more of a stable Pick 3 from PSM last game like the golden Guardians candy has a lot more against it is important for the team fighting over wrong you're not playing you know squishy back line damage which is what we've been doing a lot of here I'm curious if the rush comes through or some kind of different team flight answer looks like 10:10 get dicey in the mid game when he starts this more attack damage but like teepees give me the name of the game for this game and we'll see how he can perform because his last tenant game with remember was against steel Gmonstrously strong game there are nine kill Kevin game where he actually ran over CLD so the text Ralph is split so is tied or at least was tide coming in this series with Laura Kaiser protectant for his mostly see what a paring is going to be you know is it going to be something new something spicy or is it going to be more of a stand origin of French style pick up in a little bit weird for them if you bat Morgana then they can just go thrash any kind of cell found in the counter because they have the next pick they may be willing to go to words of Tom kench and if you're okay with that then jerk that's right you go to work with TK and play that defensive style that you will be sitting pretty much all control in that Dooby Doo coming outMonte has brought it out in the past week off also goldenglue playing it yesterday so okay they're going to fly into send look at a weight on support and go for counterfeit with marker has gone I thought we were going to see fresh I thought we were going to do that come through with a okay we're ready to go like you can play it was a few days but no no no we're going for Lake Domino's in the mid lane we're going to have magic damage deletion coming through trying to FaceTime can check in and say look pick up live and they want to bully at on kitchen light right back to it this is one of his most played all time he is really well known for this draws so many zillion bands has been monstrously good on its rather than Tire career newest 72.4% win rate across 29 games he hasn't nearly 10kt as well as is more kind of like I don't want to get counter picks and if you're worried about the thrash cuz you think they could go Tom can soon after getting it into this does go okay but my issue with the bar compared to something like this rash is it I really have the same kind of reliable defensive utility right and I think that's get them is basically saying we're going to depend on your shin to be able to keep the ash alive but the amount of dive that is here is really Red Barn plus Ash you know what ya with Pantheon or even if they went with rush I think I should break like a Zyra SS or biofrost and if your bottom line losses this game as TSM there is not a beer can orianna to just like take over the device as far as the damage output is required he's not he's not on Oriana just going to buy again so SS has to do well in lane at 2nd Ave e that worthy Target of getting buffed out then sped up and res Garden do diving kill him and this is a mash-up that's going to be interesting to watch for here I would say silly and is it a kind of pic into Central we talked about Tom ketchel zillion just does that thing by altering the Target and send it to me again where you can revive them we're going to trade Olson that's going to be okay with us the double bombs done versus the cinder East Dundee that's going to play out down the line but you really can ruin a lot of the golden Guardians play style what might happen to you on this side as we kind of wait for the game to play out make the players to load in and for us to get gameplay footage is how kind of AOE can the Golden Gardens Tampa right now because unless you change done whatever is going to be revived back to full HP and if you blew 421 and got nothing you lose that fight every time but if I can get for people to 20% health and then you're ready for the follow up with hurricane Calista when I was the only take one person that matter the teammates are dead Devil comes back out but he's like oh I'm surrounded got it okay I'm Dead 2 for the second time and what they actually look like as the game plays out I'm also to be super excited to see about Frost can pull off one of the the really kind of strong defensive tools for The Bard against the kennet because you can prevent the Canada flag by simply Aldean right if you can spot him coming in for a team fight and actually Alton before he can get in on top of your team that can buy you time to create space actually back up from that Kenan disengage out and you have to remember that similar to how the Caitlin bar combo work so you could do the same thing with Dillion you all someone and you drop two bombs on their head they come out they both immediately attach the same person you are set on you take that damaged so if you do get hit as you're trying to fly in with the E on Kenneth by that bar all to bits is a very easy turn on to that guy I believe there's there's anything a skin reaction here cuz this is my recollection of seeing a zillion thrash in the same game if you are bars open in town if you're standing right click and you're in range and Lantern you will grab it in time I think you may still be done but you will actually fly out I believe that is like there like a good frame allowed to click that lets me win but yes I mean no stopping the pain the case when he's very important I'm also curious if there going to be a locket in this game was going to buy it because if not a lot of good virus. It's really good against either way we've got a lot to talk about in this game it's game 5 of this back the last game of the weekend here for the LCS and it's an elimination battle the loser of this game is Dunder 20/20 season is over between the 4th and 5th season of the LCS 2020 Summer split regular-season dies and have not made world since 2017 and it would be another year on that market to fill to close this one out on the golden Guardian side they won their first playoff series ever go against TSM themselves and need to do it again to move on to phase Cloud9 next weekend for the LCS is third and final world spot Cloud 9 win the winner will see if I can come through we are out of the rift it's just going to be so exciting and I agree there so many turn things I want to talk about I doubt we saw speaker have this incredible nidalee game last game but we talked about how did Ali can look if you don't get ahead last game he got ahead it looked incredible everything was going his way we'll see if you can actually replicate that same pics s this time around we also have the bar W starts with starting to Healing strides dropped all three four beers in in the mid length it doesn't wait to essentially you know 225l there about 4 the nurse is a health potion and a bit so it is quite as soon as you get more levels becomes pretty eating a simple when you have more men into your stuff on the Back 9 in 1 shot that but the early laning does if you have quite a quite a bit of practice actually far more effectively Yorktown obviously one of the best in the business at playing this Champion do and and then we just got to watch this bottom leg is FBI on Cliff that you know the champagne is one that really can take over I can dominate the game and they have is killed by laying against the ashes Bard we're going to be very much on the back but we're going to have to see the bush I want to see if it would FBI off of the Santa can't he just run over this game can you get the map update advantage of Snowball the Dragon's Nest secure a spot in the background it is of course the early game for this list to build hail of blades you sometimes need legal Tempo not surprised gopher leaned on it ruined you pick a champion to do when laying the trash can do very good overall I can go well. He's running cleanse cuz you're probably just dying to ignite plus ballista combo so it makes sense there even though you're not against and asked if he picked himself but them to watch for have it also means that his you know first he he like I'm going to be lower if there's ever a flag or something but look at the Hopland Focus from tsf they have pushed concert in tirely off the wave he is bleeding Farm United get XP on the Canon I just barely walk in the rain to that one friend level 3 but so much pain we still don't be afraid of what's going to be to go for it looking for a Joplin maybe from the side that's it but hunter is bleeding gold and leaving at people speak about the top side and I love that even over commit to it will see if you commit to this level two closers going to Live skit First Blood and broken play T-Pain sound so hot outside your house single digit that is insane I'm not sure if they were trying to give that'll work at ashore not like watching for more time this is level 3 on the jungler on both of our leaders against level to hear to not a lot of ability to Al play Bob Ross night it was a flashlight that he does flashlight and then goes down and then probably miss thank you Auto yeah yeah and he misses slices well late actually go for the straight up kill instead of trying to fiddle around with the lantern there you know if that you landed that is a kill that is double bus going over and that is you know maybe not worth it anymore for Golden Guardian in this case you do all that great work that they did up on the top side Bounty Hunter off of everything is now a kind of for nothing because Hunter a TV advantages up in farm and now free minute if you're not going to go near closer for a few flash that could be a possibility or the wall instead so flash burn for the Rome and golden Guardian so many times in this split this year they have had a great for the game and a lot of the times they have failed to close out in the series against TSM so far they have had some stumbles in the early game but like in chocolate here they don't worry is butthole slightly off at the sweeper biofrost was spotted didn't know it and who he sadly guess is a little bit wrong in the distance very very close their eyes you say that has been there I mow incredible early game but maybe they're going to throw in the making that has been the golden Guardians that we have seen and brothers series that is actually been the opposite you know they have been losing the early games to CSM and PSM the first two games wasn't able to close out an execution down the stretch this time of his back more to that kind of standard play you are expecting out of out of golden Guardians know they have an early-game advantage we'll see what they can get done with it and thankfully for the first one so it's not as bad as it could be the person has the early Catalyst completed this is always a great item purchase when you're playing this match of the pacifically you do like it back a little bit of house to just give you the HP to get through any potential Lisa Left Eye first we can survive to get that all turned off and coasters down here again so they make it but right now on the top side of the map this going to be a plate taken and there was no Chance season 2 episode of Steve Jackson thing we saw half of the hots for the beginning of the game so you are not allowed to lose the gold Luby St Appleton biofrost Elaine Benes you expect out of fresh Calista so far so good on this side is golden Guardians will knock them another wave but now could you have a second time because now speak of must have reacted if you must be nearby controller Xbox closer easy Lantern away plate number to One Auto V my there's no length of a FBI safe for a bite so this is got to be frustrating for Dublin tomorrow for Ogden and closer has definitely been paying a lot more attention to bottling in this series and speak ass because played much more Top Lane Century style throughout this Series has been working out for them but as a result there has been a number of times we're SS bolts are falling down on the farm and table is having to secede waves. Because he's missing them or anything but because those are is there has been really good with his pressure on the bottom side rough the games and no really trying to play that role of a facilitator he is not on the. Of time you go to be playing a koala bear table is laying that is his job you know when compared to a used to be super strong and powerful almond doing all these things clothes are just wants to get the wings going Medusa with the blue bump and dump right there as Demonte gets the expected pick up there going to be another archangels pick up here on the mid lane going for more raw 80 it's more bursts overall stations off and also it's more defensive it's just a Lil Bit
