on this stage has work so hard this moment to become champion let's start off with the strategy coaches for both sides have gotten into the band So Far Away Solo in Focus here has been what are the best players in the league kills outside of that Midland clearly focuses on the side of TSM Banning away the tarek of that so no Tarik bottom Lane as well as the chase that it was a question of what kind of storm impact with over and over again in here even pulling the Jays fan Broken Blade willing to get that off of his plate their star talk later or is it going to be more about Puritan in the 1B want that he will have with Jensen we've seen such great things out of broken play coming over from the TCL representing turkey so well in the LCS and that has been such a successful strategy already with their Tom Kent that alludes to a possible split push later in the game even harder for impact if you want to play carry versus carry you are blind pig very likely additional meanwhile on the side of Team Liquid great team Fighters have been locked in galio very good AOE also a lot of certainly mix things up in that side lamp I want to talk about because North America we have seen with such a strong showing throughout the playoffs in Jarvan has been struggling has not been waiting out in the Radeon spiffy to be able to perform in game 1 and Acadian specifically on the wrecked by this has been his best champion this split huge carry performances from him early on in the tank and very heavily getting those so Lance going may have wanted to go for here if you wanted pack on a carry this is something that is a bit of a signature pick for him that he's been able to survive on to withstand the onslaught of a game and it will be denied me to think more and more that Broken Blade last week that it will be about that carry purses carry top and it does look like we are going to have a little bit of split Focus are there really a band has come through trying to chip away at those carry champions for Broken Blade Top Lane is the name of the game I'll wait to see you as a middleman I gets banned away as well recently had six on your screen to time LPS LPS throughout his career Jensen Elaine dominant Midland player on the world stage tourist history on this day Champion cover tells a story the birthday earlier in this season and he will be so easy for a number one we know if your son is excellent at that champions do this for Jensen or impact barma teer very likely made that you are a spicy Pittsburgh A1 let's go number 1 opening a stronger this is nothing but excellent going to come through for Broken Blade to match up the tenants but we got spicy fix liquid side like you wanted as well as a hybrid Vigor ultimate grenade what's the wave consistently throughout the game that will try to attack early in the game early on post level 680 to land from piercing hurting or grenade exactly is what brings the combination to get that will charge up your big lasers that come through and allow you the possible want to be two scenarios and its BLTs bring put a title and a trip to the mid-season Invitational internationally as well and TSN had the same goal picking up Sven and making a few more changes so they got here in his first time in playoffs straight to file Regina on the wrif going to be dropping down these turrets trying to block the paddle stars avoid damage avoid set up from Zoe in the Midway you can hear both these teams are crowd favorites the ascent at the Lion's Share for the history of League of Legends in North America but TSM have returned to the finals to find Team Liquid in their spot back-to-back defending Champions here with the MVP on their team bottom line trybus War does go down will see a possible Jarvan at red side Scuttle pathway down here spent and smoothie do not want to start it off getting ganked ubernick Summoners if you are on the side up to you said you've got to be thinking through all the possibilities of why they're going for the Heimerdinger of what this means for the game this is not something you are used to whatsoever and the Scuttle oven doesn't make you have to worry a little bit until he shows on another Ward splitting of the jungles very highly possible here does not get the knock up on the crab so he's only going to get the armor shred from his cue Pierce will take a little bit longer to finish off that objective rewards down across a pond River really spot which I was up too early on with a game but a gangster if somebody can cut bottom lamp to be a spot of going through all that careful about where that level two Jarvan is because that level 2 game from Jarvan after Red Bluff is so so strong and we have to highlight once again I supposed to flush the Waverly on you can see Jensen there with these candid mean in addition to that Top Lane with the Canon pick into Vladimir even though overshadowed by the time for dinner or pick also supposed to be a pushing Lane for Team Liquid early and it should allow Xfinity the agency here on Jarvan to keep track of akkadian track that rek'sai early on in the game will it be the full on 80s with Bushmills hear from him is it going to be some of the hybrid Bill 226 thinking in like the gun played for the full on a p i want to buy Rush the protocol because that's what I'm expecting from Spotify the scryers Blue Moon ice cream in the Middle Lane here by Pearson Farm is equal across Beast flashing as well put an early jungle tracking is objective here from the bottom line is they pushed so exhausted as well as fat or JJ though it's early game jungler out of his jungle setting the wrecks I behind is certainly pretty worthwhile in breast side without the Flash's you are so much less effective for a Canadian what does battle back to pretty low HB the forestry call put peroxide back in has the blue Smite now full resources back around to farming attract any more later on and farm over all this game really close small leave it outside in the jungle lead also pay some dividends mean when all the extras to stay in here in inventory Forest Bend could do a lot of work for CSF he has the biscuit he has the extra help husband at his disposal you can see how far back is Broken Blade had to play this is one of those people talked about especially for the very end of the regular season could impact hold on and carry mystery match up it's all he played up against flyquest that went well against Viper now broken so far so good for the candidate will have to see if time goes on at who takes hold up gladimir go to scale extremely well early on local that are long cool down Sonic you definitely hurts to stay and he's been trying to get that CS at his throat without giving up too much play damaged minutes go early on he refused to get money through the to replace exactly and if you know if you're not able to accomplish by Vladimir will hit a point where you're at level nine you have for your Kindle gem you have your feet by senior CTR stacking up and you can't pressure of any more damage look at me through it level five. Doran's Shield make an easy the same there's the rank 3 Q heels again and Broken Blade is still staying alive and how to restore it so he'll stop being denied for not being denied so badly either is your bushes down whatever things he can in his mid lane wait to see the next round of Brie causes Jensen in Jacksonville to the top of their first purchases and very deep in enemy territory right now and XFinity peeing on this wreck side in the top back they're going to find the guy Michael's thrift store better adhere Team Liquid okay to use Flash early on in the game there was no way out for acadians RTL are able to make that collapse and shut down early game of this rek'sai getting rid of some of the movement office as well as he pops the blastco turn ensures that that top jungle is not going to be too exciting but I kill one more time he's spotted us going to get out earlier they are peed out on Acadian they knew you was going in here at Smithy use it to flat stone still has the EQ left over and they're able to pick up that kill without expending any Summoners up their own broken play try to fight back and Noah Pratt that makes I pretty easy can't get the last in power to off but still HealthPark Damage Done in fact o t was teleport list little harder time and is laying down with that like steel and it's starting, unless you're certainly in the past I would have said this vs play The Group Inc that sells mean your slippers for we have seen a couple times in the playoffs are very well may be a bit of a hybrid build and what it does give you is a bit more of that sustained when you are going to be in this poke matchup if you rush quote about you can't get out today if you can't get poked out and help you have more staying power Dragon start up here by Team Liquid Xfinity on the bottom side with a control board and a pushing bottom Lane means that Team Liquid will turn their eyes for the first objective of the game and claim Cloud Drake that's a video on the clouds feet of the finals so far this is Betty picking this one up no problems there Smite gets the honey fruit able to walk away pretty easily and look at this game nine hundred to a thousand pound for pound on papers. You the better players and Laney phase is going their way now for a dive by side only very well played Zoe Redemption I do believe
