look for that want to see some spice pics will see if we're going to get that Mortals Academy I got the cash but one of their games last night and they probably an absolute Banger of a cough we had putted Nocturne top so I don't know if we're going to reach that level of crazy here as the team's themed much more towards end of the standard meta pics but there is answering to get some surprise big sister is also can I use the academy Squad as a way of testing kits for letting you know they have them play and practice of these bags and sneak in what are the strengths and weaknesses of them and that actually be transition to LPS yeah I'm through here before the band though mostly as a top men's let's can go to Botley with level or High pretty much been down there as well.one that I wasting most Morton and Nathan been in the Outfield are the LED so that's been off the table that is a bit of a surprise doing that is going to be the last been here for dla but it is actually left up so it would not be surprised he headed to use this immediately snacks out unless they're really not comfortable so I can rent around is just such a powerful thick at the pro level when you are really playing this at a high-level it is sometimes feeling pretty Unstoppable and afelio so so there really a traitor powerpyx spla does give over the most heartfelt Bakery Campion but they do graphs that they forgot what I was going to grab them a lot of really power yeah one of them is the Keanu who though she's been banned the lot in North America what if you're actually quite some timeweird we can talk a bit about ourselves it's one of those things where I think often times people leave it up against players they're not thinking you're comfortable playing right cuz Keanu is a champion where you have to really be a master I think of that you can you play it well if your pH level for the farming I can't it's not good at also know when you're playing it from the jungle is mostly where has he professional place and do it but you know she is like 15% tax to beat level 144 jungle clearance so that's part of why she's dropped off the table here as well as a flex a collie and a set which is only a top laners yeah. Stephen Flex Fitbit if I actually go to call you back if I could see it right you just survive forever and then dumped her out of the crowd and like there's a kill their add to the case of this kind of Victories have got to seen very much of it but then againI just think highly of someone has never really good to be able to walk her down and actually kill her off you could withstand them that and they looked up before me the out but there are also some juggling a lot of set in a garlic ice cream play it obviously it's something that could come out we haven't seen it yet in North America as a jungle pick but it has a strong jumbo clear you can be this kind of Frontline cranky guy that feels that sing Rollie study of legible than experience the volume like runs trying to fast but it's like it's Worth Texas tonight if you speed up itself actually makes your gang a lot more effective than you would think. And when you have their feelings by + canvas cloak easier to accessas a jungler benefits of the top winner but that is no longer important leasing getting locked in that for sure it is a truth it's not about least been has the for fuel on the go for their top players for the fact that I strongly believe the pics in the stat should be picked that you are getting more of the Farmland in and you're not really in a Philly future acting a lot more to Kaiser people let that makes tfue exactly what I prefer to think a lot more when you already have our to get on the bus side I play a farm with GP looked going to stall that out but they are going for the more Kaiser so we're going to have to pee andbut actually match up well and bra with set that you know almost always you're going to be winning a ring for you if there's a lot of guys are all you're getting a lot of stats and when you are using that against a champion like set but I do think it's actually I mean I could buy them or type II feel like a win all those heads of Scrappy melee matchup I'm not sure how to fix stylist on his way back in the bed last time cast of Academy we had them on sale on that pic and the champion and he was really the reason they won the game it was just because they were stacked lipid Academy over their way back into this be a reason to this season I guess I could say is they're looking at zero in 3 but I think his way back and I think he's actually pretty good takeover off can't really know he's not just very wellchampion and back to to last year than as I went to call Lee and then filed for so popular has a pretty good alternative fuel there for the one the one I taken with your collie alt mordekaiser ultimate fall through a pretty good one I do also enjoy doing it on to those are the main ones that he is going to be looking for a fairly good matchup I would say there for you to eat your pasta Auto that way we can reveal the apollyon deal damage it if you're cute as a week and there are some options are they do have to go to combat that alright we are on the road and liquid Academy doing battle lost the Cloud 9 today but they can go 3-1 here in a cabinet liquidhow to tune to end of their week as well right now pretty standard spread of players looking to figure out who's going through yeah well I got to pay your mortgage is going to be any real loved one moves at this point take my time he was coach Kelsey mahanati is Kelsey you haven't caught up with you in quite a while you have some you play as the old kind of going through some changes has anything going and having a lot of fun and the working out things trying to challenge ourselves a little bit every day so close to legally take me to hear what is something you expected or was that kind of a gift for first pick they probably have a strategy into it I can kind of see how the strategy might go so it's just down to who I think is better she was really prize Concentra as well but it seems calling now and what's more Pantheon in the light from him it's even kind of opening up his champion pool as well yeah I think his waiting for new lease on the way there so we just kind of look for more flexible things making him kind of challenge himself a little bit more but I met you guys around the map doing more things along those lines and I think he's been taking really well to it back to the base of the call thank you very much basic time of fight in the bottom side to pay $3 back and forth get again waiting for you on this way isn't actually is a lot of these teams will spend a couple hours with a graph represents the coaches well. Okay we got to plan for the day when I was going to go it would have broken his left off throw like a 20 or graph out the window you like well I guess I don't matter because we're playing the champion with a call you in one of the really funny things that can come sometimes happen is when something is on Burn Ban a lot of prose will talk to will just say no no I just don't even say that anymore because they never expect actually get it so they'll go to stop practicing it they stop practicing against it because they never think they're going to have to play it on stage so becomes a waste of her time and never gets left out sometimes that can work out your contract for his birth of plastic play out in First Blood come through for contract that really nice typing from contract year does a full body side clear into that game before recall and is coming over the wall and being able to punish the trash around 2 in the Box I dislike the second knockout repeat gang you just runs right back around same Route One More Time both of violators Dead 3 and 1/2 minutes in here for TL Academy under these off to a great start to hold my hand ganks and good luck to you Ally on this one this is already after a really rough start this year for my gun go is he's going to take away the topside jungle so here is initial play as it's just a bro Freight over the wall a great that have passing in and I like titties go straight for the Gratiot trying to take that said more to Target of the evelio to we would have been tougher to do and then the tunnels already there it hasn't been killed off hacks with this faucet Circle does it right again cuz you said not respecting the damn cat flap available that full-time and just a pretty big Miss play from him to not actually flash out of there and surprise guests leave for Philly go to 31224 is the way to clear it out 25 I guess but that's the full weight Advantage takes a recall going to come back in the lane with a longsword the post-awards and all that set up fax it off good job coach Kelsey controller spot on the four members of first recall be there to see this until a few that is pure coaching get us out of the board so shut up for that it's always going to be a good thing to see in the steps to is actually seeing them plates and good spots right after you can grade them on that later on freak but I will like you going to be up and experience because he did get the takeaway you that blue side of the pond if she is naive Bayes do just enough power for me here on the league and he is sneaking into this brush to see if they can punish bake out a little bit but could be tough to actually knock him down more to the east on the lease in Fallout could be there is a duck for not slowed good sides to buy fake get to the fields lives but that's worth it. Splashdown yeah it doesn't depend that flash because he got a little bit too close that facebreaker came in Clapton together on that allows make him to get in there for the then just starting up the Dragon Ball in priority so happy lights hundred thieves are already out to a 1000 + gold lead and be adding the dragon to that and give me feeling really good about how these early minutes are going to go badly kept Jacobs ear that's that really fix that was kind of afraid to get away probably pick up a set but it went through top play the gate came through enforcement a flash so we might still be peeking for too long for the cake into maybe a kill but fun for them at Bay Area under the sea by the two pills the Breakthrough as well contract now has run away the flat style fine but everything and that is on the board he does find me everything free and they're going to take down trying to act like you're getting me killed there is going to be doing really good about that flash was down for contracts of the punished was available I can get to hold onto his flash at it just as divorce owners use black seed grass that kills them like a real V6 with black available here pretty shortly in may have an opportunity to look for one more kill tell my wife to come through the top side is Jenkins but cannot find more damage in a whole lot but still cleared out next to me keeping that pressure up trying to enable contracts to get these double to fight for vision am I can spot it out by the store but did not know it was the Brady they have to push so greedy is up here and it was a defensive control where there is going to force my camera back off a little bit that's going to leave a little bit of time to try to delay Mike young make him have that blue buff reset wasting some of the time they're for Mike he'll have to go to the topside and won't be able to hand over that blue bus to usually just yet and he's he's he's very low on man at this point does a very trying for a little bit then but that's not going to do too much and this is one of the difficult part about playing Amanda bass Champion into an energy-based Champion such as a collie as it extends further and further because more inequalities favor because she is you know that resource was truly but essentially right never going to run out of energy comes back so quickly Wellington timer 20 seconds to pull all the way up until cable turned out to get you always be able to feed both horses every single way. Same here for you to lie on the styles for now if I put the top side NFL teams make it to play try to get there early on the game and put their planes over the fight comes in 19 to hook them to the silly go not going to tell you just yet but a hundred things to listen to go forward on the top of the ones you spell that way no one's getting out of this one is banking than make out of by sometime I can handle all the cow is going to go down 140 now Jenkins that's why I'm running away gets reveal their just kicked out of the all by Mike Yung so really well played by him think I'm not able to take down things but they do Fords have flashed on the back of that play and down Summers from
