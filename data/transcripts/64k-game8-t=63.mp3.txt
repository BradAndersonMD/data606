O'Reilly this short cooldown for cloud nine and it actually was not successful utilized one single time that game that's what this team has been applauded for hire walk-in tournament they are very well-coordinated they are also very good individual players they also need to start getting their individual credit they have shown up very big here in the lock and turn them in now on red side though they do probably go with the same standard bands does D'Elia follow hear the maybe we do have fudge I'm going into you or Duty or or just plain front lines with some sort of hard and Kate Spade purse details of ID expect a a top-line change for that though I expect one here as well I didn't really like orange booty for fudge it was one of his worst performing championsBraves was I think similarly lackluster so maybe it really is going to Orem UT down the line I'm not sure either way though yeah I think whatever has been good and I am curious what this crap is going to look like because we talked about fudge replacing licorice we talk about first replacing Misty Bells keep mine is taking over as head coach and instead of rebirth for Crappie engage base tile for game 2 or game 3 and we still were not really sold it and they're cops have looked that good you know this is a coaching changes bring a recycling first team head coach has been around the block for a while but there still a draft I feel and it's kind of execution and with the players it one of things I had felt the payoff is still much disengagement previously weave with no car got to be so aggressive do for work a thing we're getting going to get at least some of the pieces and it's similar look here Lulu also locked in to provethat's the port can be a normal Cloud 9 coffee doesn't make it a tight back and she'll top that doesn't need you to have those supportive no Tennessee Tech to come from and you can have the heart come from somewhere else you own a and who deer have very good tools that you can't use as we saw a little bit of extra something to get there probably from the top play it again we're building this up all the way towards the end of the draft for that take care of meanwhile hundred thieves are flying picking their eight socks with the security 9 that they can throw band number four and five towards fudge the further Whittle this down a bunch more pics of caixa for FBI Hillary a bit of folk if you really need it but honestly there's a strength is that you could always follow through on your team's Hart engaged one of his biggest ranks as you are always going to be there putting out the damage on the priority targets already been locked downrescue team music all broken hearts brawl controls the bottom Lane seeing the Lulu here that has been honestly gave the entire season so far on Moonstone seraphine was still be highest damage performer on his team not going through any of the damage build season he's still out for the most this is been trying to kind of one benign cuz he's not going to help with him right now as therapy jumper cables well yeah he was good on both those Champion so he has been the most consistent carry for cloud nine ever have been our players that's far for tonight so those are the two players getting 100% of those two positions and walking in the Alistar would be huge I thinkyou should lock this hovering over it takes it away from the cloud nine side because Lulu they've already shown that willing to flex it around definitely could be of course wanting to watch for is where it does go we do the 8 drop the Top when out of town but he's going to leave Midland for last year galio is still an optimist and been through that shape has outstanding tahm kench going to be alongside it not huge pumpkin fan personally Lulu is going Top Lane still and it means once again we only really have one strong silent for cloud nine with begin comes around it is going to be interesting and already you know people are going to theorize what went on and on about 9th Grimes last week that that led to this kind of look for 5 for the team looks like he is on Lulu Duty once again at least it's a start does overall in the weather right now but that's provide still that Dave D is for a decently well to with other male a supports and honestly I'm kind of looking at this Lilia ticket in New York is that be one of the most frustrating matchups Fort root beer because Lily at that have so much control if she comes to the fight having previously stacked up active if not take me to your can't get on top especially with the face red and blue flashing and flashing on top you can stay with in the rain and get inside the q's if she doesn't have her passive preseason stacked up you can get the taste out if you can't though then then it actually turns into she keeps you at range stove for frustrating long with a swirl seats float with the burn on you constantly with the ques so it's going to have to be a pick and choose your moment here for bladder on Udyr and again you expect very heavy PVE Focus especially early on from this Champion the biggest ranks for Luger have been near the adaptation of tiger attack speed bump on top of all the Phoenix bus that really get the most out of those Phoenix box not your Phoenix Phoenix bear at 4 even kill at level four was not enough to win the game for cloud nine they needed even more we are adrift once again been here on bot Lane Center and across the border 80 karrie soon as we have seen so far in 11.2 it's been cracking Slayer it's been attack speed scaling setting for attack bees killing overall got a lot better there is more beneficial interactive practice there cuz you're cute will give you one of the stacks and a outstanding it is a competitive build as far as you're concerned and it's the one that the pros are using I don't think you have to go but you certainly can and it's fine also really really don't like changes to the to the wind up there since the attack speed is going to help him and got that you know slight buff as well let's take a look at the starts though we did a flapper swapping over you drop your ward you can see this up in the river topside just over the pixel brush to see if there is any sort of variation in closers path going aggressively swapping over to the sweeper is pretty important for your early on because he's definitely one of the Champions that does like doing the full power clear into tank as we saw last time around it swapping over to sweeper gives you the conference make sure you're not over first drink at Ward if the if your lane or hasn't tracked it ideally they can they can alert you to hold present if you haven't been swapping over there laying as much but it it's it's definitely a champion like we do really does like using flash for Gangster Leon because you have such a strong farming fallback pattern but it is a doran's shield Vulcan invent is this the rats are getting the spectral sickle out there so probably not going to stay or something after all it's going to be in a baby amount of money or something but they are just getting her ass down generation for not last hitting that was one of the more significant even though we have still been seeing it primarily a t carry you spawn more of the souls from Minions that you that you do not last it and you get more gold out of them 1203 right now they're after all we're not done we have to go potty stop and go away from bladder gets away from her eyes good to see that one coming I think he may come over the wall and so that was on Reflux really want to be bottom side because she not supposed to go to the trip they do there is the risk of Lily starting topside and going down there that's nice passing by blabber even losing that much critically critically could have lost them all of the early game for clock on a flapper doesn't correctly flash that guys there that is just a complete collapse for them so very very good fight for him but you've been whittling down someday super heavily on the Loup Loup summer on keeping them in Lanes pressure Done Dirt our losses yes lobotomist the play last night before spoken The Flash out as well send her ass out from his van but clothes are going back in for the start of the map he's already gotten all the six Camp done right that's what you got there and is the tower. If they'll be getting done right here but it will be much safer recall on Focus I was just a consideration for cruggs but you know it's help or coming back from some date doesn't want to stick around too long meanwhile closer a very long time. On bottom side so it was canceled by blabber when you see the enemy jungler down bottom that teleport all the sudden doesn't mean that much he was previously re calling cuz he was worried about the reset from closer plus help from some day into defending their frogs but with the reveal down bottom you see on the mini-map fullkrug counter jungle there for this is the cost for foreclosure sticking around for the second interaction on bottom side of the map labber will correctly you microwave both those camps given the xtra-vision approve play by his bottom Lane and goes back to his own full clear so we are going to see an XP and gold leaf from Lab rats eat differently does in the jungle certainly you sense to always be able to himself the lead and it has to carry that into Cloud 9 mid game is over closer towards then he is just out of that would have been a kilt and everything but it looks like that skill shot instead of wave Dallas will catch up to you still got to be careful of round 2 in all this the control we're not going to be much of course wanted to get Vision with that one to see someone and the day was going to be much and there's just going to be the wave clear top side and bought Land staying alive is supposed to go back to the Jungle just because that is that is it should be a predicted Play Right Thurr you have bladder communicating oh hey we see the not reset from closer on the bottom side so I'm taking his full tops I can't be Scruggs and rapper Raptors if you don't see after the reset closer showing himself towards mid he has to be on his bottom side camps clearing his wolves into more bottom side pressure and they make that choice to fight but is not happen I get better way to you if he finds to spare just picking up a new kid in town freak fudge is the youngest player in the ALCS fully transformed over who he actually can't get away Cox and slow and throws up alot of damage dealt but can you waive dying to the tour de force looking was part of that chase down and so somebody heal for maybe a hundred or so of gold is love but it's not as bad as the Top Lane gig finally think the first time all series gives Cloud9 the first dragon and it's all in credits as Benadryl can they have played that bottom side without pressure so freaking well there's another look at the the top dive the mechanics are very easy to pull off so we don't have to restate those just route right there for Devante it to 100% certainty on your death for fudge he knows he's like a brother flash he's completely dead there that is truck cards that you have you know three people of Rel Rel warming up to the top side and what it means though he's going to be more important. Side Invasion 400 these clothes are get to take some camps back from bladder who had controlled full in come here for the jungle match up because of the top side Focus that closer it's been so much time there in efficiently you're trying to deny five nights bottomland they did get the flash out of vent and and Vulcan how to use his way earlier in the pressure but I still think big props to Cloud Nine's bottom line for avoiding disaster down there for absorbing so much pressure now it has started to surface in the nacs difference but Vulcan had been staying quite competitive in the first couple of drinks and it's only after that last big double wave was was denied to them that they really started to fall behind they're still getting a lot of value out of increase Soul generation down here sure they're getting overtime live with the jungle being a lead for bladder is a 1000 goalie 400 above what you normally get from the first blood in the assist so it is none of these winning in the farm game it showing even despite support Goulding come everything else going across money is a none of these pockets that's being answered by a dragon but probably still hunted these favorite hidden playing every mid-game better for the garden of the early game has been going so closer now getting the herald as well as box cutter was already on their side it's going to feel pretty comfortable you've got no one coming out of stopping just yet come out here and help make sure it's going to be safe you got something coming down to do the same and just her for good measure FBI we're on the way up to see that no one is answering and I got to go back to bottom line to grab their own wave they'll lose may be a minute or two unless you how much of a problem was going to pop that I
