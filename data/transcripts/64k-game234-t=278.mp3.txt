desired matchup driving right in Champions like to watch the bands come up for Phase 1 delete Draven hit in the band table will be interesting again to see how these ban phases evolve with a the swapping lineup so I do think that the Thalia band was in pots thrown at blabber jungle was it thing for a long time I'm so afraid of something like the Thalia Pantheon let me leave update progress painting about I would expect a higher likelihood of a kill bottom bottom land and things like that so I whenever you have a substitute player you look for more comfortable Champion I think the champion comfortability and the style of champagne is more important than what Lane you're inor whether you're Elena or jungler finishing out the band's phase Aralia Edge warranty for the side of origin sitting on the Pike in the Ravens still for cloud nine as they work out that third and final Fannin will be so the Connor is still available if I want to grab that one up Cloud 9 cuz then book to trade it for you need to pending a priority both teams have but it was very strong and the current meta Origin client guarantee both choosing to remove one of those global pick Champions that we know many teams have a favorite so far in this moment I am thinking a treetop if it happened or not I hear it I feel it still pressuring you know most played Champions he's got such a history on time can she was a really big fart even when he was in on TSM in North America take one of the biggest ones with the shorter range on the level 6 ultimate so you don't get quite as much Matt Mobility early on Fielding Hill and then the the Sun is going down to the bottom Lane you can still take the terror attack in your third ticket for phase one end because they're probably not going to let me know that's true right now you're kind of looking at it for Texas something, like we going to spend staring like to play on the regular season and they do have that option unless it is that Cobalt Lane job and Leona one of my favorite go-to and other things as well very powerful very simple Champion so that could even be something they give to bladder and bottom line is very real possibility something that you were buried alive stuff like between mid top and thought you weren't expected to be bought but in Big Spring or the soda and the players will fill the positions are listed in Traver will be piloting they are. Are they real sue the town of why I can't place it yesterday when Patrick played the Nico sorry I just keep thinking about being in the pot Lane and therefore attributing it to Patrick but as well as dear as a final band for Cloud 9 just do it origin origin like right now is a d or just something a little bit more I like the band coming up from Cloud 9 and XD I think it's just very strong and safe for crab is female to pick into a truck stop here now remember that rise is reworked on the turnpike you have some small changes made the song visibility is just yet the origin I'm decided they will look into Camille so I'm a little bit more of that carries in his stall he was walking about three strong early game Jungle by the ultimate Beto's where they actually going into the South Plains Al possibly in the jungle get the visit the sidelines with Camille and Nico are splitting a bit that wouldn't be the case here we've also had a lot of Camille midlane to sew in your lane matchups North America Challenger they have a lot of possible Camille midnight meal is an answer but it is in fact going to go into the midline but usually they primarily played it with a and they believe it to be true is what makes the pic strong listening they also value is the ultimate combined with Sona is very well give you a very powerful mini games by really good at getting a Camille's going early Camille mid cycle for store trays but the real threat comes from when your jungler is able to arrive by Camille hookshot means that is guaranteed engaged and with the change it to a man unless you get the kill those definitely are viable targets and go all in on and I think Sona Tom kench it's surprisingly strong but it came to still be about Lane at Conrad's while you're going to lose priority Canon D penny on Westfield you choose to do I think and also very the match it okay if I think it's possible. I think the biggest variability will be in the mid to burst into flames vs what will, and try to do in terms of answer was that the teams have loaded onto the rift so we're going to toss it out to the casters for the call thank you very much. We are here to witness origin vs. Cloud9 here in day 2 of Rift Rivals 2019 and we've got a roll of bills in and takes over mid top black horse play me Carrie subbing in as a traditional jungler instead of the atrox up against the Camille So getting counter picks in that matchup although he's running the night for a little bit extra trading power but I think it's going to be super important because when origin play this Camille mid it's not about beating you and laying or going for the one who won usually it's all about controlling the river and having Superior to vs. too well we're going to hear a word from cloud Nine's coach himself rib take it away thank you very much gentlemen I am joined by Reaper Reaper Victory on the horizon how's the team feel any looked all smiles on the stage it's been fun to a drafting with of lover and you know if we don't know what we are doing and how they know we are doing you know absolutely and what was the strategy that bottle and not really be just prepping what am I looking good and who you want good luck in the match up and bring it back to you guys to see how it goes and I will say I think it's actually pretty reasonable putting this Beyonce play style of something he can kind of get to and see that are basically G2 who who wants to play the shape he said yeah you do whatever you want just one more out of necessity then opportunity but it is what it is and who knows maybe we'll see five out of the winning bot Lane after the first time in several years and it might look good Superluv sneaky an amazing player but I had to make the joke all right well trading in the bottom lady as soon as I'm pants vs. silver, I do expect there to be winning this overall you can pretty reliably spell Fieldstone a Q and get Mana back for that keep looking really good damage to your I mean Patrick getting slapped oh yeah but she's mine has a manifold can get that's insane back-to-back games like this it was never about your HP bar is strictly about the mantis well yes and if you got a lot of good to lay down on for Patrick Patrick can sustain on through and it supposed to be relatively low on that manifold so I'll have to wait before you can throw out too many more updates boomerangs actually I'm not going to get into the zoo close to the trip but a nice and power Tuesday to get damaged his hat-trick putting him quite low Nicki almost done. Miffy pushed away though and we can kind of you just have to farm keep my zipper is essentially to get against Tom kench right now is so 18 to 9 is that scoreline I do that mental flip on the scoreboard are losing pressure on bottom light off and mid going very well because Ben Stern showed himself all the way down bottom in that River gives room for Cold Steel away these wraps are still has the shell crab in to camp on the topside at welcome to quite a Head of the Class can solve well doesn't take any sweet spots in from bladder size 7w backwards as well and as a decent trade Farm do pretty close to equal if we do have the players now swapped you can see the match up there as Midland first round is 40 closed Spencer and seeing what happened just yet early early TV Patrick does have frosting that's the important Powers bike to get to.. Items and now we say bling if I guess you can do back in teleport in as well, but don't Mana pool now it's basically just depending on the jungle pressure who's going to go to is nearest because it is very risky especially for camping like straightforward with her hookshot Realty Wong's in town that you really game was damaged there and I absolutely love this key Rush Executioner's calling first back that is the earliest who's I've literally ever seen in Pro play against double healer I love it I need to be very very effective it will help the trades a lot keep mind that this is a very poke be laying out like you always do this if you're playing like a liones of her kind of thing where you like trying to burst or all at once but you got poked her so constantly that you're going to make Headway through her W with that you're going to have the greatest wooden stick for 3 seconds which can sometimes affect the time catch thick skin if it takes down in time you'll get a couple of those pics have though a different lot of value their most impactful Persona is trying to smash that W key and waste a lot of her man afford those types of the same trait up in that matchup I do also think that it was a game has been relatively quiet so far this is once again a game that is going to sort explode around that level six Marcos because of the camile's ability to hit level six and then look for Rome plays around the map as opposed to very aggressive junglers Champions will be looking to get a little bit Scrappy come come you know five minutes in the game I'm still at the early jungle Ledo has gone the wreck site you mentioned earlier on Spencer and showed in bought Lena being seen the Raptors taken if not more so it is a good early start for cold a topping within 3 CS midlane within 2 bot Lane as a mention of course a small lead expected thing that you are against Sona overall means the game is slightly in Origins favor Leon and looking forward you know projecting 10 15 20 minutes into this game Who these team comps I think that on the side of C90 of a really strong team by both the ability to initiate with the movement speed of this, and the silver but also just reliable primary initiation with the Jarvan You lyric ending up on top of that as well just very straightforward how do you nine want to execute in the Spy versus spy words for origin they don't have that primary initiation tool yes Camille can go in but she's going to be a little bit more squishy than you go to will have to find it very good ultimate it's much harder to execute origin origin Spivey 5 when they are in an even number team fight and we are having cold reconnect to the game a little bit I was him who pause and he will be returning soon enough and will hopefully get everything sorted out quickly but that is what's going on right now and we get that all fixed up shouldn't be too big an issue and he's in his own jungle so we know nothing to really stop him regardless I think it'll be pretty big certainly we tend to see a Pinochle ending else similar for AP candidate is glacial augment Nico which is going to be kind of exciting as you're going to be like the double bit spooky ghost and glp build and and that will find Waze in anything that's how they look to start a fight if we don't have to fully commit with any spells or our bodies Camille throwing herself into The Fray and said they can use the key goes to get
