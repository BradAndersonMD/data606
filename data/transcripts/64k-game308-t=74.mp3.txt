is a tiebreaker vs. Vitality Genji's types of play ambition for at least one of the games they needed to check whether they had been rolling with the right line up I think it was a little bit of a failure and they have made the right choice and bringing in Bianca Jones law for that final game of World and even though Genji are eliminated they still hold the state of this group in their hand if they do VR ngrg must play a tiebreaker as you said was my pality for the right to join Top bait and what we do next day would be for the lck then to knock out or help knockout Yelp you'll never one as correct is locked in right away for me wow that is a bulb lamp pink I get spent all these support to disband off the table fitted wanted to make sure that they can get the next fast but you would imagine change the continent to take Philly do I make it Priority on the jumpinteresting out of RNA because I say we need to free up some meat and tell play in case we need to be able to get some more than rolling in this we've already highlighted how important let me in jail who have played in the series the ability to generate some of that might be dropped already damaged at 4 to hear the irelia grab them pretty early and and there really aren't any midlane bands a way in or more than us just a couple of jungle picks out so a lot of options here DemolitionRanch Yahoo want to punish does irelia is still available in the goes to take for Tuesday but when you draft in the threats you're getting yourself and orange tile that looking to go for killed they looking for Lane dominant and why you can Flex it a truck supposed and mid RNG I definitely coming in with a new more aggressive game plan on my way to go in the first phase key or baited breath around everyone watching he ran off as well as our weakest be with oranges third pick will be and it is going to be more Furley aggression towards 2018 debut on Olaf something that at level 16 challenge totally over a lot of a neutral objectives bomb to the symbol of rank as well I'm like a g is one of the Jungle is it has very creative pop something that doesn't normally take the ability to capitalize upon because he does just put the whole jungle on Farm but interested to see if he had something a little bit more aggression and Genji they drafted themselves reflux makes right now being able to get into the jungle irelia can go and support there's a lot of flexibility in the draft of the board get eliminated from the pool so you don't have that phone call side of them at the same time we can both to have especially given the fact that if it is irelia mid hey you can't even throw a truck into that match up if you want to get very spotty well the last regularly-scheduled game of this group is going to wait on the bus lanes Harry Potter ruler and Aries and I say it because they play with the Marksman in the world ruler probably the biggest carry for Genji and obviously the same for Royal and there's a lot left to grab here only diet and type it off the table and ruler wants to oppress early on Lucian is picked up thought you would have imagined that this will be the Lucian stand bought Lane Ford in the irelia will likely go talk in my eyes and I'm still waiting for that midlane pic but again so much flexibility in the Draft Virginia have gone for themselves RNG now you would imagine they'll look to continue with the aggression they've already drafted in the year of the game you can see lord of the Harvest that was going for that is going to be an exciting pick and certainly bring for us to see if men gets caught a little bit too far for words but you have so much kills rat hear of flash Play The Marshall Kansas jumping up and I Marshall boys I should stay in his keeping up and getting oakhills that is absolutely possible here we can have an incredibly explosive Autumn Lane and a lot of meat right now he's going to be around for of the bottling at 2:40 if you want to crush Suzy 3 level 5 Nami is stimulate Haru playing that to the other games Emma lachy on the Olaf Roula and 80 cars at trying to had questionable performances throughout this group stages ups and downs for sure is going to be going toe-to-toe with Uzi Lucian against Calista Genji that sank that final game they are here to play this is just going to be insanely exciting game Royal never give up the win will be the second team locked in the quarterfinals what happened Genji can force a tiebreaker for second and Genji throw it all out the way this will be their last game of World the defending world champions are knocked out in the group stage draw on their way out of it can hobble RNG and North America is Hope and call JJ with a pocket pic of the Nami could also deny the chance of that tie breaker for the first aid and just a cloud 9 2 walkthrough on the inverse of what I think it's many pundits would have thought would be the outcome of this group and we might be in South Korea but those are some R&G banners the Chinese fans always come through to see their teams play Live no matter where worlds are MSI or anything else is this is going to be exciting we are on the river Royal never give up the MSI Champions Genji the defending world champion and they're going to battle for us right now the last time these two teams met in the group stages it was a close back and forth ing start off with an entities Genji ultimate be a single m514 RNG listen to that crowd why do the lines so that he'll seek a lineup of Genji that Wells run has been cut short regardless of the outcome of this match I don't think many people would have foreseen this out, however this could be a blow to the LPL when I'm not getting the favorites for world the favorites of the LPL Adam Cruz in first place at this stage of the told him it would already be in upset and we could see them just bumped heads it's already spicy but three are coming down Main kind of Senses this he's going to be coming out for an election is only rented once it's not his on scuba instructor can you got some wings waiting for a bit more of its Bottom Now by show who walks away but RNC start the game 500 gold in the lead at what was supposed to be 8 orange and horribly wrong the fresh takes the brunt of the damage picks up his taxes and chases down to Genji members who they lose his flash orange golfers glad I'm with Gotti and they just wasn't the damage was no real Precious exhorted exerted on him not wanting to be Advantage early on in the chamber when you give it over to mxp the wild Cod RNG he can take over an early game and even for JJ's Wedding Bell but she gives away a lot of land controlled normally she's so good because you learned the heel and you bounced off your opponent's and ruler wins every trade for free instead the bubble does not pay off here in this little one arm flailing plus Guardian it's just such a fucken called both at level 1 is bre-x OnPoint mlxg starts the game Ride The crucial summon spells but got used 1/4 to Z that means the Harley could look for an early gank down tools the boss fight off the map he could look to try and help this Genji about laying into the game and you can get an advance as you can see him a hovering around off the clearing out his blue bus with no vision for the size of RNG Haruka turn this around but you have to be here the play because people still shots mess and I are relying on either a bubble or flake to get the party started and you were there at the same time as the Olaf so dank he's going to turn that I need to make sure the bacon is set first president what is already happened play Tequila comes through right now just gave 800 apart slowed a bit more orange than just the little one have you believe if you can see an extra Camp there for Emily she's in a full wave of farm lead for let me is the bot Lane is recalled out for Royal and he's back in with a control board in the longsword to help make sure he can keep that lean priority level threes all around the bottom Drive Midland holding equal and this is when he doesn't have time to spell he will be willing to go back in shop on train. It's already asleep when it was something like that yes she would even go back and grab pickaxe plus a credit card is a player that is willing to mix up the fields depending on what the state of the game currently looks like he knows that he hasn't got something to spell available. The longer he can spend out of that lane the more it could benefit in the long run 16 to the 1st to make a flight going to be spotted By The Sword as it comes up through this River and the control word now shuts off that vision and going to create some more scare in that Genji bought me what is a transport having a very good time and now I'm like she is doing what he can to reclaim some control of the butt side of an app that you can see that after the early Shenanigans the wind down and there was little to no vision we saw very early bass coming out from A to Z getting his Burley Idaho funk soul brother and and now you just get little across the river double control towards one more than the river wormwood on the blue bus and not a potential tank onto the flash goes to Z becomes a lot harder without a problem normally the Genji play style have been one of giving up very little and having Lain priority interet leads and see if they do get some gangster is Hard Knocks down a quick Spencer Nolan what's the next move is that Ward and many other start falling off and now it is gentian when Joyce darkness in this time but can like she feel safe with electronic control board back and maybe they'll be okay Yahoo also has a lot of control over the Middle Lane irelia doesn't have that level of way you could be able to match the sunroom you can just found a lot of her abilities very early on into the landing phase keep Crown underneath his power and I mean that he can move with if you meet this one for One More Time by The Substitute getting me involved early trying to generate a lady of good stuff back from an electric yes it is a one-for-one but Bruce of the you're putting Crown behind a note he's not running the cleanse in this matchup the same CC can come out very easily from out of town he isn't Nelly Champion in the setup is very clean but a good response from crab utilizing that ignites haven't taken advantage of the W-2 maximized is down and out enables him to go to return kill R&G still leads to kill school teams have so much faith in the LPL off of oranges if you because you saw that they were able tool rental control back of a river through the wards were able to once again make a good place for lack of vision for chinchillas able to generate this is an area that historically the lck lineups has Supreme in that vision control and I think that small glimpse is of the Brilliance of R&G like that he'll make them one of the favorites at this toilet regardless of the fact that falling down Oxford today certainly incredible team and our flight towards the strip episode has to push back mlxg and cuvaison his way down to earth to hear is let me hear to join in now Crown the first of reinforcement 323is show who joined into a blast go right back out but that gives members advantage to R&G they are controlled the middle age divided and conquered maybe as he has to go away troubles all said though it's really one for the Red Bluff and Harlow have to give away this control you have to believe and indeed I'm like she grabs it and is able to walk away surprised that you didn't have ultimate I guess you don't want to go toe-to-toe with another game Olaf for I know the game a truck so instead Genji did concede that are all the jungle and that slowly falling further and further behind a 1,000 gold he's not in the pockets of R & G & M electric heat looking to continue fresh air into Harvey Show me another point was the fact that so much of the area had already been working around the Hara was just running out of space to be able to generate significant damage you can see all the circles already placed around the right ba pay go again on the crown yeah they threatened that one but I'm not going to come through in the past in is the simple wave beer makes midlane + 11 CS stop playing Elmo stop 20 and its really grab this bit of farm he'll still be down 10 all is said and done Calista this is where I think oranges that are scary as because this time around they have legitimately three shooting threats on the map to the whole accelerated old can play that game and we'll see whether the Genji lineup can repel them well it's going to try for something at the very beginning get famous in the shower who just way through as it gets back out beginning of Damages are there is traffic going to take the recall now and maybe not ing right now waiting all across the board huge TS advance
