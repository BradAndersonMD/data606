I've been waiting for the entire go to see stats that back up and he had absolutely incredible rooms in the early game he got a lot of that early game going so it starts is on that level the recipes absolutely would be I like to hear Lucian band coming out pretty heavy targeting of hoody spam pool so far I wonder if we'll see the Ciroc a band I think it's worth taking if it's open yeah but I'll tell you this is also another one of those still a lot of Target and early which was a lot of big Power pick who are happy to entertain sprocket and stone O-Cedar willingness to lend support top Wing style he can fix it either one jungle experience was blocked on Tascam .32 I am using book for really fast farming jungers that can actually take advantage of this and reach the highest level of power even on patch 10.2 there was a game over in the lck with Pond Wildlife Experience phase power farm and Olaf and have a suraka UE power Olaf I teach you to run the game that's kind of what I'm wanting a team to do when I'm kind of excited to the first day of my calf this week has a chance to see those coming through Houston give me some so far this week set go through for some they has been Nerf is more or less mortal as a champion now still quite strong still worth playing and so play insta Bae says I want to the matchup I will carry them they said one games with obviously some of the things that I've been seeing out set in the program that make him a little bit more viable because a lot of people say oh just kind of broke like it's not going to be a big deal is people's adaptation to Alton carries out of fights do when someone tries to Die music for not trying to fit that amazing you know alt one guy in with full team type of thing would simply just peel is effective and also the W flash where you can get the tree damn sweet spot if you would spend your flash because you can use your flash passes a channel we're going to do is get your procedure off the game but it's one of the reasons I think that can remain viable is an accident. Someday here who has to look hairy for them earlier on the last week serious player to the end of the year where is Bedford MD complete garbage and Johnson what are the price point to your work and I really have combined for a lot of power over all Fortune definitely strong champion in the past but but still worth playing totally and we'll see if you know what the fact that I was just kind of trying to do a mental stock of which supports it ended up being banned with the Braun being taken out and knowing that they're up against Nautilus afelio still tons of kill pressure with his Misfortune Leona I think it's probably the right choice I'm glad we don't get to see the battery runs match up against Cody Simpson don't like you meet in an unfortunate with your against in the gates before it is like to risk you away from stuff but MF Hooksett. Cmdr the Twitter posting some of the designer where they at how would I tell people to find out if they haven't booked it I think right August is someone who had some bottled stuff actually hears about but it was just the mean Fest at the most ridiculous thoughts possible opportunity for us I would love to see more of the middle of orn because I think you can watch a lot of lanes and I also think this fits very well with the Olaf jungle till we haven't seen many Harry performances out of Grigg but he is trying to do so steer he can hard farm he can get an upgraded Black Cleaver and you can have this the rock of pumping him up into fights where if he just gets jungle enchant as well as Black Cleaver you can probably just kill Kodi time to filios when everyone have is do you want a battle at two teams tied for fourth place right now theme on the right hand side dignitas had a 3-0 start if I hate maybe they're real top performer of the drive to 3 the top team in the league right after they got to see Chanel stack up against hundreds by themselves for quite a while actually I think a lot of people had some fairly low some of them quite High 3 + 3 is not too good for the average performance I think there's a very good as well and that was previously the game turn it up and then the pecking order is defined throughout the weeks of the season right it's not the end of the world would it seem like Team Liquid starts at 2 and 5 but it's part of the process so both of these teams are in the midst of the process of trying to become great and both of them being a three and three it's just a great time to match up all right here we go Knight costume here to set up standing by Elton card take away buddy thank you very much I am here with pink card first question there is obviously the 03 that has been happening for dignitas what was going on in the minds this week to make sure that the team could end that just so we put effort into smuggling down and making sure that we've had really productive practice throughout the week and we performed really well in the latter stages still going to this game I think we're just really confident we know that if we play well we can be any team looks like you can take almost any fight with this composition what was the goal coming in this game when you got that in track just saw this Rocco Olaf of was showed in lck and pretty much the whole place can take anyone be one because the other straka with him so you just kind of play efficiently and just make sure that you're defending your space getting the place is first and like I said if we play well I know that we'll get the result we want think I thank you so much for the Insight gentleman take it away I like those lines do defend your space get there first and as long as you're there you can take any fight look for then you know if they can't ask him can control where were the old office and make sure they actually get control over that right now going to start with a solo blubaugh start and let his dueling get Lane control down there yeah yeah I'm always interested in following the jungles around but also in game form Happy's unconventional top laners like a suraka Aur Sona how do both teams decide to approach it as a something I'm trying to investigate a lot because I kind of have a theory that it's the next big thing in Halo or intro League of Legends like we seems to rock a dominate to move to Almost 100% band we'll see what ends up happening when it moves to other and check support think if we end up seeing more Sona the main question I'm trying to answer is you play around it or do you isolate and what's better for both teams that's often times I see I like the dinner talk to him isolated who plays elsewhere and then the hundred do you steam rice to like shut it down and kill it but I wonder if that's even the right call because if it's a supportive picking nature and you're putting your attention toward shutting down the support of pic are you not then just allowing the other teams carries to thrive right that's the question I'm trying to go through right now and I want to see what we do and how to do sex with corset be quick to buy start in the ground that level 3 in the ground on the top side of not very far from The Duo impressed with his early if you want to play a huge help Arlene Optical restart got a lot of hope for us Cody sun and you know when you're on the caliper several people leave that they did not going to trade with orthodontist jungle videos still have a full Camp to clear and affirm who's being a little brat Redbox right now maybe Tony doing a lot of folk on this Infantry genset yeah and one of the big differences between Soraka top and some of the other enchanter tops that you see like Sona is you're not actually building this report item on this one because you can generate enough Cs and have enough weight cleared just with your to spam I think the main strength of this pic actually lies envious being purchased that you run first it seems a little weird right to build the Seas against a physical damage top laner like set but the really isn't about the lane it's about generating the essenes charges later Andrea spending them throughout the process of a team fight because you have a very low cool down heel Likes to Rock It in W so but from the looks of it it doesn't look like there's much attention being spent up here and who needs is going to try and farm out as best we can to get sprayed himself a spot or the gun a lot of a car for now, he's not taking Berry or a lot of us Rockets do take Barry to try and dissuade the camp since you are vulnerable who needs pushed up and vulnerable no barrier what's your freaking get away from this one goes to the movies flash to the pole that gets the sun to punch has been running down worth with the flow afterward hop a wall in the way teleport coming in from Ryoma how do you had already been able to recall sweet but now he's going to be late in the Middle Lane that's holding the waif as who need to be back in the shop that there's a lot to unpack right there right there were able to get the kill but I mean afro has been roaming this whole time Houdini real played at the Dodge on Media Center Point Blank Q or The Mists depending on how you end up buying so much time show remember has teleport no barrier and the Q will end up stealing him over time so make something of a long way around really need to be able to land at Q get the controller and the Flash and if this too has time to return the house to him he actually lived through that one so practical II end up keeping him alive is there a route there ganado but doing okay over all this game is by the way tied in to kill coming through she's going to go first but if you count the assistant that believe yeah there was four set farming overall the whole lot 45 amp lead in the jungle going to pay for them a call that he and River fight all right here comes the orange horn hog hog knocked up as well but these cues are not Landing in the flask if Grandma waiting for the damaged walked out River control still going over to dig Aaron's Q by Greg there but I think the flash would have been burned regardless and I don't know probably lives in either case so look for a lot more of this if Jenny tossed enforce these plays go forever control use the push they have from the orange booties level sick now so wherever they fight you have to account for that ultimate typically even like in the bottom weight of Afro move tries to go for an all-in or even if hundreds of tragedy company have to think of that the rock salt in the back of their head by the mid size for most rushing in the way but is down farm for that was Coors beer apartment a few things back to the Top Lane to help the dive not happen but overall doing okay on the Rockets draft in Lincoln City out someday with his opposing Lane are pushed out does get to top the charts and medium ever active sure he's down his pants and she has a level 12 the video of the Xavier is frogging or support halfway but that is a TP on cool down now is mini splits in the Frog and loosen entire wave on the mid lane, shoves it and now they're going to fight by the upper level afro could go for the engage as well and as you said media has low for the dragon kind of plan B side across an entire plane wave to help control that dragon who's the better trade across the map do because roggen did lose the mid lane wave but somebody wants to talk to him because he walk down towards mid to kind of regretting the five-man play a lot of patients there showed bye-bye dignitas actually we're great decided not to all intermittent have numbers but you still managed to dissuade the play and he told me just gets very low there so now the frog is kind of return too late I wonder if 6 is started up yeah I don't think that anymore
