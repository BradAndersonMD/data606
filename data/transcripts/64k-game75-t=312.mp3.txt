booties with Envy powering up right you had like a thin a marksman you have no hyper carries actually boost up with a stolen, so I just think that he'd be in a really drafted for the yesterday and they got run over pretty hard shell so I will see if they can if they can make something look a little bit different here today because I I do agree honey have had much higher highs than Kumo of course if he hasn't left his career he can absolutely dominate in the Top Lane on his pics though I want to see him get a shot at doing that has game because I think the draft was a was a hard it's draft if you look at things that's leave the league in bot laners or most importantly damage share meaning of EG relies on bangs to be the damage Perry he's gives you his welder to give up for Success on him to be to carry and it put it on farming Centerplay with with wrong with a Karma with with supports kind of all across the floor and that was the comp I think this cough work because of the begin do that kind of performance go to who's Ariana is not that she and I think the draft was wrong for each I want to see if that kind of look and so I can I give him a pass because of things that the cop was bad and I want to see what I can do with this one here thank you can go if you want to go Priscilla Lane, you can go alongside super aggressive dominant Yonkers right like you can do it with great so you can do with Olaf like there was multiple ways there is to make those competitions work I don't think they went for any of them unfortunately for a Jeep but they do have bang back on a hard carry Skellington fighter Gear with you fellows very quick picks you're coming through from Cloud 9 it's kind of been a bit of their signature lately they seem to really quicklyUgg booties Rumble over his way A GPU know his is another pic that people really do know who need for but not going to be flying that against someone like licorice I do think it would be pretty ill-advised and liquor it hasn't been going through a lot of foreign lately either so I just don't see him really finding a kind of matchup that he might want to be able to bring that out right away on to act as birth of the split but obviously you very very strong Champion more black police enforce good as well and Zoe in her time and again more and more recently as the safe light pigment liner to round out your first set of 6 to build a bear can go either way so through that ends up going and Cloud 9 have to wait and figure out what their last week's going to be for the second phase of vana lot of headaches looking for dusty rose going to go yeah you know the blank is one of the things that people often talked about it being kind of dangerous for Zoe but obviously that band that previously so I could be too worried Stendra can be a pretty good one into the Zoe overall to such a state champion know when you are able to do the Palo Alto Urgent Care from anyway just back off and has keep your distance obviously a lot of food bility given with that mood speed increasing spell teeth are too pretty much always playing felt it feels like these days on the do it all so it doesn't even work Everly's play it at Freddy's offensively on the way of Licorice and he has really been liking Kate that as well as the Wukong and set are his most played I will see if they want to try to continue targeting some of those because you've been away from the more difficult for the GP event he does have more of a chance of actually kind of bring that in my Barclays come through bartash just saw that lane just the game of go into ketosis sign that nearly Lenny face but they certainly one of the game overall is after how to spell a barber for these Vulcans time to show this one Cloud 9 is leaving toppling for a laugh when people said they should have done against hundred when Papa maybe don't let Top Lane you know get the counter pick and Crush you as we saw with Sunday to Cloud9 taken that left this thing okay with what you got and he plays Rumble he plays set that was with Champions and we'll see if you bring something out like this one is the karma is gone as well the rumbles kind of mentioned what is it going to be as yes Alistair got a cool stuff on pulverize in pain for the blind pick you up Hoodie yeah what is it this is the first time we've seen it this flick I can't remember actually else are coming through it all and yeah checking on the campus of pics this is the first Alice are pick this split and it is going to be the rest of these are incredibly difficult to go up against that being said if you would stand it loosen often does fall off pretty hard at compared to somebody's going to jail but set would be much more of a say Fick looking more towards if you buy more towards those later stages of the game and that pussy feels relieved in can still pick on someone like U P worth noting that booty still has not picked up a win Xin Academy is it busy bee caves he just lose both of those eyes most play was The Rumble in to have a 75% win rate on that so your dad is going to buy that has been banned away but we'll see if you can pick up his first win on GP this split is a has always been Champion associated with him in one of the best players on it in the league for a for a long time I just like the Vulcan Lucian have her as their XT what's the world together last year and he's like hey Julio I think it was kind of in your career was playing Lucian against TSM yes you are that one goes I always I always enjoy that I like bringing back the old player stories old teammates old jokes about players on the seafood eat very very good Vulcan outstanding in his own right and going to be if I went to see EG yes a bad loss yesterday we know there still a fairly good team I'm expecting them to end this split on a positive when rape Cloud 9 they went 17-1 in the spring split they lost only one game in playoffs I don't see a reason why scene I cannot just keep that same record over here and summer 8 + 0 run to end out the split-pea they can do it here as we are on the ramp for a second game of the day I'm already way more excited for this easy game them I was for the one yesterday after the draft I think that they're playing worth of their strength GP is nice in that you know it gives junio where he can kind of a pop off and you can carry but it's also not something that requires your attention constantly knows it's not something that is a lane counter right it's it's more about the scaling and he can just kind of sat with Dan and try to play that up by himself spent here and it's going to keep more options as a result filtering that since she going PTA we have been seeing you no more kind of variety I think with some of the volibear that ruined some people going phase Rush some people going towards you know even like conqueror various things obviously more in the silver Lanes but PTA has been getting picked a less but it is still very very strong for the one do you want to get to lease in early I can make your traits really effective there and obviously is the added benefit of that bonus to damage coming through in team fights for your teammate so now we're going to see what the jungle starts look like it's bought size for both junglers leashless in both cases here is well worth noting that the nurse to Jungle full of DW only heels for half on Jungle camp and the other side of it is that his base attacks because that about 5% so we is a slower clear and a less healthy clear this is been pretty substantial volibear jungle probably still his best role but brought down a fair bit of liquor straight to it he doesn't easterly damage the grass still goes on but it is actually afelius playing lethal Tempo that is is really quite uncommon these days I feel like conquerors by far the most common and even after that the PTA is is I think a little bit more common Del Sol more for a kind of a late game room here it doesn't give you that much benefit in in the lane itself but you can sometimes uses a sprocket off a spell and then try to push in the wave he added attack speed and maybe that's the strategy here from Bank looking last actually interacted more just keep that shove or you poked with a cue properly Tempo and then just hard push the wave be careful the fourth level, Dallas-Fort can be threatening Hazel could always go to bed before Verizon to with Aftershock you wrote back on the Alfred that point so then into the wave comes back pops the guardian Spence Karen I think might know what level should be up to see him coming through as leverage was the other way around and this is hilarious. Right bottom jungle where is he where is he I know he come get my T-Mobile iPad so it should be a double shuttle for fence Garrett pushing up in the midline to so that is is the benefit here energy does kind of get escorted out is that room from goldenglue is rewarded by having that settle on both sides in a nap and they know that booty is really the only one have to be worried about a gank eventually right now. So he can try to play a little bit around that and so far so good for people Geniuses right you got pushing in most cases who knee is bleeding just fine of his licorice licorice pick up pretty early recall to grab refillable in cloth armor we should make his Lane pretty comfortable who wants to wait till Gene if it all possible which is really close to him right now 3 call comes through and should be comfortable just going to knock down waves at that point that she doesn't go all the way it looks like he was afraid of what he had a man in his lungs hurt but Mana rabiee play Christian Few Good Hits are the Bears going to land not really do any party at 1/2 HP with Lady face starts not not the worse though at least because he did get it and okay trade back on Blue course I thought I could have been a lot worse than it actually was actually had a burial place behind him where he was keeping into which licorice couldn't really run past to kill us so that allows you to threaten a t z Trail Chainz I think that's kind of wood to sueded licorice a little bit from pushing forward so that's a nice horse out there from who need to have that in place and make sure that Ray didn't go to too poorly but is is falling behind in farming evidence that is somewhat expected to be pressured in we'll see how much is he going to pick up at is torrid Outlet not really pushing down since I control Ward was able to make it look for the cake but ultimately nothing happening on the Cloud 9 side very very small Fiesta episode presented. But they so basically just betting zero Matt Ladyface I've never gotten for a play this man could have negative and region labeled be any different yeah I mean honestly if it's pretty dangerous to go in as All Star against these Tetra Lane in a pretty little three you're not going to try to engage at all you really do need all three spells and that you didn't post that there's so much slowing between the ass and this bar that if you go forward and it's not like an instant kill or something you're trying to retreat out of their Alastair doesn't really have a lot of ability to actually escaped he's going to be looking for this wrong now since we could be engaged on a is Russia's lose feed those look what a Flash and wrist that nisky still actually the east of it down so just give it only it'll flash or cleanse get away but they don't wanna breathe cooldowns didn't take a nap and knock him down still control Ward and give three to Gold over the Golden glue who is up three Bs in this Lane you look at how EG putting in STL yesterday glue as a result has the worst average goal difference at 10th in the league at -1000 at 10 minutes he got absolutely slammed by Jensen yesterday this Lane I was he doing a whole lot better and some of that you can give him a pass on regardless EG play the fairly close game Cloud 9 up and gold over although very slightly as it's a big top lately for licorice that we're really dance from uni will take us out whatsoever but this key is here I think you're pretty dead no matter what he has orange is black licorice he's on top of the birth of punched the old man is going to be afraid killed the very least Golden Globe you know takes one for the team if he pees in house. Is an auto away from Taxi Cab Place follow your heart break if I ever get away their you think he will come back in and kill off puni puni should have just counted His blessings that he didn't die of the way than compact actually Farm it up instead that who need my settings the Killer Instinct he's going for more and it's going to cause me to lose to Ace probably losing a fair bit of this one he already lost a full wave at furlough is extra chasing over 959 do end up as a result still coming out ahead on that play but there was a lot of hesitation on that. I've honestly it felt like they really kind of work sure if they wanted to still go through with it once the Alton was dropped when she became through you know what you really just want to start the day off with licorice Alton him into the wall by half of men you have a guaranteed Q the sun everything falls up the ultimate from cintra but they just text so many purchase know from licorice you're walking over it and no one was really starting it up so it just felt like there was split cons or something there from Cloud 9 but then who he has a child life are passive the flashes in for it but the Steve Garvey really came back up there for blauer giving him enough help to get over the wall and to come back into the execute weiand a kind of setup for the easy CC out of licorice it allows that kill to come through a furnace get the very start of it also I think it's more Miss play there for him and the day though fairly close game difference not absurd but I got to say for the back at the split Cloud9 they were totally down 1500 Sport in the game it's a routine Part 9 definitely but this is a this is also that the aftermath of it is so not only did junio verse Jason not going to kill he lost muscle weighs and guess what happens when the way it means it pushes away from you your jugular is now not on the top side there jungler is the wave is Frozen on you so you're going to lose a lot more minions off of it but I just had that first two ways that he actually lost a minis are going to be tonight to the Tower and licorice Kansas Tennessee freeze this will see if he wants to push for some reason but I would say you just hold it with your jugular up on this topside and soon he just actually it is Tony tried to push this
