I want to see better me jungle Synergy between just yell at last name that we saw from them yet we still for the week off on holistic did nothing in the early game acceptable to have season 3 and then for JJ's what time that was example of like I need to see the better team work out of the guys I really want to see to do date at the counter picks on red sign here in ASL mean that again and spend scam player on that sweet we are into Champion Select and we will be taking you through this job I'd ask you what you want to see but you already told me earlier that you wanted to send a band and we got ityeah down for that do you me Banos interesting in the case that it's more of a scaling pick at the moment but if she thinks they're going to be going late I'm not going to fall tonight I think I also need something is the orange it was I have abandoned in game 1 early in game 2 and up and and Game 3 it feels like we're still trying to figure out where to land on that but I think I can see how it makes more sense since they've relied on it so much and they're winds that if they maybe want to sneak one of those bushes farm and scale kind of when it's not allowed in this time the Affiliates will be B6 the band come through and that burst bey's and Varys of highest priority here for Team Liquid so likely in doublelist hands they are there indexing into their Superstar I think this could be a back-to-basics RAV4 TL dates and a lot of them at ades Bears Tom kench can be locked WD Sentinel I just don't know what to eat Ireland meet at this point Baris we'll win most match of the victim has not much you can do here for you she want the night at the music that's all I'm going to lose my faith has never been one for the Laney face he's about getting out of it BG all right quick couple lock-ins their Brom and mordekaiser for Team Liquid I think I'd like some mordekaiser so not not not the Ezreal or the MF how does that lame play out it was the kind of utility Marksman medal that you saw it on of this matchup I think even the same for you more range supports like diarrhea and stuff running around back in but ashes range lets her actually at the auto Advantage anvar so he has a little bit of this is a flying matchup usually for rash second phase of bands coming through first off the table will be recognized or some jungle targets here trying to knock broxah off-kilter a little bit so I think they know Genesis probably not playing physical damage midliner so they're going to just ban out as the ones of rock that is more likely to have a strong ganking impact on maybe Jarvan will come here and if they want to lease in or just a lease in here but maybe they think you won't be able to perform to follow so 1 Jungle 1 mid coming from Evil Geniuses Crumbs are you expecting that mordekaiser to go top link yeah I think you usually takes out with you like to send your man by EG ask him if they're going to Blind LeBlanc yeah I think the old block bench should go here right otherwise otherwise it would be a lot in scrims what is a smock I think the LeBlanc insta pic but leave could be a good denial basic do the best jungle juice and then what are you getting him to what then we're cuz I do. I've lost in his Jarvan Olaf said you wanting just wanting him and you want to give to do kid the account it's a Mark wanted to see what actually counters LeBlanc with Sandra off the table though yeah it just hasn't been played by either these guys all split so with a drop the table I can't run loves it so so good really taking their time do you like Lori on and play it's a LeBlanc just doesn't make sense for them here for Carrie there is it does go there and now what will be the response for gesu k he's got the reply is like the most the absolute most signature pick for him so he will pick that up and we'll have to see if that jungle mid do all that we've called out will actually step up to the plate for either team really I think that would be the challenge here spends Karen and just UK versus broxah and Jensen with the team comps locked in where do you guys fall on the chances of either of these teams EG yeah I like you leasing LeBlanc I think can do so much you're letting I think you can really let them have their way in the early to mid especially when you have Ashton level 6 you can do a ton in that 3 V 3 I can also CTL just having a massive feeling bandage so if that. Like if they're LeBlanc Lisa and doesn't pop off early I feel like TL what kind of have it saying that what my I want to see how easy it was more admit jungle Synergy this is the game to basically proved that you're that you may win condition you can stop most people in it and then you basically punch your ticket for playoffs almost if you can pick out someone up here cuz they're one of the team's truck flying to get in so this is a great statement game for easy if they can ride for both of these squads it looks like they've got what they want to see if they can pilot it to victory for crumbs he's looking for that aggressive early-mid jungle do a 40G to take down TLC Ellie got to hold on and play it into the lake and we are going to head to a quick 5-minute competitive Integrity break as as explained before we're taking this 5 minutes to allow the game to play ahead to make sure that we preserve any competitive Integrity issues to will see you on the other side of that five for the game hello everyone welcome back to the LCS IMDb preacher Lee the man across from me is Isaac as they are coming Bentley and we have LCS to play here today I'm excited to be back in Action spend you like for me yeah it's so nice to have I'll see us back some normalcy in our lives going on here amidst all this chaos and it's really important game 4 playoffs here yeah vs EG you'll need to win every like the three of their necks for at least they still have Cloud 9 coming up next week which is going to be a really tough one and if you're painting that has an expected loss they have to win every other game yeah I had our stats team put together a sort of predicted win-loss I Know Jack did his individual game predictions I had that's about to do the same thing and based on just would have eloped predictions TL ends the season at 7 and 11 in seventh place outside of playoff contention down the other side Emoji would go 10 and 8 going through in one overall Team Liquid results Wayzata showed us they are not a top-six team in the LCS they are 4 and 4 with Roxanne in the lineup you even dislike don't include his first week with jet lag they're still only three and three with him and that means they really do need to step up and have a better result of the end of the season with four games to go they really do it's this weird thing with TL because are the four-time champion back-to-back-to-back-to-back and kind of stuck in this world where it's like are you looking at what we expected from mammoths are and what we have seen from the past and saying okay they could still do it based off at or you looking purely at what they have shown us or this what because what they have shown us for this split has not been impressive what if they can get back to the Forum that they've had over the last 2 years and really start to work with process and of course everyone is possible before Roe is even possible as we've seen tons of those weeks over the past two years from Teen Wolf well we'll see if they've got what it takes for them being Evil Geniuses have been honestly a complete the light in how the edge of their season has gone 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 run that. He loved had in the last several weeks but it CG sitting at 7 wins their expected schedule is fairly easy stop but puts them as a 10 and 18 TL for being one of those expected winds based on Ehlo here and one of the other great performers here is just do cake who is a second place in First Blood league-wide behind only Dart off and went 8-1 and 14 last week but now I've got to get coming to the topside Spence hearing loss of turn that racket down a little bit again except the top side impact going to be slow and I believe is one difference he's going to let us an easy sonic wave as well first Blood Evil Genius is off to a great start and then make it look really easy getting a flash at impact taking him down very good start on that topside atrox looking to get ahead and in the middle and he does have the minion Advantage so just do cake cannot read too long this way but find a hold a bit of a breeze here in force Jensen to stick around on low mana and health and he's going to be a bit of a dangerous spot with Spence Karen in the area so process will come over try to help him safely reset this way if this is the barrier tax in a lot of cases you can still do this even if you do have teleported but if you do you know if you are stuck in a spot where your latest like this in your jugular can't come over often times you can take the reset then burn CT and get back in the lineup not a big problem with beer you are completely beholden to actually have and just the fact that Trundle show to make sure there was no gank means he was able to push that way valve but otherwise no one's been scaring his Top Lane that seems very easy to own one in most cases without having a good way out do you want to plan a milestone thank you for the Sir Arthur doublelift is a single kill away from 1500 regular season LCS skills I expect he'll get one at some point in this game somewhere down the line it's going to happen to watch out for that one you would hope that you would get one in this game kill or 4 Marksman play are at generally having a pretty bad game if you don't even pick up a single kill as a marksman who tend to get at least a couple I mean about seeing people who are getting kills I also want to give a lot of athletes Jensen here who I think it's actually been having one of his very best seasons he's got by far the best landing stats he has roughly as few days so I guess I facing the least depth of any Midland or in the league roughly type of pobelter who has even played all the games he's played all the games for first place as far as like least debt to your Jensen has been having an amazing year in the midline 40 yell one of his vast and remembers hearing from him back around the week to he was saying that he felt like he was doing everything that he could he was putting his best effort you was having a good season and it was frustrating that it wasn't enough for him I know to yell fans are a little bit sad about that I would love to see him turn around I'm not just saying this that teal pants can be sad and you know till like you know celebrate the downfall of TL I would love to see them back on top form Jensen is on top 4 Min the rest of team is going to keep up to this level I would say a lot of it has been about issues the team play issues in these things at times you're watching the individual player and send their looking okay it doesn't seem like that's a big issue is beautiful Ward hop in and that's going to be an ice pick up there but should be a trade is Brock to bring down the I smell it it's the one for an overall but it does mean that they slow walk back to Lima Jensen had to go Summoners I was just a great place soon as you took a hit 6 Jensen did not yet have level six there when he actually died so I couldn't turn around with the ultimate just now hit 6 afterwards and unfortunate for him is going to actually die with the way pushing to him thankfully though he has the S quite well so he's not going to be that far behind despite actually losing some of this in braxas way up in farmed Over Fence Karen will have the earlier level 6 got to pick up some of that midlane farm and you can see now this game state is 400 gold a part of the penis is having a pretty good start for your overall the elf not an incredibly great leading team just across the board they've I think with their jungles us everything else has had some really rough early games with sadistically this is not very far from average prevent and it's still been a decent record despite several early games that you can see yet but a lot of things are very very close of zi'tah plane is up at the river down to Jensen and yeah I think it brought that didn't actually block that though dented may have died and now the boss Thai 2 V 2 fight on free heavily EG favor Dash is a very strong later and despite the fact that we haven't seen much of her this year I do think it is a champion that can match up quite well against Bears yes she is very very good. Buster Lee recently as well better attack reset on cue things like this I want to point out very very like almost Pixel Perfect moves the right to yell core barely got in front of the arrow put the shield up took the stun he still could have block damage Republic but the fact of the matter is you still would rather
