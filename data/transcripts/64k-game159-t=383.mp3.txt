baby eye color affect be so as work if those responsibilities will be kind of solely on Alton what are the stars of the team and and I'm kind of curious need to fill that role here as well take them band is that a lot of surprises here with the likes of Rumble akali band away if it was always gone if it has been the most highly prized regular worldwide so far this fast and not a shock to see that one dropped out either that you're looking for toppling counterpick you're trying to ban away from the state picks up their horn really does have such a stall laning phase quite a strong leader and skills can probably well into later to the game I'm afraid very powerful Viper we'd know at his best what country is Dominic Gary Player in the LPS doKadabra Evolution left on the table have right now by Immortals but I've been getting played another reason to look for something else values this pain and we doesn't has basically always played as the 80 Carey it's like 90 10 down there yes we can see if taking over a family of a solution doesn't get from here to talking a little bit more about play if it looking for really really well for supporting those types of 1Tamar Braxton for cowardice and try to extend van leaves like leaves a bit later pretty early on here as well for guess you can speak has to be a top but it's for off in the Middle Lane of here as well so very early on I mean that was the question be honest I suppose was you know how to commit 2B fit into a roster with more question marks than statements and he says I think Mark was thinking if he's going to be solid all-round is at the Psychedelic experience a blicky got the check is already wouldn't be surprised Steve moriana hear a lot of people do like that match up in the Casio is considered a fairly good one in the lady face or orianna and how are people still comfortable on that champion Victor another good matchup and another one that is really in the Wheelhouse of power of evil I think it was kind of outrage and poke down the Casio utilizing the Freddy how old are the rest of these big Tira devil eyeswhat was the potato most likely it is going to be Cassiopeia mid who can borrow as you're saying but you do always have to come and give the respect of these and come it does make it very very dangerous to know if Casio work to go up in that Top Lane lease in Leslie Camille post office 6 is pretty much doomed for Casio doesn't have really to remove what kind of get away and it ate most of those games I have found a better flyquest what else they can respect here from the Mortal side looks like the guy was laughing like that one in and dragged ass off the jungle table here so pretty standard Jungle Band beate Phillies gragas with the least is taken awayyeah do a couple of AP junglers have been banned out we have the least we have to drag us those taken off the table Rex I still available at my guess of where Mortals might go it is barely strong or League anchor but he is very comfortable and good matchup into the lease in so that's kind of where I'm at doing Immortals will look to how to look there for some time ketchup and Away we'll see flashes - 1 Pinnacle sportflics but they're going to replace a very very exciting stuff here the blitzcrank pretty spicy a lot of players do enjoy this pic into these other folks doing that kind of wind up an animation before those Bobcat utility fairly local economy Bilbo support items and things like that on utility when it comes to those device in the last eight trucks and Cavs vs which role that I doubt is going to happen here and we never going to see what the final picks going to be fly plus Noah's Ark is a chart to top whey liquid web for Mordecai and Viper going to bring a CFA Islamic ribbon did bring fly by spinner number of when it is left open he's going to go for that aggressive matchup he has strong early you support here from the lease in and he does have the penultimate crossmap squats do for any sort of Dives or any aggressive won't be one plays the back to be pretty big and black was on that bottom kind of has to say hi Temple acid and leave because when you start to lose control the map when you lose vision control becomes very ineffective you know your full name could be off the hook in the ones that your man right here, right here pay here on Saturday for 4 days of play today or tomorrow and on Monday here as well while Turtle longtime LPS that are a very big but you got on your team. POA who loves resource on that Victor I do like it's worth noting this is going to be a Lucian bits and pieces ignite press the attack Lucian mid so they did want to avoid that Cassio into Victor match up with can be quite difficult and I could hear could be looking very very aggressive power of evil does pick the phase Rush it's actually really helpful against trundle ganks because tunnels closed you down with that Feller and if you can practice aids rash have a much better chance of just kind of waiting out back and getting away is purple has no heart CC CEO Tricia I'm here Trisha what you guys are starting to go green initiative where I believe for every Victory you're going to plant 100 trees that could be 1800 trees in a split are you ready for that hell yeah tell me a little bit about what sparked this initiative and why it's important for flyquest want to showcase greatness and we believe everyone has greatness within them and we want to help facilitate way to do that are go green initiative it says my everybody to help save our planet and one of the coolest things I think is coming out from flyquest is the flower in the floral spring jerseys who was the inspiration from that and does the flowers have any significance absolutely so we're doing a few things that you can Bona is Japanese flower arrangements that's how you say it and our Jersey represents nature and nature is you know beautiful it is graceful but it also has strengthened that's going to be your inspiration for 5 months this year and we want everyone to remember to appreciate nature and have gratitude every time you see the flowers thank you so much and best of luck to you in a team cuz I want to see some trees planted back to you guys but you're on the way and we are in a game I personally and play Crib for the LCS itself and thank you very much baby of course for sure as well as you get a broken sword vs. Viper push you away at the very beginning or actually going for a long story 3 plot start here so may want to play a little bit aggressive has a lot of staying here in these really leveled with that three health potions in I dedicate to know when we could watch vipers ribbon earlier on last year at tended to be run the 60-minute mark you'd really come on lines are taking over games big swing to get like double kills of all combos and stuff so I'm personally talked to him at least expect like a 20ft is leading the first 10 minutes of your life was playing pretty defensive on this bottoms by here early on weekends he isn't wearing his bearing down on his bottom side and it looks like he went to work as we have to re-buy she going to get knocked up in time but it's still a CSF it down there there is to be a week from power of evil in him she had the extra potions remaining an extra charge on the crafting potion now she two extra charges as well as that's it and so is heavily in the event is there and they're looking for potential form and I've hear here comes the plague victim in the front pillar comes by 40 peas that was pushing out they get more gold out of it here also however you will have fun going to be picked up support brace for absolutely nothing and I'll check his on the porch that is huge Altec anaika the two main carries wrapping kills your early on for Mortals you're at the time one more time very well time out Immortals bot Lane is level 350 coming down here a little free IQ level for plastic in picking up that first Blood a great book from ignore to actually trade back in Viper committing for here does try to go in for the kill by chocolate still have the flash available and they're able to catch power of evil you just kind of walking back on a dangerous route he walked over that word was five he has my phone down there was no way out for him and that pillar looks so weird push it back a little bit Wright III v a minute later but you know what credit to him I want to give some slack Rafi we do had flash burned after the fight could have flashed Let's Get Away. The recall on the midline we go with a 1,000 gold lead for immortals is PP was not for nothing he did get a kill so so as that's have helped or Advantage which could be Immortals looks to make a dragon play and on that box out of the map I think that could be present intelligent they have already seen the bottom Lane pretty heavily and now you have a big Siesta vintage year for all that and he got the kill which allows them early to your by so he could have tons of Mana to be able to actually push up and it seems as fresh we should open up and early now I'm dragon look so go ahead and try to protect Turtle to him backwards goes in a straight line no thicker off there still Gold Leaf or Immortals look like basically everywhere you're seeing CS leads in literally every single light except for Jungle Missy look at it and they have plenty of time to dance playlist rate for you eat it look a lot of fun there for the backwards good colon damage but the truth is far. Both those players going to walk away still adjust me some Farm as lost as many minutes were picked up for no gold Frontier seat cover act will be pushed out though is lead a little bit of ice dare to try to get I got a bit of Cs but it's slow so he's going to have to back off and see some of his farm over to thin or who is it be closing in on level six and made it look to make an appearance of this flash available when leasing does got that ultimate he could try to make something happen set up the mafia Vice solution skin enjoy the Nyan scheme of that one is Father's Day question no problem it's cool to see all take back in this is what I came for changes on the fee for the last 2 years or so with league is the non-emergency hotline as about later mostly myself I really do like seeing all the extra Scamp he's out there and I'm glad that I'll text her everyday view the LPS is half of it to you like we see purchase receipt apps do it they didn't go Bartlett I'll play Madden 12 and I think that's kind of like a battle pass little bit but you still see lots of Jocelyn Castillo in solo queue that is played fairly frequently you also still see some I'm her down there and Sanctuary how to fix a minion not going to find a re-engage by forget the way for the bolt back though it's so as this forcing Old South horse looking to buy some face at Turin Warehouse just get away and it's just good cover for me so I can reset the way to get to save face here not going to be losing anything from that and Viper because he was why would he has no teleport he's actually going to lose that wave up on the top side in it a little bit pricey stand for on Spring Street towards bought but perhaps worried about the jungle
