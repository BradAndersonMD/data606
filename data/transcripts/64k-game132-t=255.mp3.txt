LCS jungler of all time high for a second in trophies with Pearson another fun fact from the game show earlier today we had a test question where they pulled the audience most underrated player in all of the LPS and they got the most votes wins but I think you call him the second best player of all time and actually candidates that surrounds so I see that actually probably feels in here or I am here unless I have a plan for attacking it I do think of a more balancedfactory reset bypass for the Olympics is left up already left up there if they're going to grab Diana stuck people in set up she fights for a failure can be really big part this building around this Champion people who has Lain Fades and getting him either, can program and that is important to know because they are the champions does not have to Festus of its own you need a support with defenses to supplement dog but I also like the offensive mind when you're around a bilious and you want to play off your big flamethrower place be able to get infernum individualwell water damage to be there for a CO up there the Midland on syndrome models grab very early on have seen some Nautilus mid that was grabbed over in Europe just couple days ago but has been locked in we do know that's not support a truck picked up the topside I was old and bottom for any sort of a fellow Aquarius also comes the big I do like the Nautilus looking for hoes trying to remain proactive also point-and-click set up for Sandra later on in the gameImmortals here setting up a side post has revealed already though so it does mean that we will get a counter picks for cold and flu I still got those go back and forth for the first it's in Centerville go to The Mortals die I do wonder if there is a small chance I don't think it's the case cuz I don't think he's the best wrestler Nautilus don't come through if you guys better take him to Better Built like a deer for cold and flu so he actually gets his pick of the litter by Giada for this late for the LPS and maybe some fries Lycoming o-320 should be in almost every chance collection dispatch through the think she's probably the best tank jungler and maybe the today to yeah and if you don't I mean the block can do it but go to the hospital high that the central player has so many offices Where is the Love Lock Bridge in draft games being able to get those deals very easily in lane and being able to you'll have the pad a lot more often as far as he fighting that we played the big part of it if I am a blah sticker my biggest worries are always pointed click for later on in the game because a lot of guys to go for those you'll poke APA style place to go for a big amount of first right now so it's at least you know for his benefit there's no point in life where they can easily La Cordon Bleu doubt if he does he'll become a problem gets the most early Kelsey's acknowledgement out of the car for a while and let you get back to safety with a good time Panic sit waiting in the wings as well yeah so as long as I will say is Tom has not been exciting pick was the looking at right choice and will continue to be a player one of his better games here today goes. It's only a single game behind Immortals just on the scale edge of flat Fitzsimmons early in the top-six have you heard talk to us saying it take to fill a top for top 5 team got to make sure they're early game looks good on the got to go to the latest if I can do it here all right it actually I think them being closer on stage Ronnie is a bit it's a little bit of a relief not the biggest early move maker she does combo will with aatrox though I do like this energy is a chocks is often able to set up in gauges in Lane whenever the atrox needs and if so which one is right behind them then you stacked up your son's even quicker pause and fortunately and as always with pause in the game I like to say things that aren't terribly important everyone just get in the game as I'm passing the LSAT are and I'll check but a quick tutorial on saying his screen name French doesn't have accidents syllables like the English word emphasis you say m Harding to the rest of the letters French everything is very flat so you say if I lease a car and that's a part of screen and he did confirm that even though I hear so many of his teammates calling and Micah do you like a lot of us have done in the past to but we will remain consistent Aika will be pronounced correctly free kids Akins up Princeton little bit of your French lessons what's up I pulled you to decide because I'm wondering what was the reasoning behind putting Apollo in here today I'll take about like it's reality hasn't been playing for like a whole year comes back another pressure has been taking it out we talked to in the past like all the last 20 years ago and make it sound very confident in saying and I felt like it was good to try these synergies why we in the Smith Springs pay to see how well we can freak you know it looks energy for the team quality God wants what's impressive Apple a good we can be using all 10 players in just another need a 5 o clock to you in the team back to you guys well Apollo already earning them a gold lead Linda Ward kill beautiful big difference bottom as everyone else Apollo is nicest guy in the ALCS if you don't know that now you do and there's a certain the offseason when people work on a Shopkins what seems to be on and you know clutch went away and all that I need to get off to me it's okay to take one let go get a starting spot I'm okay on Academy and Indian taco gotta start about me LPS deposit okay Academy life and now he's back back with his that sounds a bit aggressive but they're hanging out together yet again stop playing fighting Hans was losing Health hits tow us back I like it the spider game play-by-play yep that's it I noticed they didn't actually completely engaged but yeah that is a big hero again we mentioned such a whiny free things restaurant around the entire patch a lot of matchups for Leon can get pretty good job trying to move in especially with Lanes pushing up and does get the red box deal Aker nice little trade your on the golden glue with the sun and when you have jungles Supremacy as such a big Dimension to the LeBlanc syndrome a ship where they're syndra gets you really ditch out that punishment rather than having to be worried about all right do I have to respect this LeBlanc change that much and the Distortion combo because there's going to be a drunk or as well but you got to fold with the Red Bluff invade not only does Xfinity do it away but you ensure that a kid can actually bully more heavily in the mid lane so far so good Immortals looking through a little bit small farm leads the most matchups there is the bottles got to go see Smith as well as everything they can about war does a he is Depakote and topside freshlook juking the brush but that's a nice pic of what they know all right interesting closers actually going to wrap around from where Smith he's just came from but could be too late we called us complete Grayson Gary Goldenberg Gilmer of all the Guardians cannot stop the recall when is that a man is going to take his own recall back in but I could have managed back is closer to let you know I'm overtaken will get back on track CS go to the driving was and knows he can coach Camp play it all comes from when you point out revealing himself walking over at midlane xmithie there does mean that closer can find the counter Farm basically monster though has to back off now like hard-nosed that said that the garbage popsike is as far as food was triggered it it hit the ward Forever at all and froze do they know he was topside please play offensively nice Ferrell changes play by so as trade back missed every skill shot Hunter the only kind of Jefferson way up in thinking that I'm probably be killed by now meanwhile go to go skating at the store do you buy tit W get some slow down here as well as chains on top as long as I can track he's still here with the route for the damaged if it quite there and cleanse was there regardless of the flash down to health park on acre in face yeah definitely it's it's the flash flood and also a big chunk of damage what are the things that you needed it quickly as possible especially as mid laner when people come in for trades like that on on you if you're going to have to bring your class anyway Burnet early so you don't also take the damage and are also forced into this recall because look right now it's mini wave gets pushed in your summer spell is still gone either way but you can't stay there. On even more for the slow they could get you follow whatever and that's the flash wait for her answer and they can't get it arranged in a can of Smithy cute so early is it away with the flash out got the idea they're obviously when flashing in for the slow as you're trying to get a flash out first then you follow but Indian Summoner spells traded say so there are points of attack year for both sides in different so Elaine not there with no flash topside could be a repeat visit it's 50 does need to get to level 5 first I think first before returning Brussels fall a little bit further behind in Farmington toxin that has access to the ultimate at 8 Doc's is very capable at fighting you off if you continue to spam gangs if you're too low level Shane's found just back to Taco came to Rome the middle and make sure they can stay safe babe is pushed in Gold even come by as well but he will once again walk by a board seat cuz this is aggressive towards useful comes over 3 on 3 down here find sunglass little slow but not to a device right all right big difference is going to be how they rotate into the river for the shuttlecraft I think that's golden Guardians should be able to retain it no flash remember on a Quran the syndra so his positioning is so important to go to who's got his eyes on him feel comfortable as well without getting your body needs to get one of scuttle no real titles and if it's something really incredible and that doesn't happen as those bought the movement tacos back in the bottom Lane and the garbage is taken under control. Now it's drinks go over golden Guardians feeling pretty comfortable here the game tied in Gold overall frequent 7 his overall in Mount Drake on their credit another recall heerfordt syndrome another trip back to base they give up the objective and let another wave push course it's right here look at that Cannon denied so as to pick whatever the Top Lane their kill I want 100 that's damaged going to lose a toe 100hp needs getaway very deceptive I think that is a Kill Ya trying to slow maybe another q in their know you might find the next girl shot of the day it's so I won't be down no damage dealt it doesn't even up to Somers post there where I can had been forced into several recalls pretty early on due to having no flash see if that will actually turn it around for himself still has the cleanse ready for stage 1A ultimate as a closer and expect they are both fairly close to that level six point trying to get a little bit more access to the CC now go to Guardians pushing slightly in the bottom side small farm leave as soon as it gets me grab his concert pics and look up the top side so it's getting counterpick on this one the Gangplank looking very good in his face rockso
