this is outside optimal lineup so just going to have to run around you know we call a Subaru in Australia that 35 year olds play football maybe so but why am I from twice as productive if they don't win the series but I was given the opportunity to take you are going to pull out the crazy takes the crazy strategies this is where the fuck is your moment right that's also very interesting to see what had been choosing a lot betteror the tank would certainly fit in his wheelhouse and I'm just curious what his answer is going to be or he's going to go back towards his legendary coffee and try to neutralize this way it will be ultimately decided by a bottom line cuz why not to take something like a gangplank right and be able to add utility do I match up the Gangplank talked to playing to Renekton but limit the ability to be able to give me an option to be able to fly through every now heading to secondary phase of Van Dyke SKT to put the pinch on their stay here with his champion pool particularly doing 80 junglers because he is already lookingdid AP bit later with that rice or something like a Zoloft maybe even do not turn it to been locked in for both teams has that people right now but diversify damage portfolio is a great case to be made right now given the fact that you're going to have the hottest CT coming out of the jungle on classes line up there probably Lane fine into a ride and ride doesn't have a dash to be able to get himself out of Harm's Way and we've seen how much damage does Champion tattooing States has a matchups I think it was going to be played atKendra and 1/2 musli ran away with a gangsta cover pic in that jungle there he does want to go towards something like you do off and it's more so about finding the matchup for the Renekton surprised that you sent a good match up one of these best champion in the least bitI need to be honest I kind of would expect to see that one coming through at all times he's very very cool as there is going to come through that we have seen as your top as well as expected give them good priority and pushing we've already talked about the long-range being able to take someone a little bit more chill right also the fact that it's one of those Champions that tells the cattle go to the options the kind that has in the early stages famous for saying that he will not play this game until he feels like he is back in form of when the state was created so I think that that is certainly something I do not expect that's why you don't do when he was playing in the elf DLC also didn't play it when you returned vltk Martha is one of those players that is so incredibly proud of the lineage that that Samsung white line up had you know some still date play the river pigeon control at that will Champion shipping from Malta you know that's a lot to I'd be very surprised to see it International wins you just off a quarter past the big 100 the next closest player toothaker I believe we will be at 55 no longer at the tournament and then behind him somewhere in the 40s or guys like perks that is how dominant figure has been 02 International results but the games are played for a reason and I'm curious what gets played in this one skinwise and how it comes out cuz there's something telling about that every once in awhile it looks like oh it is I don't want to wear this until like I feel like I'm deserving of that level of skill again that's just such a great call out this is going to be a really special moment for League of Legends fan because he's also crucial towards a composition I want to see the coordination with clit engagements in League of Legends honestly legendary do us any North American fans about when he played on R&G at MSI in the amount of backline. On the alista he's just always being one of those highlight-reel players go back at Worlds at Katy no shock there either he's pushed back a little bit but, then again looking to the flip side across from splice they've been so hungry for so long to get ready to talk to you and Thursday in particular have been denied so many world births before so this summer on on the wreck site and the or the counter match of that we were talking about into Renekton I don't say counter mashup making sure you don't buy Renekton repeatedly as she has had a massive Target on his back this entire series and I do like to talk himself up with that access to minions in can get so I'm quite easily said a lot of heavy trading however it is going to be the right side that is much closer to the Lane one of the reasons you can do this when you're playing at the right side is does need level Fraser really be able to impact good gang names that tunnel to be able to get into I don't expect anything to come up here until he has completely steer applicants will be on a timer we talked about this all the time now we see it's about 4:30 for 35 with us second rotation cruggs which means on the next rotation of crowd if Colin is press forward, and needs to respect the fact that Thursday will be on play the map and potentially look for a bank around the five-minute window on top but I think that's because I will start to bounce back to work and obviously if you could High to pay Advantage as Khan looks like he does he's been through all the corrupting What charges a from Chachi meet the teacher be able to control that maybe set up a meeting for eighth from South and deny that if I ever took the potion said he himself actually as well as they could be pushing around and tries to be nice and farm from humanoid there's anybody in the wings though the gangster mid lane quite interested in fact Mayweather flash flash flash to mid-length have a look at the jungle impact still being available spaces something like it's gonna snow at Lee going to be in favor of them has a really important when do we were just talking about the balance for top-line but also for Mid laner particular why she doesn't get to really love you take it and how strong he can be with his spoke with his his way for so like ganking azir before level 5 we're really his way up there just because uncontrollable on that first back then you can try to slow down how much does a zero can take over the game and really protect his jungle because he always has Midland priority so that was the one window or splice got it yeah it didn't mean to kill but they need to follow up and try to abuse the fact that we should just have to, priority for a bit and has to respect not playing with lash the wave is pushing towards bake or so we can let people can needs to charge me to last out of the turret a very deep self off of that can be spotted by the sky is blue this time around though he can still see the truck camper when it comes up in about 30 seconds and play around that 4 minutes a five-minute window so he's going to get eyes on it you can also see that played popping in making sure he's checking for vision to Concan continue to play aggressive up in that top died and I'm really interested in the fact that twice played MIss Raven Lane has a weak-side they just using it as a slow scaling answer they say Draven if you don't dive and he's going to just be able to farm pretty freely in this Lane going to continue to build a few sacks and we will get him a kill in the mid game and then he's going to be able to take over don't like they throwing additional resources down to Teddy I do want to point out the brilliant thing that are observers just showed us hear the fact that they're safe sweeper but missed both of these crucial Ward so this is something that when reviewing the tape again that pay teens will have to be aware of where they are fleeting their Ward because it's not usually where you would expect it to be a sweeper Mystic very well done from fac on Division ways to be put in the beginnings of a glacial shroud coming through for the orange trying to survive on a tour if you can see at NCS different claim with graphs you can out of the turret there but it's an early lead for calling up there is it takes another look at Aspire take that one over humanoid going to keep his word of life that's good that's a long cool down 10 gold given over Vision lost and play it across the control word has a lot of a jungle and a lot of this game is going to come down to how long can SKT can maintain this vision control continue to farm and get to Walters item Palace by because I do feel like it can be a fairly active early game from splice you know you have things like the rise rexha I called both rise as well as something like the naughty list and also set up really strong gangs and if you stop defense Spells at level six. You can't really look for those pamphlets as well we tell the boys coming through from people like Joshy so I do think that would be very content with the pace of the game right now you know obviously would love to be able to pick up the first infernal Dragon of the game when you're running black as if it is just such an attractive prize but don't feel like they will be in such a rush to be able to go to that one that we expect kind of the big explosion point on this map to be around the bot Lane because they are playing for such a crucial objective so we're waiting for the level 6 is to come in and he teleports to be available Chachi using his just get back with the land there's no window Works SKT could try to abuse the teleport decent clear protectant where is he doesn't feel like I do like her Showbiz did it's not just like oh well it's not going to take it fits good for lunch bites which one you think it take so long fights would like to use the full like 10-15 seconds of shojin Bob Evans comes off and kill the guy that way so she with with anti-tank play hold on. Grinch you're coming through too much damage and first finger and Katie from the priority that Congress had all game long on the top side it gives him ROM priority the ability to First be the person to move and yeah humanoid helps with his Midland priority secure that infernal but because he was over the infernal Faker than built up a slow crash the way fraction to the wave and it gave so much time to SKT just walk in with skarner nekton should have been able to try for one wave and then allowed to regain control of mid-length with humanoid that wasn't the case it was a rush play you can say that lid now has access to that helped by Jaco my look for what they should throw you over this. I'm going to go for a starter the primary target Delano campus party will affect our place and surpassing apple is halfway to start to grow Elite glass with perfect binding shut it down punishment having a place outside let's take another look at this one is available on this life I had none from f82 they would both use on that midlane drive against humanoid once again it was a greedy overrated and Chachi
