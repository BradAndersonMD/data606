blue side of the chance for WECT changes for flyquest Iran blue side already right out of the gate yet they are going to start targeting bang I think bang and Zanesville is one of the best parts of EG and they showed that they can dispense can completely focused on Hootie and work off of the top side of the map thing as basil will be just fine on the bottom side they're really intelligent about how he manages minion wave we mentioned slow push last time I got a big bounce back and have a nice recall and so Calista off the board again for them never going to let Bank in his hands on that one but it looks like everything else shouldn't be availableyeah they're time there is a are really disgusting the chance to like to set this time around there were by the way we've been seeing very very frequently from them it's okay that first pic that's a bit much let's not let's and foreign play that one you know we can maybe Fork Caitlin on the one side but then you've got full of air on the other foot been torn down a little bit off the exterior jungle baby or baby figure out there to try to remove dominant laners and allow that pic to work on contestants now with Caitlin off the table is it okay is ityeah and honestly I would rather have the 80 Carey without how much they do carry pool has been whittled down with the with the extra nurser come in for 4:00 1016 ashurst and so strong especially with a wild throw even though in the last game did not get as many of the arrows as we have three ways he has been really good on a car there are some decent chance you can work out what I can work out well against ask people but not too bad now 6 to go for a highly prized Wrangler to your in Graves they want to keep since they're not heavy far that means a polar bear will easily go to Santo and without much pressure see if he's going to pick something out there for themselves they say what can it be I don't mind Alice Cooper's they look very good at it it looks fine to engage for the team which I think he zhi do want they tend to find themselves always playing in the teeth fight announcer death notices every night sleep by number right now I don't hate it either cuz O Bar got nerves to look very strong champion and it's time to take down this may well be the lock it and maybe okay so I was going to say put leaving put out the the Azrael there but if we have the time can't think it's a little bit less likely but I've been scared being on the graves gives him the possibilities especially early on of attacking santorin that's one of the things that the death was calling for a lot of people kind of looking at does rely on their laners as we saw on the last game goldenglue getting pushes allowing him to get the shuttlecraft and allowing eat beef to get the doubles shuttlecraft opening as being a big part of it right now flyquest eat themselves if there's pick junk was a matched up ATK one side support on the other wouldn't be surprised to see a fresh or something else a little bit defensive Turtle safe against somebody possible time to come through this Papi G certainly do love to dive bars to be pick up though he's early. Golden Sun on spin of Tom kench we can do that one again only problem is there going to be snow this week Falls so these sent a Synergy is not quite as strong without as many men did not give me to the golden glue really only who need to be a Freightliner really really. I've been on the team if they go with that they could try split push strategy good definitely very risky but they're on right side right they've got guaranteed counter Pick 4 if they actually wanted to do something like the Quinn like we got him hovering over last time is available on red side you can force like what to do everything first that being said I kind of do like send it whenever you have Graves on your team to ever they they spread armor for each other you have a lot of damage coming from your jugular the ultimate from Senate also from from bottom Lane even earlier in the game is is quite nice and some of those dual and I'm expecting spend are due to try and utilize the painted pin it's kind of early on a grape is actually one of my favorite Champions get to volunteer because you can Dash away from the W from the East slope as well as using smoke bomb to really mess up a lot of other bears and gate when you take away that vision is greatly all the bands of the top light taking out almost all the Looney Champions that we think of Rumble still available and Vatican right now she has very very bad engage right so I can't really do it and the graves can't really do it if you play orianna there's no ball delivery on this TV to pick up is more physical than magic that will fit knock down a couple of pegs and then what will do it when it happens and you're bringing up fall Delivery Systems CEO for orianna combos I also always look for Shen Delivery Systems because defensive Schultz are are so much more relaxed when you have really have a young male a champion to dive in there I don't really have a good deal dive in their Champion yes in the early game and made game you can use Graves super aggressively to counter jungle and it really helps to have a vent on your back bill to me like dollar rate that but later on but I don't know if they're going to be able to have the same sort of white glue generally will play more rain JP carries to hasn't been the one to take up the Assassins permit all right well Jason going to be the lock in here for the topside and out for the first time you're on Evil Geniuses and this is going to be to have a lot of horsepower you have Global being tired. Length and the top and an EEG can at least two other side the map flyquest have a more standard looking team composition my eyes are drawn by someone putting more effort and more resources into the swamp Rose free Golden Globes long history from Cloud 9 this is going to be them trying to place to / offensively because both of the sidelines are more support if you have Senna ultimate so I can come through to help you out with those to be to Shin Stand United Chene and low block is one of the most devastating in Ocilla Lane combinations and it turns your Midland into a very scary area for the Oriana cuz the block get those initiations gets those no-good Shannon spots so easily with the multiple distortions that she can pull off so this is an interesting look for EG people. When when you're stopping and goldenglue and Kumo you're taking the aggressiveness aggressiveness of your team out of the middle and now they're putting it back in with Champion Select I want to see if he can do it because all of the questions work is his lamp going to work honestly the regular-season win rate was higher with Azucar in Kubo the best later on EG so far this year has been cool if you look at the player of the game standings for Evil Genius is the leader in play the game to zukey over there. Subbed out 10 games in like there is a lot that can tell you the EG maybe was better with the other line up with after 10 games they brought this group and they stuck with it through plastic fight 202 start said no it is still these guys this is our lineup is the Players we believe in and I'll see if I can do it here in game four because it didn't game free all right yet again every single game is a must-win game before EEG the pressure doesn't let up until they're done with the reverse sweep you have to complete the entire thing pushing it to a game 5 year would be big for them because I mean this is double elimination but dropping down to the lower bracket is already pretty scary as we seen at the end of the split a lot of the lower teams have been a lot better showings and big upsets already TSM the higher-seeded team was I think three wins above golden Guardians in the regular season and Golden Gardens 300 EGR not three wins above hundred thieves and if they can't win both X Games are going to face them next up right here in and yes that is scary there is no qualifier gone at the end of summer is a new look here in the LCS spring split plaster not impact it is only how summer split playoffs go if you not make top 3 you are not going to Worlds your season is over goodbye I tried your very best in EG yeah if they if they lose the series it was on Abby's they finished 7/8 goodbye they are done that kind of what's in front of them if they can't turn things around I like the strap I think this, and totally work I think this can be very good for them but the question is can they make it work at the end of the day it could be fun to watch for the Block it's a lot on him yeah I'm super excited see if they can actually step up to what they've drafted here with the game play cuz you have to follow through on what you said out for yourself in the early game yes it does require the shed on the top side you'll get it to your level sick before you really get the full benefit and start to go for it for those inmates but already out of the gate you can go for level 1 try and get some fish and olives to set up the graves for for better jungle tracking or for invading early on Grey's with Red Bluff is terrifying you know at the early stages especially if you are mid lane match Isla block orianna orianna requires a couple of levels more points to get into W before she gets control of the minion wave a little bit easier she's much more scaling LeBlanc right out of that can set up gang super easily with Distortion chains easy defensive order here by svenskeren start the recall about 4550 switch out to sweep her off you go and it's a nice way to start things out if you want to go for a defensive jungle opening just do that were sent over here to do when your own silicon Valley's hard invade get the voice down exactly get the most out of your trinkets spot meanwhile it looks like it is going to be both bottom side start in there I thought they were actually going to add some extra damage to the to the graves clear but they're just going to start in Lane a little bit delayed the reason they're doing this they don't want to give away the opening or expense can cuz we get engraved could you start red you can go for a lot of possibilities and it kind of makes the other jungler keep that in their mind for a little bit more expensive wood that's going right now taking biscuit 0 damage fight the blubaugh can heal up against it no big problem but full of air is I can't behead right now got the really heavy leash feeling really good about going red to Raptors the knocking out whole thing out that late a straight back and forth is Pua and gold going for a trading pattern runewright matching electrocutes that when I fight comes through he can hit him back with qrow stay alive and then keep your health bar is Flowing pretty recently as my shopping done when there is 2 CC in the pattern and you know to run away from things like Graves Escape fuel pressure looks like level 2 is going to be at almost the exact same time around like a nice little cutie from banks in the angle they're right through Thursday so it's a little tag the little things in your trading in Lane when you're trying to get some damage back on on things like bar the can he's so annoying when you're running at me like support like that I'm going to be another one most likely going to get slowed float again attacked for the soul deep the damage their thing walks away almost as done they still making sure he walks to the right enough that if bardar Lanes a queue it won't go into a wall and no problem there easy walk away very small early gold lead to fly Quest I will say it's been 21 Camp ahead be the fact that a leash is really helpful for that one he's going to be in position in time for the Scuttle whereas since you're doing a full clear instead and ignoring those River camps that it will be in the total can't count will be close to tie-dye size that theory not getting rid of Auto tax to get the electric off having a good time right now products that they are both on 60 amps are you know he just got caught crab so you immediately need to get bottom crab and since you guys going to do that while the recalls going off we can get there slightly ahead of the volibear if you have to run all the way from topside rather than recalling them running from base but it is pretty close on the timing and if you're a little bit slow with you can definitely get punished so loud here kind of laying around does have the face rest so should be able to get off the recall was trying to go to the cookies how far is The Flash followed us here can't ignore is blocking the Autotext skillshots route on a car won't matter either and that TV remote approval not anything done he is out of lame eBay please some Farm but there will not be any kill those extra few seconds Spence Karen opting to run down from drugs rather than a re calling for the first purchase then heading to Scuttle crab actually make a difference cuz he is able to finish the Scuttle crab
