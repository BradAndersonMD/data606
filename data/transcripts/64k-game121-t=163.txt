when i were an putting the onus on the players in the situation of talk about the scenarios that has meant kevin's lack i gained three it's our turn to take a j. a slight so will be walking us through this one is yeah first of all bands of the table but jack germond you by c. l. playoff hopes his diary even in the two oh we get that you've new know there are still likely to end up in a time regress that's for sure and because of what's happened the first two games and the theoretical possibility of sixties getting tied at nine nine is still open field hill who is this one and a flight risk when

trucks and it's everything is where the vincent's or insley said is really good of the grounds that here now voice the events and sent me i personally better for them to earth this morning by yes they have options said friday that event may bellies now on the one never gonzo figuring that the peace in this matter fung said to give the and have a very solid team for flight west and guarantees that later team by over the lead if you hit me again if you even find anything to the interviews where that he's troubled hillard janelle hughes says something that he lives or enough evidence of that saved from little bit if as much with security related personally but i would like to see some elude warned us about it that would just yell is all early it you're basically it is tear alyssa is the lead right side what i think that trundled might have a hard time getting keep up the control of the data about the rednecks is selected had trouble they believe the real you have a c. r. leslie val once we get into the game itself up by a high the way like we said again both these teams in the village and put together to all or as promised mention maybe every all weekend including a tie breakers sneak in the playoffs and offended their championship on the flip side fly quest to al one point was being touted as the you know the true contender cloud nine has a struggle recently brought so low

and unsavory break i i love this place innocent she'll games had healed yet just the that there's a chance to pay those clouds at the wedding forceful tomorrow is just too much every game isn't thrall and halle berry and you throwing game is five minutes away we are heading to back and integrity break but having a delight to james leach back here in five minutes the game number three seed that thing that path what happened and fund did beth what and and a a an end run and a thump up the thump thump thump thump thump of thump thump thump thump thump up of who and who have bad kind love thorpe hand hopkins of that of thud as of of of thanks to that thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump thump are now how are ours but at the hello everyone welcome back to the show lcs this year i'm glad we got alongside the guy that white oak lake yes directly into the hell up the idea that has correctly good job of that you as a good start with the traits that so yeah i mean a saturday obviously bob we are in the last week of the ellsberg uzis and we're no closer to knowing which team is made in the playoffs because up almost every day they could have done so far could've walked a team in or out of playoffs lot and i'm gonna away yet so we still don't know that mean it's it's pretty crazy that weird this foreign and only one team has a lot of elixir slowly going to be kind all on his or a kind of walked out if you're playing first bar to the bottom we still don't even know second place rape as a response teams out nine winds and now hundred visas or the
