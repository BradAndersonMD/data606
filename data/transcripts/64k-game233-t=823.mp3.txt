as we heard from the flag last coach though they think they can actually take advantage of him being new onto the team Austin X it does take a while for the jugular to really coordinate well especially in the early game with the leaner so far though take out a realtor irelia here what's a z r what I do want to point out as we go through this and that we are still on patch 9.12 and other we don't have the bands in the spring or car are the other two bands hear Center, Pandora back on Fox 1 final band for them it will continue on forward but as I said 9.12 to the patch for now as we have this overlay back in because the band once again next week will be 913 my understanding was that was not to allow the fumes were starting to be disadvantaged coming in the next week and never got to scream G2 and fnatic & Co and not lose any time with that so much like it and that means sidhwani pretty much a hundred percent presents I believe so band out once again not any sort of at Target Banning there or you meet is left up in exchange for the atrox Bustelo probably going to try and take this one this could be a Mike young pic though definitely has played it in the jungle that's going to be tonight Highway Silver plus you owe me a very coming botland combo and that was going to be gone if they want to live in Champion for hot gold Luxe is still available if you want to grab before the second band phase and now it's like Western dude want to grab Israel does goes Super well with you means to have a very safe a hypo damage Lane you can also do things more aggressively like the Lucian try and get in there loosens pretty good since forever regardless combo Justice cells during the open up from their Corky probably the Midland so magic damage beer already picked up for Playa Quest physical damage range carry on crowd control Midland often brings back before he does not directly engage think either with the ultimate you can have three hits mares but generally feels like it's going to they're going to need some sort of Frontline here you know what is basically the only school so far from so they might have viper on the top side and bring something with a little bit more ccrp an initiator Autos is great for starting things up for a fox shocks needs is something to actually start the fight and then it's such a big deal with you all getting recess and silver speed the case here we maybe see some like beerus or even asked would be weird but would be engaged the bottom line for Turtles Bibles look like what does put through or Viper is indeed on a tank here really popular in could have been a possibility here for Phoenix either way if I could it need a jongleur base for a charge is going to drag his band is decent Nautilus almost certainly is 244 hot to go out here we're seeing still a Tijeras band away from wild turtle there's the other dimensional Partners list for you to be taken down I mean I have seen some people do Caitlin with it just for are super annoying a bushing early Lane Caitlin can put them under Tower and then you can fire off constant harassment Longview to place a good model of Swift long as you can track the opposing Jungle of the Dragon release both gone there was a need a lot of magic damage jungle option fourth Magic Image from Store Phoenix as a result from Powhatan popular various place in the world not a crazy town of North America but also a good kick if you are worried about magic damage your composition I do like things every mind there you go with the charge for with silver they've got a very heavy dive composition hair super speed boots. Let's all and everyone just charges in it to try and take down flag play the game plan for Echo Fox a very clear from Champion Select we shall see what the answer here from flyquest is are they going to get Viper some sort of split or they going to actually try and bring a little bit more consistently for their team fight this is going to be locked in at this point that's almost assuredly a top laner here and I was supposed to get another. AP unreliable engaged though is all that you have to try to get a plane can you have to land the rest before they flashed away is dial be locked in a long time it's a wild turtle is the physical damage on this roster that will scale well but there's really no tank on the team's yeah they're relying on pure damage and some stunts from Kenan and Rex die and that is going to be the game plan seems like this do need to get early advantages and keep up the pressure on those turrets Phoenix bringing back the Cassiopeia he reverses Porky and end this again. How hard it is for Blacklist to engage got to be a love's not getting jumped on throwing my ass after you run a few composition of Ken and Rec side so this feels like a good pic of based on opposing team magic damage anyway we have seen Phoenix put on some great Casio games before and I look at the boxes draft all right there sitting up to with Mike Young on a very powerful early-game Champion here in the Olaf what 2 + 1 games with Academy when that deal don't have to worry about the knock UPS could be very very strong Mike Young's debut back in the LCS last we saw him on this stage was with TS them but they famously had a disappointing previous year after dropping him at got a lot better but let's see what happens now going forward I'm getting ready to go onto stage go fees you told me to reverse that they are faced from 2019 summer so far I think it's possible do these teams do look very good they both paid mine again but what do you delete your recent addition to black bus was finally eligible last week for they did last week of regular-season back to play two weeks ago didn't pick up winds but I still think they're very good player and it will be for momentum ever fly Quest meccafox hoping that would Mike young they can do this and we are on around for the last game of the first round robin of LCS 2019 summer all right I should initially also be on the Olaf ear Mite yeah you definitely have a strong invade for Echo Fox but it could try and get a zebra War down themes of spreading out just to look for defense of vision at the moment but you definitely always have to worry about that possibility looks like we had a little bit of exchange and do belter + what deed come out with a little damage dealt to Phoenix keeps around the brush no one's in there and just find a jump around and press that you back and forth 11 Gold for that spell thieves prox for what do you eat on Phoenix as well so a little bit of extra change meanwhile we might have a delayed and they try to utilize that Olaf names like what leading the way q but not going to get away by running for Jack to the wild turtle hold his nerve and aggressive towards spotted out by flight question now do know the 10:00 Central be spotted when he does his Raptors all right let's see if the bottom side actually fake leashes for santorin or if they just show in lane and let echo-fox know they start on the top side looks like they are delaying a little bit not using any any extra man on the Red Bluff or anything though so should be fairly well aware Center starting the Wolves though never understand not on a bus right away but just make sure he's completely unseen the very first game of the game cuz he knows that no one. This far down once I see him on the street towards though if he does go to Raptors they will if they check know exactly path you have taken by grabbing one camp out of off on it it looks like you managed to bypass the whole thing so santorin pretty wisely gets around the jungle house getting spotted they can guess that it was supposed to read but they don't know for sure yeah that's what's a big things yes the Deep Ward was put down by Echo Fox turtle is there and they saw the location of that warts of santorin working around known information are not trying to give over location yet and that opens up possibilities for making a move on the bottom side of the map that's like the more common we would have been like blue to drop to you to look at topside so theoretically still has to play safe knowing that they never saw a Raptor Center is at bottom sides maybe he's up there an early on in the atrox can a match of it does make the a fox has two speeds some CS early on Viber you can see a little bit of harassment down onto solo slowly pushing the wave into the turret can try to get some early damage a lot of the early Canon Power does come from some very damaged and trying to get money off plates and we can get right here it is going to be doing even as much rest as possible for the landing phase Ron but this wave going to crash pretty soon and sadly for them it won't be with a jungle in here by its and let them get there faster if it's possible that you can crash with the wave but I'm usually pretty tight guys going to do the full clear power clear on Olaf pretty common get the level for extremely quick and you also get the benefit of responding your Camp extremely quickly so you can try and get to that level six point thank him now slipping into the river and we does the Santorum pick up the Scuttle crab change a little bit of you a little bit of knowledge at the rec size on top but still has to swing under Tower anyway I don't believe Mike was founded by these got to walk him over so technically the Olaf wasn't spotted that you do definitely no sense for when to stop swaddling walk back of the Jungle south side of that and yeah he's going to be just fine point assorted you mentioned Kobe bought land is shoved it looks like really almost nothing is denied any gas will go over the lane matchups year for flyquest they want to have these early pushing Lanes a lot of this game does hinge on he knows been getting a lot of extra advantages with the wreck site coming through to try and support some of these they really need to try and get the information on Mike Young's where about is that Olaf can turn everything around on one of these overextended solo Lanes especially yeah cuz they are and you chased them down forever even flashes built-in floaties probably still die and he's gone back for an early red might as well so even with the time spent to recall my son basement level on Farm overall against Centaurus and wants to make his own recall very soon and it's so far been treading water across these two jugglers and if we look at the Keystone Seas chosen to Mike down with the Conqueror is looking to be more of the carry style jongleur right sometimes Osceola Osco for predator for those big impact logangster snowball Lane but with the Conqueror you can actually stacked up extremely quickly this is what Top Lane Olaf players take Taco going for a gank right now though he knows valkyrae always get away from the anchor Taco doesn't even passed it right there that was a bit I guess lucky that since when was totaled in in nearby the champion get away. Just came up with propane there he actually is able to see the controller for hot glue sticks around to defend his placement for a little bit then throw in the summer I feel safe and without new timer has gone we are finding drop this one out like young now knowing that recognize me wrong side of Mac it's time to put a quick drink at Ward down up for that crop in the black white and there's no one of my guests were talking about for the New Orleans trying to do I have an impact bits to get time to do is just hit that with the axe not Landing there's no going to be had Real by they talked a little room to ensure that he can get the cannon mini last hit there at least I guess without some extra harassment from the Kenan who is starting doran's blade but definitely expect a Viper twit least go half and half as far as the AP trying to bring a little bit more of that snow for the later stages of the game I'm playing a game for example you play blade on it is actually always wrong if you build it for losing match if you lose your matches anyway why not build a better team fighting item in his GoPro do belts haha and have them and have the better team fiber car has been kind of compelling idea and I'm kind of curious now watching through the games that Europe has better topping his overall and so usually good advice if it's winter and I will see if he actually takes that advice Santo are going to stick around for Scuttle crab number to as it does spawn here what's so far so good for the farming got a fairly calm early game between the squad wild turtle and would need getting some folk out big fight. Revival to get to the cyst it's just a trait of cool guns do damage going back and forth like that they can both feel really comfortable as life accuse pushing guys think that ultimate trade super Advanced stages for fiber here you might not have to use the teleport to get back to Lane in which case you could use the telephone for the bottom side play currently echo-fox going for the hard invade iJustine exchange on topside Mike Young's does move in with a bottom lace steal away the red bug that's pretty nice right there also want to point out that Cyprus cooldown is 30 second shorter than solos so even if it's nothing but spreading water is going to be a 30-second window where is got something else wrong but not rolled under plus he has to be super careful. Solo does it have any Vision on stand for in and the current plate is about to go down survivors about the cash in NY Erica Fox making another power play on the bottom side of the map Mike young starts at the dragon and they're looking for their first objective I got a silver Nautilus really early on and has gone pretty well so far, quick relief Cloud Drake which is actually pretty big four season is mostly walking at you keep in mind that several off and
