I was ready ready we are too and Zoe it's not it's not too surprising he has been a monster on the champion even when it's not showing up in the kills you have consistently been able to poke bowl out picture of the mutual objectives through that play and we were able to see that evening yesterday so I was because one is off as well wait to find out what to bring out but gaming I do hope for their sake still feel comfortable they feel confident they knew they had a very very good game yesterday against or the week or teams are still a good one for a while and you put that last 5 minutes out of your mind think maybe the guys are gone the way back up and Piggly can still feel comfortable no threat for hockey well that's not much of a surprise no stylist for the who need to mount a flagDan we did they cut a very good early game yesterday as as you're saying and if they were up 7 AK against hundred thieves but it was much more of what they did with the lady that was concerning for Fennville know they weren't able to actually Secure Care & Vision they never actually even attempted to Barron went ahead for a good 10 12 minutes then completely ended up throwing away that leaves so if we have these what question was like when they are there bats in is an aggressive team very proactive being one of these guys are on and see if they can get back to that and be able to clean up their late game of it and I think Kuni getting beat at your picture is going to really believe his actual best Champion right now he has been very successful on it. And Stage as well as His Highest winner in solo queue does we like to play a lot and it's a strong match up until almost every top cleaner to 1316 / all within a few because when she got nerve to heal faster to go over presently went down for like a hundred percent like 70which felt a little surprising and good to see her back and I think it's still a very very sparkly jumper on IG mentioning I think this point I can be a result of some of the more you know people are worried about them the Conqueror Champions that are getting buffed up cuz that could be concerned but galio Jarvan coming through very likely it is almost always going these days and for the Jardin is could be top or jungle we have anything in the other regions in toppling quite a bit before bringing out recently in the LEC a butt in North America that has primarily been a jongleur still absolutely wait to see what they want to do the flexibility is always nice one of the benefits of red spider that you can wait at the very very very end and move all of them around so as long as they don't they can always try to find themselves a good matchupstill wait to see Alistair has been locked in not a huge surprise there has been amply one of work is at most played since he became number 5 on a house there for him and I like the way you take for fudge especially because we know that big looking play it in their last when he played against golden Guardians the monster in that gave this could be flexed a multiple-lane and while I was saying that he is likely going to be playing the Casio really hard to know exactly where they breed a blue side draft Where The Red. Cannot actually tell what Lane the Champions are going and you lose a lot of the right side of integers is generally considered those kind of face and also worth noting here as we look through this is one of the very very rare games resolution is not on the draft at all Apollo one of those real or anything else they they could of course still flecked with the irelia grabs up I think it's pretty likely activox don't ban anymorebot laners if they can reliably predict piglet may play that opportunity later on the draft if you want to put it down the line it's like three big braids to carries Revolution and improved Aurelia and Matthew and the soul and the cat would be very feasible but it doesn't I think a lot of bands are coming out because that might be reasonable I do think that galio is one of those inflatable support so honestly and Lucien maybe the sort of Champions you do that Lucien plus the Alex are could fly pretty aggressively what you actually pack at galio yes he has Rose hard to get onto but you're so galio pics keep in mind we are seeing wrecks I still available and in what the Darvin. If they want to push the right nowand I get that anyway it's not going to look for looking to spend your right now by Ayo and Teo which makes me feel like Demonte maybe actually taking that Cassio because both LeBlanc as well as the Oriana attend to be free tough matchups for for there where you don't know where they are going to grab a draft that clutch of a fold-out but we'll have to see if they can actually execute on it because it does feel like one that needs to be aggressive you needs to be a head since you don't really have a lot of seating potential as you have no traditional Marksman is fairly short-range with the auto attacks that becomes difficult and if you get behind could look ugly butRicco's what's your top which is the biggest your counter for a Stacker 3 mashup like on a scale of 1 to 10 what is uric irelia and Cassiopeia in New York do I probably that's good you are going to get bullied early but if you can get to a cow and started working on your Triforce you can actually paid out the cash home because she's relatively low Mobility if you hit that you can win A-1 B-1 yeah so essentially lose it all stages generally York has the most Trouble With Champions who can ignore the cage and are very mobile hard to hit With Yuri because you cannot have that your Google not go on them in and out of your cage can use the Eon the ghouls to kill them as well irelia likewise with a Q dashing around Jeff do the same thing as to the Comfort level that these guys have on the Champions more than a match up that's what it feels like as well cuz I agree with you is Ice-T also magic should be so good and and yet it's not was being played right here if we had such numbers oninterest Sandra when doing so that was a blind Sandra puppy also in afterwards it'll be exciting in to watch for clutch Connect Four game 1 of the timer for this one as you say if the month they had the answer and pick his actually elected to which I cannot remember the last time I saw this it doesn't make sense that you're going to be bullied early with that similar to how people use it on Cassian Andor collie to sustained through somebody's early matches that they feel they're going to win later on about that being said, car has been so strong for so long on yacht so that you almost exclusively see that Keystone so Demonte definitely taking a more defensive approach going exhaust take you sleep just trying to survive the early game andI'm getting really interested to track how that top line goes because if Kathy was left alone in isolation and is consistently hitting those huge can certainly believe York for the same time Casio generally has to push to really believe about the Champions and then you're exposing yourself to the G4 plus your combo and if you're able to kill off that Cassio get the ark head but you could look pretty good team definitely could I think about how the Champions interact as well there's nothing the Cassiopeia can do that really stops the crocodile or movement of either Solo or Panda a can stop the driving up because delete you through it so you can't even tie me the flag of dragon the early levels and you can certainly I think find some gangster we'll see what happened we are going to be playing Red Ball 4 drag is not a ton of the champion for him he was spotted out by that word that was dropped on Raptor so they did actually know I believe that he walked by and just bought that out so they're trying to trying to have a deformity keepass perhaps do not actgetting released but they can be spotted you can see panda is a lot after on the pier he's already working on the drugs while lira is still on his first camp and it's going to be a bit behind the face at me and see if course the little ones all been split apart now in a company has a cool-down you can knock on a bunch of these attacks easy clear on that camping on the rap to see I definitely pacing Advantage here for the Darvin we'll see how that pays off overtime for now this driving is out of man that can be considered a certain point if you can't get the blubaugh for a kill of scuttle crab to get your man to pull back up and with that foot actually he's not going to get spotted that much faster and he may be able to go to we'll see if they actually want to try to backtrack over and go for that I've been looks like you will just be going for the blue buff yeah Tony has the pussy just like the fact that Phoenix was subbing they're just going to stay on that.what is the risk your path view path back to topside and you can't get that settled then certainly you're putting yourself behind different word right there standing over is that I believe would have spotted so look through or sorry I can't come through if I remember correctly either way lyrics the right call get stop side Scuttle they've taken so far pretty similar camps and we're okay as you mention he does have that pushed off lanus plus ACS now so far being pushed by the Overland how much was surprised of course he's really on we'll see if that turns around later yeah you know much more about all living as a marksman Lane in the throat of melee matchups you are free happy to farm and it could have tried to keep them pushed in you don't necessarily want to take the island lights and do for rally announced our that's more what it's about it's about setting up for either Lira to come down with a predator gank or just winning an all-in to be to yourselves and they do have ignite plus plan for any potential taught that can come through to peel off nailit's okay if you're able to find anything later on and right now it's Plus 4cs for Apollo's how much the has been dropped by piglet as the first of coming through as that Lynn had reset so moderate to small leave for the Ezreal so far at the dodging she was with kleptomancy as well they are the Raptors are gone I've been unlucky is down a camp and have to take the recall so pretty slow early stages you're no one doing too too much with panda is going to be up at Camp off that and we feeling pretty good about it then see how well honey can actually dogs easier because that is really what's going with this match-up is about hitting the morning mess with your queen you some of the ghouls you hit that that gets so much damage down on the couch and I can't even see that this job and is heading topside might be just for the crugs is paying it now but the boss really began can certainly hear he's within Arm's Reach definitely could be looking for that and he is it's a lot about actually being able to hit your to get the movement speed from that Proctor phase Rush try to dodge out on the Morning Mist try to dodge out on the flag and dragon that's kind of how you survived those sorts of place of a thoroughly Mana can be a pretty big issue for Casio in the early stages before you grab me or lust after your cheer or even your Catalyst depending on what you're trying to go for here finds a stump naturally relieve for a bit. Comes through things are the five goal no harm no foul here but now volcanoes that with bwn Aftershock down it's pretty easy to go from aggressive light so Xbox one gets it back a little bit to reset so he's actually much lower on power right now in also had a man on a recall right here feeling pretty good I think about how those of early stages are going I do think it could be pretty difficult to actually get onto Apollo if you're getting close later gamesages Israel is I think the safest Marksman it's fair to say is specially when you do have in your TT rebuild completed you of the seraphs shields sewing things like a nice form would be incredibly effective against all these low range and mei-li champions who want to try to get on top of you so Apollo will become very difficult to a sale in the later stages and we'll see if question really going to turn up the pace what they did yesterday. I think it only changes if there is some kind of like flash Rochester Linde gas will getting in for free and one shot 90% hell that seems unlikely through a nice boring out in the field and also if there's exhaust on the on the Galileo write this is not ignite you feel with the Justice punch is ultimately certainly there are opportunities on both sides but I really do feel like if you're on the side of you probably want to be a fling in a little bit more aggressive unless they're happy going into something like a 1-3-1 later on where you put your rally on the ISO on the sidelines and use try to playoff game like that let me see the first couple recalls come through Taco Bell boots of speed comes to take the topside Squires Bloom but doesn't do much for that there was no play to be had in that little 6 anyway so diving is going to be the difficult with the little extra time that was given over big with you to grab his Gene come back to Lane has not dropped too much farm and he has to go so far as staying safe is now panting I could box I have is not bullying this out of New York is feeling Douglas Regal Midland flight leave for Phoenix in the overall game is like a box that had cut them into doing a small part of that and I think her solo you don't really want to go anywhere beyond the cowl I think completing safe so afraid of flash for flash of looking with the hextech flash caption on the flash list jungler here and Alistar is going to be 6 very soon is pretty hard to actually punished for this so
