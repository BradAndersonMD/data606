Channel Cats brought the stuff and I completely agree I think it's time for c o g to bench tahm kench that it is something that they need to play around they need a bottom when they can put it very heavily with Florida has great not going to switch out these band Corky is here been yet again and this time she'll be walking to you mrs. are the red side to you but I just don't want to see coz picking, I mean it's just going to be another perspective atrox any cure for C9 same thing as he did in game one when you've been out the Camille that's kind of the tip of the hat to work that so I'll Caitlin going to be banned out here by field anticipating another Caitlin pic is that didn't work out quite well for sneaky despite the fact they were behind yeah I completely agree five of the six band actually the same as they were in the first game of the series The Last Time Cloud 9 and now one of the pics exactly the same as well that time the first two picks by cod4 actually I like this but desire Khanit is really nice I do still think that there are there strong Jello into this so the Caitlin is a traditional counter but stand aside Works incredibly well on the recording gauges actually set up for the buy a very well also as far as if you're fighting Powers read we strong in that to be too and this is going to have to change the whole thing installed but that is how to get to breathe in the second bathroom there's so much attention that you're needing to play around ya arranged match up so I'm wondering where the attention is going to be sent out West about wildly maybe some defensive play around there before ctop forcing did I saw you think this is going to come to signify a bit of a change from Cloud 9 and and where they're going to spend the resources on the map I would not be surprised if I might go with a heavy pushing Midland who can then just try to shove and Kiana Rome to the outside look for form in place around this traffic because cashing out the Draven is so big if you can make it happen yeah I agree and looking at the bands from Cloud 9 I'm wondering what they're trying to set up they banned out broadcast Jarvan which basically leaves up so he's wanting and says eulogy take this now or you're doomed which would also want to play something else is also not going to be very picky on a jungle it is cooking in a lazy sometimes I am expecting to be MIT but clearly you know with those jungle band fills me with a little bit worried about a potential pound of paper or something they had planned to they are going to see if they're there last pick Yer keep it flexible could still grab a don't go to laugh right now and if you are coming through Rex form or early early as well on the bottom side of this is very obvious oclg have to be ready for its elise's the one who can answer that early game pressure on the right side and don't start 2 weeks is Draven is subbed out for Caitlin so that is why these teams have been almost daring each other to pick Sewanee because they want as much as possible early power and probably because she owed you need at least a hint of magic damage in their team composition what they can get from you is really showing through here the fact that the Caitlin was supposed to protect the saira Khan snap pic Draven they clearly have this as the backup as another answer into this matchup and I am excited to see how well he can't perform on this pic because it is a very powerful Duo and if you get that Draven going this is the kind of competition that can run over a TV in the midden early as hell there's not a pick in the draft that you say okay let's just play back the same Lanes go that way she will either die or get the kill in the one we won exciting on this is the last game of the semifinals here today Cloud 9 have their 2-0 start for Define just four months ago we had TSM reverse sweeps them on the way to new the spring title TLC now the first time in several years Cloud9 do Evan stopping them at every single turn in early game composition loads on the rift Aaliyah back in middle-aged Raven for sneaky as a Christian and not only is it a first Kiana game of the split it feels like a complete departure from the normal CO2 dial where they're going to play through the bottom and the Top Lane and then Midlands just going to kind of be there but you will need to take the initiative in this game we go elsewhere call split he played in Orillia game a little while ago and that was it but it going to look at this traffic. Cloud 9 coach that stand by thanks guys Cloud 9 up to all right now I want to get your first impressions from this draft very volatile and I love the Draven workout a bottle and they trying to like scaling do you want him to and it doesn't work so I'll probably make some spicy on the bottom and top and made you know so something going to have fun and I still looks way better so cuz I know you have to stop sitting on the bench right now I was wondering if there were going to potentially be Subs in especially with such a dominating leave the team has so far are using subs for that you know I mean Cloud9 style you guys always using some of these games to kind of give more stage time to these flyers regular time or I will anything that you said players before stepping into this game because the last time the cloud I was up to oh didn't go so well family so probably they will not try hard more than before either way we were talking about you can go for that interview house T9 has really done their homework in this Draft date they know team competitions like this can work against Tod however we haven't seen against Aldric a pet barrier the game as well and represent we were expecting it didn't work if you're going to go early early power with her leave right powerful early game jungle her with her ex a hail of blades very powerful early game room you have a roaming and push for miss you if it's great to be so they have drafted to mass at Power and are now going to be depended upon their execution will be interesting to see how that works out something also worth noting is the difference in summoner's between these Markman players on the bottom seal forces that teleport so if stick say let's get committed to an all and you are going to get even more of a risk of getting first down but that being said if you can survive it has a greater than it spends here already Burger King all right now still you playing safe enough to not be found out here the first thing turns milk for second sitting in the Brockton walking right back out but he became state really on right now we're seeing heavy pushing the topside ruin of you expecting that match up Nikita not get me hooked on the way back so no root come in and just yet but we seen toppling pressure defense during the first of the bottom Scuttle here biofrost walk around Wrigley nearby but just be in time to stop this might be able to eat it out to go early game push definitely going to the fattest E9 both of them in the bottom line is always going to places where they where have you been at 6:15 and see us with iPad Mini waves as well done Midland oh very similar here as if to use 2828 early but ruined because you saw the ruins days are numbered signs of entertainment is going to find that kill first part of the top wait and see where they go to punish they secure the bottom sides they get Division and then they roam of three people right when Pee Wee would recall so there was actually no way that senile could get out gang in that play endless fix a somehow I teleported into been about me so very smart gang spicy not that really intelligent and ruin kind of plane without respect to the enemy jungler getting in his face trying to sell that into eternity and really volume under it and he got punished very happy because of a straight answer from tonight's the roof if trying to get this way reset trying to pull back from the change was critical he would have had to run out to the left first but even so since you're already behind you if you're not escaping this best you could do is maybe trade flash or Flash but that's usually in the event of the jungle at exactly and we're going to see now who's going to change my settings to win this lady actually had the most isolated death at 25 during the regular season of all LCS players and had two isolated Us in the first game yet another one here it is something to 69 is able to capitalize on especially when Gog had their other two lanes push this one thing I do kind of like about this sort of style it allows you to get jumped on here for knock-back with built-in funny damage to walk right back out of that place. It's going to revisit that point very briefly it's drawing pressure way from the bottom Lane right and we know that this is kind of a counter pick your on the bottom side and they want to bring them here in town to get that pressure on top song right now it's been staring hits. tickets to last and that's the type of aggression you want to see OG foot fence Karen is there to be able to trade kill to read it almost looks like he was going to be just short of the kill where to watch one more time the initiation is it perfect if that's cool and maybe they just kill him before he was contracted because the first who was Dodge they chased into the jungle been scared with healthways got a bunch of damage down on it is time does buying time until Madonna and dreaming to Rome c o g to come in for the kill in his PO we know she would die he'd rather not give the kill over to mortgage Raven instead give the killer for exide which is the very early from this bitch I'm going to go out of steel tea that you love to see Bruno has the face rushing straight back and forth I think I've ever seen you act like she would like to stay can stay safe right there walks right back down pretty full form in the bottom line is right now stopping to buy the solo kill or so at the gate kill coming through ruin is up 15 dies after I still find a grocery list I think it would be quite an accomplishment for c o d to win this game because it is a style they're not that familiar with playing POV on the Keanu the early mobile boots are great for Keanu is one of the highest win rate poop because every time you're able to unlock the real match work calculus pick up pills however it is again miss keys to Leah who should consistently keep the wave shoved in Rex I Cool Whip faster and catches you in the river you're also dead so she was he has a very slim margin for error and is trying to tell me Romans threat against the team who is the best at normally no boots are great but usually see him after miserly dality and some things to help you allow us get that fuel pressure will see if they can ask you on it though would be very excited to see them pull this off we don't want to work here in sincerity is in the area so I knows this potential to be to is coming but here's the rest of it since they're going to claim that kill no problem with the ultimate it is a tall order to take down this defense during the to be respecting your sweeper was just got pulled on for 10 more seconds with hoping that it wasn't worried about because it was C9 just set that up please set that plate of the flame was so well time here besides my job and you're looking to go not thinking at all in I'm the last film into clenching game when he goes all-in on the early game that gets me to be to self with the grave of Morgana has not sticks you don't have you I thought you teleport I was very surprised to see them actually fought the into that all the McDonald's food is so powerful because the tether actually stayed through this I open it there's no actual escaping that unless you can create the distance to 59 Elwell still trying to pressure meds it's like a repeat of the first game except the gang start working out is ready for them again for a very good but you find ruin is filled with well in the farm territory right now please winning the lane in that regard wouldn't be surprised them up and gold overall by how ugly at my grandparents still going to be able to keep for his on Jungle spaces, yeah right here Beauty, level 6 power Spike.
