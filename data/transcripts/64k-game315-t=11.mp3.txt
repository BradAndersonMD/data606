select DSM make a much faster Dave it here today Cloud Nine kind of the same as to get us something to pick them bands kenderton zillion still off the table flower in Jensen's Bill starting course they did when does an alarm for Metrum Cloud Nine with one good engagement put them up 100 in the series to get them here today again turn off the table for blabber very big play making a very big curly presents I Feel Like A Champion with a somewhat limited champion pool with four pics with for fix as well his next most played with more than one is not for everything else is what is a one-off and probably not very successful smell a truck also takefree much always had Greg on a paint jungler but I like to keep blabber primarily on these damaged threat so that he can have to go to the Skirmish digitality invade with laners that are. Or early on in the game that has been banned out against them a lot as well as been the heck room which they didn't actually find its Mark and then he just had to scale up what's tinder holds first and Akron doesn't have a lot of fun if you don't get your another look at baby white Eames brand is so much against them with another attempted it stand for sure going to be setting on a watch for how we can do in this one has not played any Graves all year with different picks up and I was your night going for it here the heck room on the table saira Khan TSM this is obviously an amazing 241what can I do to gain with these hands Duo it's very strong but my eyes will be on because he has been good on Comcast you know the Chantix August once in awhile there but those are much more tasty Champion for the support role then work on is lightning quick engagement abilities actually pick a fight for the team but he also has to worry about his exit past and we have seen the teeth get blown up Steam games that she has done so that it's going to be a point Focus passenger that one feels like the most obviously killings work on right away goes in use both him and you'll at least 141 yeah that would have seen that be very effective as far as midlane team fight counter to work on a good licorice was on the eighth Rock in the devicein the side lane however he was very big for 5:19 winning so many of their skirmishes creating a lot of those openings for them and of course the game winning Pick on Timothy so that's an important takeaway that CSM are grabbing for Haunter yeah I think he's actually been really incredible licorice Amadeus Rock concert band to the list but still up could be one for Greg of course his overall available when I get rid of here so I don't have first dibs I don't expect them to place the split in certainly a champion. Why do people always want to see if you're a champion that has the ability to make big plays for the team I know whether it isworld champion with them big l e c t we saw him one of the players of the game is just last week with a galley I was not going to be the case this time around his dentist takes it away and that is kind of forfeiting Lane priority and you're saying okay you know if you want you can run like a try to roam around and kill people but I am going to be a big presents for the team and have the ability to set up if there's ever mentioning and you're looking for as far as their tanks reading the possible early dueling you feel good against Callie was well who runs After Shock can you answer back they have to be after going to go over to TSN now as well so I think they have an insane back line here Casa Fiesta I think the engage is not bad leprechaun just can die for it now if I was going to find out if we're giving you no likegetting to team compositions PSA test went from a 127 very quickly because not only do they have shredding Cloud 9 in Champions but again they always used for kills ants but I would actually give a shout out to older players I've been watching the founder of kind of logic gaming with very adamant that midlane Nocturne was very good five years ago because you can instantly clear the minion wave if your Q&A Autoplay doctor I have The High Ground but you still exciting for the Top Lane matchups is going to take it into the phone I can't say that I know the HR sacrum a chip at all never seen it ourselves cemento in dodging out of the queue sweet spots and then you can also get a little knock back on the atrox himself is very good at setting up for your junglers whenever I see a cop you would gravitate towards that and it's all a few games so I can for him because he 36 nice actually a huge damage definitely is a secular Leon both those matchups in fact the entire top side of the map of the self-healing camping but it's definitely does have value no spell berserk roktavor to hear anotherbut this will be a very exciting game we are in a game 2 of the series everybody Cloud 9 took down to you soon 3-2 in the semifinals she is a very much want revenge here or over the first time in world history PSM will not make it to that world stage Cloud I could be the one to end that run twice in the same split or I like that licorice is actually running the phase Rush year bought a head rub instead of no very common predator for them to make big plays for the rest of the team and maybe room mid phase Rush it's actually good for your lane because you can convert so much blue speed into damaged where do you get your keys to dodge one of the cute sweet spots and engage on the Xbox to proc your face rash with your Auto and Q Plus and then you have sustained movespeed the Dodge the follow-up once from hrf it's going to be very micro intensive match up here I'll be very curious to see them actually play Alpha Lane phase when they do go for thestrange cuz it depends a lot on licorice using his speed to dodge while Hunter is going to try and correct for it with his uncle dashes and if you don't land something like the second or third cues on him and have him can know make a bad a cosplayer look very silly but again jungle match up their does play so heavily into these two top laners a mess up my plan of the Mid-Atlantic fit as well be rich enough for snow nativist Kate's can certainly be hard cc'd split that is a ludicrously large Champion Full House play Cassiopeia till now I've got first time last one as wellis one of the longest-standing players in the North American LCS has been good on so many different things that so many different times and even though he's under a lot of criticism 20s and losses do people put them on a champion that they don't like he is Joe to be very good on all of them at some time now I can't be comfortable with that we just all right there licorice using is corrupting potion in the queue spam to trade with answer within the lane cuz if you to you don't have to take minion aggro yeah just push him off you can apply your crafting potion burn and Hunter had to see control of the minion Waverly between those times delivered to the very large window to get Circle shoes off and get a lot of trading and you can see now this Landing pushed in and we'll try for that first Recall come throughto the reactivation of the cues from a fox cuz you can have very big Windows where the threat is gone since you'll be able to put the wave does get the rundown Grace a little bit of information here to Cloud 9 as far as Greek positioning on top sides for sure but again. Both Scuttle shuttle for themselves so early double Scuttle control with all the vision that goes with it really nice for them. However just slightly in the gold lead so far we look at the various camps and farms and it's much closer is Nikki and basil Sulphur okay on that really can't despite the fact that I just got picked up to be called little for coming through for blabber Craig and if you want to go backwith the first major plays in this game is so far it's at the farming base to the top side seat at the full Fleer where you do quick second and then kind of reversed down to the bottom trying to farm up get that level 64 Nocturne as quickly as possible but Rick is already on to the invite because they didn't see Nocturne you can kind of deduce that he went from a red up to croak side Greg over award I think they know he placed it though so they may be aware that there could be a class maybe didn't see him actually play Syd Cloud 9 or going to reveal themselves Greg on the opposite side do you want on to break show me wanted to be a replay of licorice going down to the triplex to splice a towards butt he's got a bell bottom side are able to get one back for themselves and kind of re-established amor Al fruit for the team as Pops I was just demolished and I wanted to reply here we go licorice they didn't have vision of him walking down but he was walking up there so maybe a little bit of communication as far as they could have possibly been a ward place but look at this God and know something is up with licorice is positioning like that great though easy for the focus and down and on spendel there's no more possible Escape so very good by blabber you just flashes over retains the fear tether Denson Trump duck from the mid lane you can see fjords and still in Midland Farmer in the minion has galio came up to claim the extra skill and that was a big swing for cloud nine topside communication on the fact that he was coming up because you going to run for the wall walking into the galley of good plant gets a Flash Thompson uncoordinated play from KIIS FM on the top side not quite accounting for the movement of Cloud 9 you don't always have to have the perfect vision of the enemy's game but read a little bit into the positioning that they're going for and see if they're giving away anything I hit it and it's hell as far as which side they're hovering meanwhile the doctor every single time is Champion is pick every single cancer talks about this guy needs to snowball this guy needs a curly so he can use his old kills level 6 on doctor now don't have paranoia available and there are flashes across before that are possible to punish this is not level 6 yet and then they got the kill on bottom side for GSM used his Flash and look at that up there 7.8 to 78 Ford with a how much fresh to the atrox had in that size biggest steak in a white thank you very much that's been putting them in up there and this one around its cyclical level of pressure and Cloud 9 when people were talking about how scared they were of the scenes from strands a big reason cited was that they can run anything at a high level and this swap of a heck run which even surprising in The Jungle Book actually just to take you a liar and swap it topside into a good matchup into the atrox here and being able to have licorice play quite well bladder not going for in a bag don't let me tell her keeping a trundle safe because the old right now with such a powerful tool yeah with a lot of TSM liners not having flashes and he does kind of waste that one but we'll see what the pause is about in a second and right now it's been talking with the rest maybe it's on him and it wasn't about the jungle is fighting but I got to wait to see speculation to be later either why so late
