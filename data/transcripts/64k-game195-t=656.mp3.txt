tide in the standings and I want to quickly posit that if I keep the form they had in the first game they look like the favorite in this to me looks like at least to me the battle for the last spot in the quarterfinals of course there's still more to be played with this is a type 1A anything after what we've seen so far in the Pro Champion point out that was the early van Renekton by he looked at on blue side I think quietly Renekton has gone under the radar as the second strongest champion of the world second highest present exactly 9:00 and 2 when he goes through with specifically finding it on Blue tide he liquid not confident in flexing that pick between mid and pop which is going to hurt their overall flexibility additionally when you have a look at something like Deon or as well which was saying in mid top Band jungle this is an old pitbull for the liquid line up I don't necessarily have the most flexible solar lanterns but when they are on their pick they do have great impact so I think that this is the game plan this is what you should expect and liquid is a lot of gamescrypto fought in World a game plan is very difficult to disrupt I feel getting the best Marksman on the patch for doublelift is certainly going to be a step in the right direction and I think it's even better for them to first pick this because nuclear it's so comfortable and I said looking at this group overall I feel like Dom Juan and after you are somewhat similar in the back of their very sole focus and it's based off of having the same coach coach him without his coach in 2018 and and Don Juan's coach now and Team Liquid is much more applied Focus T believe her only Hospital on flexibility with the propensity to take a Mason to the bottom line is they need to be able to balance a composition bookduplex pixel eyes it's one of the most flexible person who picks you can have a specially cuz it's not often you have a support jungleplex I got is also a big block light bulb order has been at Worlds I would say he's been out the potent so far the question is can he keep up that level of play first time they played he played Jarvan with the support galio and they pulled off some good combos that's not what they're going to be able to do today so mechanical definitely put to the test or xmithie now I've been really critical of the cow pic throughout the entirety of the world championship I think I tend to agree with your motto but it has turned into a little bit of a bite out of the conditions for kale when she is going to be successful from what we saying is he ability for the carry you going to all to get themselves into the fight now who benefited brackets yes will combo to be able to set that up if this is going to beI made or bottom line kale we painted candy protected in the toilet Lane old would not support and with the right amount of vitamin could certainly set up a very potent I've called likely to be a middling know if we look at the performance from Jensen in week one I think it's a risk that a dumb one of the willing to take that they don't think the answer would have to El play it and then that would push the gas where the stuff is going I think that's the best bet they would have loved to have seen Caleb and Katie play that with just Moana in the middle and that would likely he was the final bands come through a r l e n Vladimir to really be a notary champion from what I've seen so far he wants to be able to push up and take over some of those ripped the right side is it felt to be the bottom side of the map to the soo gragas in my opinion so we'll see how the rest of the drive goes yeah and you could see how many Solon band Team Liquid was throwing probably because they're expectingCastle Rock to a bottom late anyway cuz he blind box will there any bands out of here so I wouldn't really do that so much but born blind the Saiyans are going to play here because I guess they think I'm looking for a sauna be up in the meadow over here so high on a Nivea in an all-important game of the start of week 2 going to be incredibly potent however anivia historically has not felt well with anything that can bolt on top of an idiot if you interrupt the ultimate can't lie to a bad time in that actually is going to beangry playing tabletop they can do it now because this island isn't going to be a lame boy so potentially I believe it's possible Scion hits real hot and if you take it. You have something like a lease in for like the follow-up 300 damage solar loan Lane 94 world so far thank you another one of the top physical damage ones but Corky of course not be sweating show America's play plenty of times is it going to be a very exciting draft to see because impact part of the reason to you one last time would that impact was so much better than agree several important one draft in my head because also corki mid has greatly falling off but schomaker would be confident with Corky person if you match up and we're going to have to see how the other game plays out and whether or not those Soul enters end up being volatile siding match up here T liquor download welcome back what is the last team remaining from North America right now. After this one open again to keep Pace with Sophie to make it into the quarter-finals groups absolutely in as we take a look at these compositions one more time I do want to throw back to what Missy said on the desk he said he's being surprised at which the pace the team liquid has currently play the game he thought I would be much slow off much more we have much more about that team fight well if there is a confidence built for that I think we have located on summoner's Rift absolutely and Timothy's Point Team Liquid did work on their ability to close games quickly in the ALCS they had the lowest average game time and the best early game of all the teams in the ALCS so even though they play more control that doesn't mean that they haven't been able to close out games quickly and on the side of Dom Juan de trucos up games for the quickly but typically not with early game strength is this Alliance well are we seeing the lion swap you can see the level one in Bay tell me on the top side of the maps is taking Raptor can have changed so listen Loki sportsbeat Dom Juan in game one of their best at 5 with the Lancelot it's because not everyone is completely disrespectful to the strategy and allowed himself to get do this isn't impact taking the red. This is par for the course don't worry that you got to read about this plan so if you'll be closer to level 2 by the time he heads bottom line and not even that of course we're going to be in a critical jungling landworks red bus leave eggs and can it be bad to see if it has to take well there we go that's what the size 4 decode it does make a lot of sense because another thing that we agree to this but that is 0 XP entirely for the kale again from Lakewood because it can impact lives to return time and actually he can to help support this still going to be able to get to replace the one downside you do see if lanes blocked this was the chain that was made to make green salsa less likely was the Ritz take half or not in bottom line they're still getting some money out of this one so the penalty for late is Les Gold or gold level one and going to struggle to find my phone all of these crates impact in the game is just being able to feel fine now we can't stay with the red bump with glacial augment this is actually a difficult and I feel like to be able to play ya a plus for me 40 L on this early game strategy just the fact that they decided to rain swap knowing the dumb one isn't that drilled against it because they actually showed on their the warden jump make an immediate adjustment they could have but they were slow to it not rain. Completely charged with the first three waves of the game and Karrueche la300 gold Advantage II start and not only does it take me to get to Zion but even the players are playing unusual Rose nuclear is now essentially a top laner play no one gets impacted by the way has thousands more experience in a game like this and you got nothing to decide which is either on the last thing I do want to mention about is the fact that isolates the Midland now this is the area of the game with Olivia is so vulnerable she is so slow away player at this stage is also black and she really does struggles in the early stages especially if you get jungle brush up towards that lane will the ability to split the map give Jenson a size is the length of flight Awards and now if I'm up to was that level think he's going to have to teleport available has completely negated the area of the game that you want to attack this mid-length I don't think there's a fun as Siri is recalling onto a Warren eckery not looking like he's going to try to stop that one so TL going to put themselves back onto the Box Light 2 on to another the pickaxe in some extra Mana is there for deadlift back so if the Yasuo broadcast can reset in the bottom when it'll mostly be okay for them at 410 from TL off the start that would not be able to get up there and I sing of the cake for this very potent early game will see with the recall is coming out a nucleus with that I can still Force around the objective of looks like that one has scouted and Barrel wants to be able to get some control go team sitting around right they ever in Traverse Town Stephen spawning a lot of this one and steam liquid make their way over you can see double Authority pushing in the bottom wave in Farrell the only one here to absorb any that Farm open so far in these first 6 minutes are sitting at the head will see if they've content this cuz Jesse needs to put the wave out in the mid lane. They might decide to fight his even though kills only little for a little bit scary 1000hp Barrel is around here comes the time can you trade in more impact. He's going to lose his license at 1 pick up a 441 as well as the Drake has not moved and they take everything away from the liquid that went pretty much as bad as it possibly could have per team liquid when you consider that they burn to teleport to actually try and force the fight before but they weren't willing to preemptively 4th to teleport switch. Wood would have stop dog from going for the game well played my dog want to go in the fight actually it looks like the Q from the lease in carbs or by Canyon to expect he couldn't even get the execute on the ocean drink even right here at the end look at this ultimate from Jensen being placed not really where it can get onto Nuku Nuku goes right past it and just destroy it directly to you people ate each Accord night over the back of the pick pick up the necessary tools before they didn't rain gauge as a group I know which is my fight the first time around these teams played one over a dragon one over a rip Harold can you go on the boat and he's already won the first wife out of this game and that's a big game changer when you consistently lose out on this 1600 golden a very early ocean Drake's McClain's even better put the damn one game ahead right now after to really play that if he liquid top plate goes down credit does go to impact that's the lane it still has the gold for himself at a 02 Scion not going to look great and Beyond The Kills and the Drake the kale is the big beneficiary of that fight not we would not have had a way to get gold if mpact didn't leave that late until he level six and a half in that lane also able to get enough gold and a Savory call off so now he's sustaining and kleptomancy and level six of the pale is completely fine nicely 53 CS right they are meanwhile look over to the midline as well show maker who got two of those killed 83 CS highest in the game that man is rich right now and not Corky last picked by the whole top it's alright it's up to me now he's doing a great job of this one's you looking up forced off their bottom through it and more on the analyst desk however if he's roaring so much
