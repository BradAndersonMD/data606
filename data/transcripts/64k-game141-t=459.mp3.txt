as the team's floating the Champions flag freaking Jack take it away thank you very much. I am freaking to my rights to be literal IPL Champions 3rd or 1st 2004 at 5 and 3. I forced a mortal's every week I go into it and I look at their schedule my say good day in front of them games this week in the LCS where the teams are very close in the standings and I'm hoping for a little bit more clarity afterwards but what usually end up happening is datejustcloser and closer together so I just feel if you got to game separating 2nd from 9th beer in this league very exciting. Pelicans first pick in his fourth to take on this and anything else but I'll check has been really successful for most of this year it's one of the big reasons along with that committee for a lot of immortal suggest I'm also kind of happy to see you're born so highly prioritized I said last week on my podcast real XP that I think everything to take one like if it's available in the draft may be a champion like Soraka should be above it but the fact that you can play in table for mid lane it can wash most Lenny faces and then scale while later means you should just do it so I agree with that would change of really drylook at a bar a second take my coming through here as well it's not going to just yet it's been going through on the bottom Lane is beer a whole lot of pretty good as well they are not wanting to engage your Immortal yeah and after moving on scratch will give a little bit of extra Mobility for Affiliates but it's not nearly the type of protection Christine earlier in the air with like a brommer of Tom kench pairing so you'll possible for Mortals to attack that and some of its kind of weirdly happen in this week of LPS drafts isI'd say in the first 4 weeks you usually see a jongleur picked and paid one but we keep seeing both teams not taking it here maybe because of increased priority on orange do people are locking an extra solo laner early on yourself you can see a bunch of Jungle Band come in here and face to yeah it makes me feel like in general consider that may prevent the jungle looks like it's fine to feel something almost as good and you know who are going to the Orange is very shallow and Aidan cares if it's very shallow is the fourth very shallow and so you know I think it does make sense if they really kind of Power Band by dignitas I do wonder if the Szechuan East doesyeah this is us are not in on this path to playing on right now but we never got to see a whole lot more of her probably the band face in next weekend's games but says want he's in very very big Frontline right gigantic TV thanks. I afford MF can you play them into the back line and we're going to be if I can put out damage himself any possible you can talk to you to make sure they get a load of damage they can just take the Garvin they're trying to match with some really gangster Greg I'd say their compositions does have the ability as a juggernaut mean incredibly high damage Champion used to build Julie Andrews early is good against a group of tanks and then FL EOS 1 PS3 items can heavily shred tank so they don't really have an issue in the DPS department I think it needs a lot of flexibility here probably pick her I going to go to Oriana here just give me a story on a game in 9 so by far his most played pick he's currently to into on it and I really mixed feelings on his Oriana where I know he's really good at it and he almost always wins Lane but this is going to be like my personal opinion I don't necessarily like him on Oriana right now because so many of dicks games go wait and the late game reliability of Oriana is too low for me I would rather see her cuz you suck enough winner that he's going to be able to power up and that damage would be more reliable but we know they clearly have a preference for Orioles now V stick and its mass with a fork you so we're really looking to go late game and that just played it last week and the current traffic is very very strong events going late reliable damage and Magic damage to go skiing competition otherwise mordekaiser gets Invincible with a miter Armour Staffing still takes the right pic installation and then I could have performed well on the stand it's going to be fun to track that midlane as we move in like how much can frog and win that lane by and what can he make happen with that pressure because I have games where it hasn't worked for frog and Joe Rihanna has been up 20cs but doesn't take Midland power doesn't make the successful it's like the cookie cutter criticism of frog and sometimes happen when he's on I will see to go get his way out of Elena get things to happen for the squad dignitas in Immortals on one game of fart as they load me the rift VR game 3 of The Day of the ALCS and worlds tied for a year probably thought that fragen was Mick dip in this game or so anywhere else but Mark said it was all about the jungle difference that is not up for debate Willie curious TV again I called back but analysts said when I'm a little on the side of probably in the fact that I don't think Greg is as bad as a lot of people say and it's not to say the Greek is a super top-tier Elsa jumper but I want to see more of Greg taking control of the game rather than being like an errand boy who runs around from Lane to Lane that's where I feel like he's struggled in the past but when he actually does go aggressive I feel like he's been fairly successful he's up fast with fighting immortal thanks guys all got the job with me Immortal currently 5 and 3 coming into this game I wanted to pick your brain on the current sentiment around the excuse me Immortals wondering can't how long can you keep up the success I mean as long as we keep bugging you should be should be fine I don't think that anyone besides United showing in st. performance otherwise you know it's not like your mother's being horrible and I don't know TSA I want to see something amazing as well as we just kept how to catch up to the do you know the train so at the moment I mean we have a small lead it's not like well like five fathers fogon but we don't pay worse than any other team so I don't really mind all care about what they say about the team looking at school discrepancy between the mid and junglers what are your thoughts on that I don't know but I'll let you get back to deep backstage but good luck back to you guys how to get very much hope you have a very tight race here in the LCS will be closed up the first round robin nine games then we'll be the record for most the teams that have the Des Amis Stone Corky Ken Lovett I'll talk about on Eastern a little bit more throughout but I wanted to touch him to have a teen interview right there and you and I were talking about this for the cash as well as like what do we make of Immortals at 5 and 3 cuz I think a lot of people really want to say like oh the second best team let's start defending them as I can talk to you in the ALCS I would rather just talk about like celebrate the success of getting the five wins so far and know that everyone in the LCS is very close like one win separates Immortals from big and I think to win separated 2nd from 9th in the ALCS so far so great going for a successful in Bay sinks aphromoo I'll get back to this point is going to have service in Jungle can I saw two look great and it's a to Camp lead it's 3 minutes in but they have killed exactly one that's the type of aggressive bring that I like to see right Keys taking charge the jump his supporters following Greg into the jungle rather than calling really starving out Xfinity early in the game but overall at this game kind of progressives what's that what she said at the start of the year is hey I just got a bunch of really smart players and even though we didn't have them at practice before the season we're going to be able to win games that way and I think that's been how they found a lot of their success and if they are to continue winning it's about making sure they can get these men like with wind conditions in fact filter experience and smart players can find a way to be and so far it's been pretty good for them right at 5 and 3 and on the side for 4 and for looking very good right now I ended early game is finally I can to get to the recall off get some control Wards and try to get some Vision stuff done Greg they'll get to the top schedule now as well level 4 as a two-level lead and then look to me please stop the pain at crust top is pushing there and what is going to be on what are the opposing jungle dignitas will. Be stopped there is great. I think they like take to win your whole jungle has already had like a farmer camps but keep forgetting we're asking if you would be she got him with the squires Bloom he had the top wind pressure through hunie like dignitas really coming out of the gate firing so if watching where this last don't hit like it's really knows that he spotted but he says okay I have to Smite I should be able to just secure this but expected you don't have a flash like so I can't follow who he in do you just going to die there so really nice aggressive play anak Smithy kind of uncharacteristically doesn't respect the other driver having a branded old man I'm not sure if you're not going to walk into melee range what's the boards down get this like it's a boy self kill the middle of four for the damage is there it's still a win for immortals 221 in that fight a raptor where we go we know that some people talk about the bot Lane party the mid laner top way parking off the rafter party that's what we have going on in this one rig does pick up another kill and ask him if he does die again so that's gas will be even bigger but the fact that there were killed going over Mortals does help them catch up yeah I never saw him so I have to go to a board and Bourne interrupted recall in order to get this off and yeah it's just a little bit later and it happened who could have waited a little bit longer then it might have worked out for dick but Immortals definitely more group and on the same page for that play thumbs down this for himself he is down 7 PS it's getting better from her to respect out of that wire like in the first move get on the board a little bit there is Greg do still feeling so comfortable in the jungle he's still got pushing Lane spots in throat right now as going to be a pretty easy Mountain Drake. Very end of the game 1000 Godley just in the jungle matchup but the game is only $700 Parts when Mortals are winning in the other lane. Advocate back because if they kill he was able to pick up and Greg actually a thousand gold up on xmithie the big thing will not kind of need to track is like what's driving going to be in this game because looking at the team composition for dignitas this might be a tank driving game right you're going to have a bunch of damn coming out from your dragon off mordekaiser Johnson's going to scale up into Lake game but there's always that question when you have that early start on Jarvan Like a Warrior and try and hard carry cuz if you go cinderhulk this will lead well nice won't have a huge amount of character that's totally agree I would actually really not mind Warrior for Greg in and look at him so cute right now there's three tanks and of course he's going to be out of your way for most of your place it's an instant cash value Barron always going to die if you are. As the ultimate so much just for you would be fun I was going to make that Ralph Anderson hooked on and I think you weren't really surprised by that he's literally you know that can help maybe we'll see how that you do turns in but not too much damage that has week X-Men apocalypse through the Raikou breakpoints for SS used to always say about a committee as they were winning for consecutive championships on Team Liquid was like no matter what happens in the early game oh really good Lantern as full-time that's almost nothing back to the Smithy is no matter how bad the early game went could always make the next plan goes down and say yeah at 8 minutes I'm going to be level six and I'll be able to gain van and then what happened so like yesterday or the game went really poorly but like let's see how it's made by this way back in the game he's hard farming is jungle that's clearly communicated to a lot of these players you can see so
