great I was wondering how your long I was going to have to wait till you see if they like that it to our patch 11.2 gamesir for the LCS all of the team agreed they wanted to be up to date on the current past didn't want no lag behind at all but not a lot of dental changes to ProMedica we expect a pretty big differences so far Olaf and Thalia are both open and knocked her and has taken the place so already there must have been some scrimps stuff going on Nocturne got really really good Bots bo4 jungle and Priscilla Lanes reducing the cool down significantly on the Q definitely helps a lot but those rolls are we going to get the oil off here or the Thalia we get neither so they wanted they want to don't want to give up or just one power jungler call Nine West to take you know whatever is left after that assuming a lot of is bics you know they're probablyAP response here and FBI against E-liquid back in the regular season very aggressively and Hulu with an 80 carry off of something like a it's a lot of Lulu is a possibility as well who I am partial to bot Lane also a really big interaction here whenever you see Olaf and Kindred Lulu pick on the other side this already touch with these are dipping their toes into hard engage and dive with an Olaf play style and you have lots of counter and Gates year on cloud nine defensive Kindred ultimate Lulu Shields this team already looks like they want to cut back like they want to have some Zone control more things you can layer on top of that you can have Galileo you can have Swain you can have both picked up and those are good options to a hundred thieves take a couple of the tools they expecting Cloud 9 to go for is always the possibility of anti Synergy grackle to run out as gay their lands and you get no Knockouts but yeah they both work really well against Telegraph zones like with the ultimate either you cast them out of the inborn ability or you guys land right at the end and Sofrito by Victory so will be fun to watch what kind of these can do with their heart and Gage orellana going to the answer again another display Champion Self you can help kick you out of your own can adult there as well or keep people alive as you've now got three supported fix for whoever's down there already is a big departure from what we saw from cloud nine for the entirety of locking tournament so far it was Cloud Nine all three early takes looking for things like hack for looking for all these dive composition we're going to do for aggressive already as you're saying lots of supportive looks for them lots of kite back so to put a lot of weight on to spread and we get to Hype up even more the bottle a batch of here between hundred thieves and Cloud 9 a lot of talk going around who is the best in the league who is going to go vs. Team Liquid nail for that for that crowd this game is going to is going to really determine a lot of that so let's see how Santa got some no change in the way that you can actually have practice player props on your queue now so I try to take that one off the table these are definitely some some small changes that were at least seeing already in the big dance the son of band makes me think Samira is pretty likely Senate is I would say the single best couch pic into Samira all of her abilities that matter or base getting you into the woods Auto q u e u ignore the W it doesn't matter at all you out range by absurd amount is that a lot of gameplay left so that was one of the options again that is the most standard late-game hard carry special with caixa is gone so is it going to be raining it's you know possible that support Foster Grant Gustin still talk like we don't know just yet but Misfortune is an aggressive later and I'm curious seraphine is all set are tripling down on their hard engage year of philius picked up at the perfect 80 Kari when you expect your opponent to be charging you with a bunch of mail a freak see him trying to cycle through get those truck rims going and you're going to have plenty of Shield to work with you have a kindred Cloud 9 taking a more supportive defensive kite back look that we've seen all tournament long for them showing some flexibility here already a game number one of his best of 5 we knew that these teams had had more flavors I'm glad that they're wasting no time getting straight to it has meanwhile they have plenty of tools to steal Triforce this through especially early on so it's going to come. You looking at these level once when you have Olaf versus Kendra there's a lot of potential for level 1 invade here especially on the side of a hundred thieves I think they would benefit greatly from trying to get a deep board and even possibly trying to split that map yeah we going to see if the map does come through I'm just thinking about the team comps energy still where I was a little surprised to see you're welcome through overall I thought there were other being a really adopted out there but if he does dive in of course you can vacuum everyone in but the ultimate didn't help keep them all in the same play for in the Galleon smash is down and out what else goes on the Concorde Misfortune over-the-top it's also very obvious the only thing it's not really part of the, because you can miss play a days does braccus possibly going a P with a comment locked in there of course in a rain in the first place but it probably swing Aftershock regardless so it may well be AP gragas of the top side that means that the who he and closer to tank for the most part I might be difficult but we'll see if they can make that would happen as I'm still very interested to see what perks and Sven can do as the primary carries but of course can do really nicely on the Kindred as well as long as you don't get run down by an Olaf in the early game and I would definitely highly highly value AP gragas hairburst gragas over tank gragas because you are not trying for your overall game plan here for lunch with these to get to later stages of do front to back with you know it take EBT Boi. There's too much support and licking scaling with all these shields compounding on cloud nine that's what they want they want to be able to set up a vellios for Godlike late-game carries here we can do it all to save them solo Lane Lulu buffing of up so I would much rather prefer some day to go with the AP burst try and get that first kill you if you get a priority Target yes it is messed up over there errors that could occur here with your goddess and it doesn't have the best setup but you have to have confidence in your play when you're going for an aggressive style like this actually the case so let's make sure the coordination is on point here as we start early wave clear and after watching some day lineup against fudge one thing I found out stats command of this game was the fact that the new lineup and Afraid you know how could they not be at Opry team statistically so far Justin Ladyface some deicide a week or first 10 minutes then hauntzer did last year there's more Lenny face of course has more League of Legends but just statistically the early game so they has been yeah and I definitely know some of that where those statistics are coming from to look the actual games remember specifically that Jack's game where he did not get jungle pressure from his own team from closer got camps fairly hard plus his game for self re did not go that well in the lane phase the atrox into a neck towel bar I definitely hurting those Siesta Resort and give it to himself whilst we shall see how that Bears this time around because we expect so far no closer to continue power steering here on the Olaf should probably prioritize the bottom Scuttle crab because you're at you're not trying to to gank four-year-old for your gragas super early on for the for the wind condition for your team to try to put some pressure switch off the laying on bottom side with your Misfortune Rail and gain Sympathy for the exceptionally well is the play around bottom side some days frequently on an island left alone sure whatever but there's so many things like this because they're going to set up for a three-on-two referring to in the bottom line and someone's going to die it will happen to the quarterfinals but I've been inflated a group stage games here as well get some of the very very strong teams like Team Liquid make it still make those diets work against incredibly smart players it's likely to happen again if you look at the Gold stats for every player in this game is not going to be careful he'll be fine. For gold purse in the first 10 largest a bottle for these they just learned more than every 2.2 ever again because those diet work to get place to get kills and don't you give up against them and the biggest thing to is that they've been so efficient about they have it diverted closers routes our made him wait around a long time for these plays and I think a lot of credit does go to Devonte and midlane who has been so good with controlling it to wait for these times you'll see so many of these rooms prepped where he focuses uses a lot of his health a lot of his Manda even is teleport here already super early on the bill to get those windows to work with closer so they can have a very successful and efficient Kang and this person talking to me anyways this is a couple of the turret some day going to go for a bit of damage Stone teleport through the shield not much else to do and someday chugs through to get from it will matter when he needs it but still running a bit low bladder closer to my day going to be pretty soon topside is closer about these chickens being inside a big backup it also possible topside divulge already boarded some people have two medical foot pedal buddy first plug goes to cloud nine hundred thieves is Daisy the teleport and they still make the call to try and burn the kill and get out afterwards closer flashing to try to finish it up but already we see the Shields coming in the front Grayson starts to brew here four hundred thieves someday take sat hours. Uses full combo before the rest of the squad arrives so they don't have to knock up there to my day does get the talk but he doesn't damage that uses just as much to gain range and then not being able to get off that last little bit of damage 400 these not only does fudge survive but Cloud 9 get first blood and you're giving money already over to the team that has great scaling but when your Leah fellows here for you can you see your top side getting a Teleport counter play defending the dive getting first blood money in that you are so so happy smartpractice plays do person recall before that fight started so I think the guy was coming had the Mana pool to make sure that fight went pretty well and pretty good stuff right now I will the line Demonte for the Miss just as fine she was not one of a crow he did a very standard talk to the backwards e but it's a range Champion that range was not Erin just with it and that's that's unfortunate if you know if it's a missed play but that's what came out at the end so Cloud 9 off weed 900 goldleaf feels pretty good so far but when it's already recalled for the first time they got in their items across bladder nice gets what should be the second mark off of the graph steel and now we got to drive into town from your hundred things with a bit of pressure in the Box side mate still mostly able to trust me or against perks going to feel really comfortable in doing good still keep up the pressure regardless of failing that play on the dive on topside early that's what they're this is what they're comp is built to do they have to continue with it now they've got a galleon ultimate so closer just takes his momentum here on Olaf from Dragon up into the blue but to steal away while his bottom Lanes trying hard to push the way of making priorities well no Smite for bladder knows the blues happening can't make anything happen out of it regardless closer does Brenda Snipes mix to replace it on level 6 guess the buff Steel a while back I was to the Kindred Marcus pretty nice guy struggling there who he get the den to 1 HP FBI take the last hit on the control for it because you're 80 carries more beneficial than funneling it also nice optimization most good teams do that protest any sports out there who won more games just do it. There is a big timer to think about the super successfully for Cloud 9 on the top side but they have no more teleports left say hi to expend everything here for the early game so again it is still the same game plan for untruth he's they should move over closer to pressure for that invade I looked at to make another. I want to see it then I want to see whether to move his mate is on the way over right now through his own control board is the second one turns off of that trinket as well should know bladders over there will just write the board and may give pain go back over to close a result of that one but not going to be too much for Atlanta to bad for Sunday cuz you can see yes has the app to him has the tear is going for a standard AP gragas stuff. Maybe the best item of the game and so everyone who uses FBI roaming up wow closer starts off the rip tale so two players that went to hear four hundred thieves they make a full rotation of everybody up towards the top side of the map of abandoning that minion wave down bottom in yeah it's been does get to blow it up or push it in but resulted in to fold Victory here for a hundred thieves someday Ernie pressure at top site to since he had so much confidence with the rest of his days very end to make sure your cat the game plan freak everybody up there even FBI and who he are buying it. This that is huge huge proactive play from hundred thieves during the time. That we wanted it we're looking at those teleport cooldown they don't have those they don't have to flash their auto warranty
