to be able to roam and that's why candy versus rookie send it becomes the early game matchup to look at cuz she might as well keep up with the most rookie if you can do the same thing just one LPL an expectation sometimes there been some falters from their top team to your IG one with High Hopes here as a first bands come through or I guess I lost a lot of engaged to Lowes br40 rock baby dropping so that volatility I know style out for taxes if I still have a soft spot for losing your want to see that does come through these very strong and again Jackie loves most played going to be one to watch will for sure I don't think you need to early pick those especially with her the current way that the teams are approaching take band phase boxes of course the the hot topic one of them already being banned at 4what does pose a question are you willing to purchase ticket for that trade with the support Champions like we're confident out there is already bad why is it up even more it's very very useful against then also the Kaiser which is kind of expensive has already been quite a lot but it is early but Lane straight away we want scaly but you're actually for G rex look very good to me the Vera Center Kaiser suit give Stitch a lot of power in controlling the way that this Lane goes and I I really like what they do with what you guys said about you know trying to win the Portland what's your nose don't happen once they've won the Portland the best supported actually snowballinghe can sit in Midland and you already have pork chop plate fault that he can go anywhere he wants and you can just continue to pray for the end of Mesquite down really telling me it's all about their piece of the jigsaw puzzle if they are really into your ex last game on Aurelia head rookie ready to accept flex but I'm here to believe in half and it really feel like more of a the chili pic then it is a dude perfect but for baby to try to get against Bill Fitts the puzzle of how do you equip exactlyGary so you can come down and then go Park Lane Osterville I just want to see everything so far is Premier League you know I want to see a really was Olaf in the Middle Lane little bit more and that was the only response to that was Alessandra band but she good in to Lovelock but regardless it is BeBe rexha's turn out of take their pick and they're going to go ahead and make another swordthe sign we've seen it from another one is Elena Smith in Maple of course of treatment centers on right obviously but they will wait to take the flash wolves it's because Mabel can use it to Rome but Lane I get a lot of really control 14 you can do exactly the same here with the forest and Tompkins pics of your ex might just take that page from flash. This really works for early can snowball and sign with Terry and is very late game scaling jungler and Zakir now to do I have a good attempt at an upset here they had a very strong plan performance and coming into this one with the least amount of confidence alright well still flexible Champions with the risewe are really there for Invicta spent the last pick will be syndra into the middle Lane for Druids by on topside to The Boondocks is so line up their Champions the way they want to go it's really does look more of a scaling composite you for ID but player so good they can still win Lenny face here g-rex this will be a tough test for them or you'll either test their hardest test of the group for now Natick later I just think bar for T-Rex like I like to see if they can have I'm just looking at Midland specifically especially if it is going to be the last game and who wins super heavily in. Once she completed a lot of pressure on you you're the best in the world and you cannot die a big part of it is landing enough backwards done here on irelia when she comes in with the DASH diet allowing her one of those Gap closers means a huge differencethe first image that you can actually get off summer spells are going to play a decent part as well expect to keep its of one here out of candy I think the jungle match it might also maybe stay the hand a little bit here off of going to have more skills put no one out by Soul off 45 and that could be a big difference here baby coming in his first game of World on the team played most of the games throughout regular-season petastic jungle mechanically he can be aggressive in your to get money needs to be here we go to first game of the World Championship for IG and a person Mainstay sheer for G Rex autocorrect we go and it is time to see who can do it better this time for nowhad a smashing of a game earlier Group D they made out quickly they could make work of their opponents I jump into battle for that top spot here and they wanted her to do so they're going to see if I can do so or turn things around we've had so many upsets so quickly in the world and coming out of this Champion Select I'm very curious as to the level ones because especially in exact Olaf matchup getting any sort of invade down here to get the information can really allow the team with the Olaf to have a high pressure early game you can really eliminate a lot of the possibilities that doc wants to go for it is a little bit scary for them with the promo codes on the other side you don't want to face check ride in 3 minutes looks like direction is Fanning out completed as a ward in the river to watch the Drake but that's about it since of ghost portal activation as well behind their own Red Bluff to see for possible invade so it looks like there isn't going to be even any sort of scouting going on and this is going to be ablestart off on his own red with a nice pool from the bottom Lane fridge already talked about you know Zach scaling on his side all up early game if we get past here looking with Zak here I love it I can take my time Killing Spree could when you jump in and Tom confess to take this guy next wave you can literally just pulled the time comes with you and into your own heart into play the defensive support against exact Nigeria's get fog of War on their favor and either side of the team lease so baby is going to have a completely blind jungle start early jungle fresh or stale any pressure for a rental in first they have the pressure and they should be able to keep black Jackie love and Valentine under through it if it was a bright like Jackie Levin violin actually taking back control of a little bit of pushing out the minion wave here and trying to get Stitch and koala a little bit back to buy open up some territory for Zack to work with he's gone to Red Bluff santacruz immediately roads are so so nice in the current state of the gameFirst Act to pick up set c a o e magic damage and Craig's are no the most loaded golden experience Camp I've never heard you this is all right it's well it's the best thing that is the best thing about Dexter League a kill ich rugs as early as possible to get to the reset so you can kill them again possible start barely a camp behind again favor here who is doing pretty well the old enough to be expected the bot Lane not plus or minus anything's the fact that ice is holding it against there is already a great sign for Jack of all trades on the side of ice PDF of fallen and and Jack love Landon some damage done to stitch and kind of forcing to be a little more passive and not just permit for schlade early and that's meant that we don't get directions early level to enter I'm fully out just laying here early on at least Uber pool clear will recall to get his food very soon and then we might get the first tank or he said you know what I don't even eat thatnice but other than that one can't believe that all I've got this is not much better looking for GF actually got some more information in sings back on that sell do crab 2 in the only thing stopping him right now from going in for the blue one is the rookie on the irelia because he saw his acting to have it yet he knows it's still up and it's exactly what you need to do pressure the sack early on low-level but you can see the rookie protecting his jungler trying to force him back one thing to note is Nick did you might and that was seen what he wants the jungle cat but there's no chance and see which is Target's whenever a jungle monster does switch targets more of the patient and that was the last little thick of patients he had that's what I call a rookie mistakesuch as life and 30 seconds left for Nick baby sees everything as a ward on him is now back on the map with fruits level for all us first gang here will mean a lot 14 that normally needs to win the early game to succeed and not famous people that like a macro inside of your ex's Wedding March winner lie detector game are really super famous fireworks early on he does have the option of going Bottom for the Scuttle and rerouting through this bottom of his own jungle side so we can continue to his power Farm Olaf also know can we are very quickly and should be able to keep the threat of his credit or boots around mid lane and keep rookie at Bay a little bit really is a protein that level six so you have to start thinking the second mindedly little bit when you're ready not only to 121 potential exact is around the corner and you go for a gank against her you can turn around so quickly special gets a champion like will look when he's diving into rookie but I'm going to tell us where there is Gangster up early but side with Rachel Altman on Sunday in present perfect kind of wonderful 6 on bars and pubs Lane with a sign it's hard to get frozen off again to rage champ like rice I don't feel too late for him to go to work and was so many people here congregating around the mid lane we can caution against irelia level six but stingy as well birthday image should be respected when you are so poor up there or a jongleur going towards mid lane when Midland Arts has just hit Level 6 is one of the scariest time because went in those Scooby Doo's or 383 situation and focus on himself the first cute koala in not going to go for the damage to a pretty easy walk away from the first day comes in stop pushing them back a little bit just get to do a whole lot there to can't stop siphoning to grab after he recalls of if you want to get level 6 back and then we can actually see a really cool thing to watch the time cancel a T-Rex controlling bottom side with the push as mentioned in taking band face also Vision are we still meeting with the first floor and I'm also looking at an infernal Drake on the map right now with Olaf and pushing bottomlands that's definitely a possibility even if they don't go for kills here getting close one down there nice turn around and actually there was a Flash and about not going to just one but it's a bit of alone time infertile he's taking away the Red Bluff right now though they may is going to be on the mini map and are just pushing some damage on to the bottom. I think it's always the argument between and then recall for a nice reset if your Stitch with about 1,300 gold or go for early Drake to Jackalope and bottle and can return to Lane and you don't have to be a secure and get ready so I think I just wanted to call his what's best for our late early recall get my cartilage level 604 play let me tell you some help on Dragon early on either they could with the vision that they have I know maybe allocate that but could it kill time before Powerline will show up I guess that's probably the one that's it no that is the question they decided to answer taking the safe route here they still have so much defense setup through here as far as 6410 that read book jungle for the bottom side top red side level six. Exactly level lead and steel need to be safe and that is rated but still that level he finally won a super effective baby is not finding any early success berkadia to hold his
