game to them when they were on this side clutch was able to ban is BR Corky and Renekton as CLG ban Rumble U me hear no clutch for 6 to Kiana in that game that wasn't the reason the clutch was Victoria that came to with more about Cody Sons asriel Vulcans work on in the bottom Lane how much weight book raugust from Lehrer show is a bunch of individual I'll place around them and hear opening it up it was the same as last time these are exactly the same batch of this point this is 1 c o d band to call E never go all four games COC bands of Kali during phase one that & rum bar the two chips they will not negotiate on field always Rubinos options by there are other lane police to choose from though it is not the only one personally I doso like Darius into Keanu he can do a very similar thing for the lane face another one that definitely won't get used but I think it's is Poppy do W absolutely hard counters Kiana it not only stop the dash put ground to expose you for 2 seconds it takes away all of Tiana's teeth by presence makes it so hard for her to get into place to get a good tables to Future ability to swellAs you move around and play their first said you want a game of this Theory be there talk of taking like last time yeah I do really wonder if we'll just see raucous record here like Clutch Gaming had in game two were if they feel like they learn something in their games for the FIFA think I made they definitely and I had the execution to pull that off and I think if you are going to ask you at the highest level those are the correct fix that is the way to finish out this draft one small tweaks do is they could go with something like trundle or skarner I feel like those are slightly more effective picks against Ted the playmaking from this right. Give you that explosive early-game it doesn't give you the kill power for Kiana will this last time, I'm beginning grab Nautilus which app Remote disagreed with else to handle the pecan Leona is the obvious. But the atrox is still able to come through the champion that was for a blessed and round they were on these sides feel a little bit later all right now does clutch fan out the Leona to make sure that she'll do you want pick it or do they just have faith that okay though probably go pick right back at you at the same time I do like c o g signaled already in game two that they don't care that much to pick the Leona so even if plucked does leave it up but I would imagine funchess confident enough it going to be super comfortable with their the Tod is it going to be very good at playing around it go to the Mind Games you have to play though and we see it support band just not lie on it found the first on the order will see if paper gets joined here as well as it's a concealed You by Clean Bandit keep going to put $0.40 down it was Ezra was just fine last time around there I just got to kill in Lane he was a great team fighter as well as time ticks down clutching have played Karma create rocks last time on the side the Gangplank is when they're more afraid of saying go for the gun Play Karmin he has lots of discussion there pretty fast discussion there was one bar frosting play the unit if Hollister is their final man hasn't played it all split their Darin bio to play it again if he wants to our sorry play the first time ever he wants to or go ahead and take the Nautilus bad for the match up vanity other things that he is likely to play that he has the experience on they've dropped their own time catch bands as well see if she could take the car away themselves but in the middle and it's sugar rush though here that's what I was thinking literally just one with fresh so as far as engage Deportes going through that it's not a champ select counter by any means but it is something by are Frosty's very good at instantly for Clutch Gaming for Kodi side it has been such a big campaign for him and then his lair speed on speed once again Karma into aatrox has been locked it it's pretty similar to the last time they were on this side but they were given the opportunity place never once again which is going to be an iPhone to a playoff series into that folder for answers the key he said Diana was when they want to cry I was definitely a comfort Champion for him he has waited for many many years and come up with any alternate builds for it as well game number 67 of Oriana to professional career most played by farthest paper corporate conference is exactly this Champion Power of evil Back Against The Wall needs to wait two more straight to take third place to go Spurs most played and I think it's the right call for tlg even if it ends up not working we saw games one and two of them trying the wacky stuff like Diana but then we saw game treat when they went back to court Jake likes. They were familiar with and much like game for the C9 series POV goes back to Ariana had a very good early and mid game with it in that series dope power moves looking to perform on a Champion Shoes comfortable with Hackettstown it's the last time these teams has Clutch Gaming close it out here to turn off the gaming with come Perfect Smile price back in the playmaker in thrash power of evil on his trademark Oriana Brewing Bidwell me a chart for Mastiff last time around do they make this one half and he reversed feet still on the table there's play Smash online here in front of this crowd in Detroit or maybe his team's they've been somewhere that's big before for some of them do first time in front of 10,000 people revoking a pretty solid for them it feels like lunch gaining really Rose to the occasion steel g a bit slower start for Game 3 was convincing absolutely cutie need to keep that momentum from game 3 and cry and push us towards a game 5 is Weldon said the only way to practice First Dates like this is playing on stage like this so she only wants to remain here as long as possible do we go on to the risk for game at number 4 what streaming once again have the Keanu Demonte known for its so much and there was excited to watch yeah everybody came in this matchup expecting Kiana to be contested well they definitely have delivered contain the champion why do more going to pop off here let's see I feel like this one was also kind of logic gaming throwing down a gauntlet once again faking clutch have to perform sweeper does get some more experience once again early for the solo laners making good time to perform is CLG we got to wait on the sidelines awfully standing by with welding thanks guys well then I just have one question for you coming into this game we have seen Clutch Gaming have incredible success with Demonte on Tiana and you guys let it through and I mean in game to you weren't able to find that counter so what is the player well and truly tried the assassin vs. Athens and whichever assassin loses it looks like what what games you look like and last game they were forced to let to the Corky so we we kind of knew that that's where we want but I think we have a link additional guests at this game working to try again and tell me about what the teams are thoughts are General feelings are coming into this game where they need to win or they're out so everybody just in a bathtub one mentality and we just have to win the game best of luck best of one do you want to do is be LG complete the reverse sweep seen it before I can see him again before the orianna vs Kiana it is the lane Swap Force EOD something they have done sparingly trucks regular season they did a lot of swamp much better on both sides for CLG than the opposing matchups would be both for the Oriana as well as for the eighth rocks hoodie Karma will get us started trying to farm that klepto Sac hits power of evil pushing the wave kind of dice up to the tower in the game so she just asked if that's going to be really died me so I agree your point that on both sides of his whole lot better facility here AC clutch fan Chase around again too cuz I think that this would also be a game that would be worth that chasing me off the mat here early flash yeah that's going to make that returns so much more threatening and if that wave bounces back to the same spot again it's going to be very difficult through to CST even though aatrox is warp birth resilient you still have to respect to the potential of two people come in your legs kill you a big part of it is a talks has to get closer to the minion wave to farm in midlane shortly before safe vs. Keanu Keanu Fox Lea Farms water elements out of the river and you can speak you for the guaranteed route with a silent to get even Lane cake because of the length of the chains done that can come through and then burning that flashed is not a one-off fuel pass at midlane it should be continued Focus for Clutch Gaming around the mid area strength of touch before we'll see you tomorrow to get ahead get a gas at Sea bottom right here remains one Camp I had some blocks away to mid lane match up with in 1 C of topping with him three really close earlier are you going to have her home on that point you as far as the team constar set up we saw what Keanu looks like without truly threatened or snowball or you know jungle pressure around her Lane phase it completely duders a big game for us since it makes the side lights have to worry about her roaming around getting those big ultimate play or even give you as much control over at the objectives that you're used to self Again lyrics good early past and I think that they will continue to focus knowing that ruined now no Clash at the very least they're going to try and get that she s back under control cuz so far ruined up on CS has been able to use the ace rocketraid very effectively with a passive Auto you know the forced to mate off the menu the Beltline reset the to see a difference right here so Silver Skillet just fine Forsyth licking his great as well so it's hard to give anyone an obvious Edge go support the bit squishy and big Playmakers Wiggly yeah I think we're talking about stealing I would get the cheel decomposition a slight Edge but it will come down to execution in the team fights if Clutch Gaming finds the right flank and gauge at any point in the game they'll be able to fight if your clutch is no heart tanks that is going to be something to watch out for there's no you know which one of the stolen plate soaking up 5000 damage and they're answer to that is going to be a heart CC don't need a heart tank if you have enough Hart Cece and up damage behind that window but it definitely does have a higher. Execution and required to make less mistakes that you don't have a sponge to soak up some of the repercussions of your mistakes but they may not eager to pull the rotation to the swap happy to play this one straight up and it's going to be continued fairly close to equal Farm going back and forth Smalley pruning the top and it looks like TV for both those players actually tp4 CLG is ruin has one Demonte sitting like night noguchi the timing where clutch could look for another kill and that's why you see Wiggly shadowing ruin are ready to begin system on take a selfie stick so your vision I would be a time where you want to get a kill, but you could be closed though or they could just burst out Wiggly five or six and five mate has the ultimate but a little bit short on Manta only about 160 can't everything after the ultimate but no pipe and patience pays off are there eventually turns over for the Scuttle crab don't get the reward reward First Flight comes through to Lira will be so long that while we were halfway through the river he starts to kill a very different it has a Demonte here huge burst Limit and again that control wore it paid so much for them voided physiology cake and allow them to then turn it around on their own terms about they jumping in ignite Kiana able to get them in later lower Splash to finish it up look at the mate waiting for this one up against the wall you get to pull off the entire combo taking him down to 15% HD before there's any way at the time that means the guaranteed kill two players got flash on Silas yeah actually pulls the rock with Keanu for some execute damage down the stretch knowing that we are would be able to close even more rather than pulling back to back water blades for a longer route duration really well done by the mate what's the back foot nine hundred gold down mostly equal or seeing leads getting eats out an HP Sidelines and such gaming waiting to move forward hoping to have the right to work with a set of teeth bites can work out for them to track where the money goes in this game because there's so many options for carries that that first Blood kill actually bottom Lane right that first Blood killed going over to silence is huge now
