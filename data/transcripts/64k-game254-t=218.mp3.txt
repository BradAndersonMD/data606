haven't where you had double of tell Jensen I will get you that LPS title and I will get you out of fruits in here they are doing what many thought impossible for North America only making a shot at winning a horse that looks like things are going to remain the same for the side of you two both gallion taken off the board priorities like they're going to be the job and once again depression is how old can liquid pivot will they continue to take the return of the boat was Silas be the priority for job and be taken away it's off the table not really really good trade a jongleur for a solo Lane pick and it will be dropping taken away this looks like the exact same draft that I can remember from game was driving off the table and 50 most fun a jungle you likecan I change of what in their bottom latest might be more late game with that type of hover lot of mine has been such a focus for this series so far me to have had the advantage back-to-back games down there for the SS on the Kaiser once again very comfortable camping for him & Stitch onesies 4X Missy's will be the front line does have the possibility of for Spartan gauges torch on Statue don't care what they going to have to dance with the calliope that thinking well to be honest you put nothing that can handle is now there is one right now they would like to go. She going to be the fire in the middle and I look for counters in other lanes not just in the lane with work on something I thought was going to come through last time around trying to take advantage of the weaknesses of rakan I am sometimes we will be Champions like that towards the midline actually focus on killing him on the engagesbut not so far if we get the LeBlanc actually opens up even more possibilities for liquids do you get that Spindrift liquid draft for ek221 scheme by a little bit of scaling. Outside of the map but they still provide a lot of value I know they can round to draft out with Mages in the middle name as you already talked about Kobe and they can save that for the final pick as well so to me it feels like liquid in this game 3 it looks like they're saying we want to play a 33-minute team fight fear they remove a team fight made from casting Noah's here you can't help Gala to the mid lane we get first dibs I want to see if it's bendre or less Bond reform or engaged to the indexed even more than doubled being on the damage off with a towel storage sheds Juana Diaz set up we'll see what comes through a lot ofthe place are on the table the only can send a Team Liquid is all they over stacking on a pee damage there is a lot coming through on the side and he got on my bike I said while being an ATP canceled the chat a lot of it. So the question is what direction do they go blind if you don't Libras really like Beyond hit Nico supposed to be a good matchup into that was very good. That could be in a slice of champion first they take the Nikko they expect of Latimer I think I could be on his way here we'll see what the second pick from B2 is going to be around it out currently they have a lot of speed for their engaged not a lot of taking it so it has to be execution faced the thing that the hovering theright now I expect you to come through yet I think this will grow in the hands of TAPS in the mid lane I'm expecting them to you lies the high mobility and the level 6 hole in potential that are really it does provide not only provide more ID damage to the squad but also do you want the main Dynasty against trying to attack the early and often with Rome from your jungler and your support Darvin and rakan will Triana citarelli up and getting killed on to that bendre early on in the game now we know this seems pretty well it's not allowed to the final game of a 0 / Team Liquid go to North America in Back to the most comfortable stylishthe biggest thing a TL have to be cautious off the early game from the side of G2 Esports even though it is harder to play tolls about side of the map of the games and Alice. Do not be surprised level 450 Mickey going back to Rolling Meads grouping up with you and then kill exactly I expect a lot of effort towards Wards around the river and the river leading chords mid lanemy phone is out of the trophy only one of these canals look pretty heavily that it supports from Europe to the International Champions as well begin this house in the first few sloppy splits and then a world semifinal eating orange with an MSI file no chance the trophy to beat Team Liquid that is one of that has m coming right up to see how things pan out in this game through the pressure is on Team Liquid a lot of hopes rest on the shoulders let's see if they can bounce back exactly Team Liquid you mention any championships OG to but this team has had a similar percentage of success with three championships list to their name sent franchising steam liquid has only no success in the North American LCS and now in the finals on the international stage this is their chance to prove that what they were built for not to be exactly that what they whoop that's the biggest thing that I'm looking for a team liquid we know they have the potential to battle the best we know that they can upset world champions let's see if they can do it today as work on that sneaky level one place is made it into this project committee has no idea 650 taking a lot of space which nickels Wheels fall off CC of flag of all going to land here and we'll show him a bit low is he keeps ticking Halo actually from Jarvan trade those bells go with junglers both burning flashes just me it's a little bit of vision of the end learn Bloomin birth natal plus the Keystone toy store Wonder means it is going to be 18 if you as you called him out and not the wits end ruined Kingdom Rush 4 on hit damage it will be a lot of magic damage gigantic team fight ultimate sin Wonder can definitely counter engagement seal tries to do today once again unless they should be able to get Paris on the lane and they're already going to start the push-up very valuable a game designer Raton and I do often like the outfit and silicon pick because every time the Recon tries to go in humidity going to get it something you always have to show respect the game which means that this was Nicki and Brooks coffee as aggressive as they would like to play aggressively you know what you can if your jungle shows up at level to level 2 off of red is able to get the heel first out of + 2 letting the damage of the EQ there and then also getting flag that is true Summoner spells once again early on Accessory ankles early Yangtze might be thinking but will not take that trade like screw pops on to him there's one right behind as well that is not a fight to be had no top Scuttle is the battle level 2 on both the sides that go take him to Camp Mickey looks a fight now I know Smite for a Smithy while Yankovic's does has he have himself but no chance to get that Scuttle crab and Caicos is going to hold on to this might and just Auto it down they felt level 3 leasing some Minion XP helps that a lot as well as if he is both shuttles here for that Red Bluff just been spotted level 1 play on the offensive Reynolds they do have the summoning spell advantage ss still only level 1 as you post about freaking Business Bureau has really struggled throughout this dude so much focus and put on the trying to shut down before everybody has EQ available.
