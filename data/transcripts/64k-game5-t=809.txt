there are three of the site they often i do know what they lost the white horse and thick headed out have oliver i don't get let's get into that silly games where you'd have to deliver every gave out dies down towards international games as well look good you representatives every team striving to be number one at that to get a bite to why don't they do a little bit of love likewise though because that's what did you wanna give a path that he would put games yeah but observe the white actually we're not in these games is that as one who was who was your politics not engage the press is that way there were carefully all water probst with the bottom line at the thoughts of previously bob would you settle our progress on sunday because benefited from akbar move big bear his leadership is meant to worship at the bottom line and when you put in another new player died didn't know about coming approached by that academy at the bottom side they did have some breakfast is good men go talk to the jungle focus on this side he would put the lia if you're gonna go for by the two lead the jungle combo pack for it is dance drama previous larkin mature might jump up though a day cake is place as that than the sweet be shipped across all regions it get forty but we are still a one point two or three give a couple of days ago the nurse that the on your are not in his actors guild really doctor john was that are likely to get taken away and at the abandoned it with likewise do indeed the rigidity or so triple double they have against the terrible by the way our u. b. c.'s as best remember he was the best player at worlds that he's been a bass player locked in the other fifty point leader as well be built to say and think about maybe three time you pretty great that despite resemble that he's still get to the crime who thronged the workings of the gap there are of the other stock options open fell above the leo what baby out of that sort of like was witnessed by want to turn it off on that was you have the opportunity for i know things like graves uptight there might be out bills that would jump up early on the cool that are doubly you got nerve to outwit smugglers positively more difficult with the rails they're being thought of wedlock and out of likewise already showing by that they're probably going to have feared being carried out on the far side and it like we're talking cover jobs and that as being a page point for this like west wind up that that way it is is quite safe for yourself but you don't have to act over extend for liz theory good aykroyd present you would be to collier jungle and so basically on this plane is he's got a big victory for the bottom and if i had me do it you just waited until a juggler computer then you got a crazy initiated rail setting up for zerbe walk in the window seats evan lobel states that is crap patrol go warped yeah it is now what i'd like to avoid out though he's he's slowly and that replace their feet lot as the theory is as common as their feet as it later she used to rule the flux but he did he play three rolls both calmly hard work but that corralled of not the case here but that these are the authors open for these teams i don't wanna get lucky filled reluctant will be divvied up on the bed is that we've not true regardless that got us in front of a cure for you we emptied out here to cover your son one up one is called mark your your opening her to lucy's gave out for the walkway to be pretty good handle struggles that go to goldman forced penalties for mark has been phenomenal on this champion so that should be a good look at it like this are playing a jury go forward reliant was the guilt opposition gov of support for that have forgot the outlawed that they go to baby through bottom wavered instead of babies they're here aggregate i'm gonna look for those skills you tell us that he brings with it it's about and i actually like this directive distracted or fly quest was a day odell coming in and everyone of the strongest players here bout for the squad and setting him up with confidence with a back room watson was a mistake that it's in right now or you could be a true geary died devlin like this so why did the house to start thinking about how to gauge next and then out what about the author all possible choices there without arms thigh galileo sprawling as you know without start and thighs in fact it's good to my davey there's there's really no word of it in love with our other things that they think of what you're forecasting gauge a lot of them are actually gave the heavy dose of this testicular the board typical forty of them cake decorating flight's late starters also eight feet by those of us deeper problems theaters of isuzu sacrificed for credit ro buys her friends what while our day was dug up by eighteen percent stanza calm cool collected make work figures in the attack the dog what age are towards getting rid of the one that what was that alike their feet don't use like every single one of their feet the bill and feel about what has gone by and you know all that words that he can still see by that easy comes if i feel like a flight for money because they need more attractive misread it has to accounting gauge octave of watson's on the tornado we as well and it's what we used as champions in even with the players that have been struggling for kids and be applauded for there was any indicator that psycho with risk of being to the top wavelengths though and i go for the cumulative effect they didn't like him to come to crumbs time you better be wanted that is if they chose to wait on that linda course we know their guts in russia to the good or not or yeah but the cops so that's not a consideration there for alfonse but is it you know who he might make me look what was a victory was it for ourselves for foreclosure you'll never digger or go when it did that last bit it's likely that there is the gate what you wanna go thinking that you called out without get rid of it is wrong with your toes don't hold on to give these documents the big anarchy to be a good and even if it feels about it all but a lot when i thought about it at a guess that makes a lot that's what was what they're reading here that by the united no possible town again somebody besides sort are the five billion dollars that it hurts yes that is on how far this is literally my favorite scythian that ever seen sort our play which is our platform for me to nestle that all of the palace guard flaking or two in the jungle controlling vision for the team having set up thoughtless thing that makes our caller for the squad what you wanna play king said the end of it that deftly a very viable friday courteous of the ghosts and gave michael smith to leo ultimatum and walled off of a three to try it kills a mexican as one of like myself we get serious then on up when i wrote what style of this so much as sort out was what it was a b. and keep the clicked simo seven misfortune see mouth that misfortune t. f. that diaz that block in the end that update the awards lionheart sold lots dyslexia to use them especially for that to this and that the roster sort are not use their newswires while the so yes we all want him story on it is indeed a bit later here it means camille and have recorded his old image for flight was pointed out to be coming out old or young inserted as well we usually see the moonstone serafin the lives of partially everything that the bill received broke like these and all was a together and it was displayed for the fact he's not the primary to be gave the plot that over the top as you look really good yes i'm in about a big deal of really really create areas that they think it's rolls if you could make it work with the stone fromm is that cigarette and the stands for about start out with your knocked out so that that would that be an exciting one year clear top side carry it for flight west with a jungle had grim and top second meal so top final of the map is to be very important them about maybe we even see some level winds try to set up for deeper vision in this high enough that for the jungle so that speak up there that would air raids in those plants as because the more the most active john was that we've had in the lcs that they'll i consider it so we have guys like bladder closer hear about it being very very bright but yes begin has really been outstanding super super strong tumbler glad you could finally figured out that they wanna play with a big this guy could be on a roster for for years and years and years and to lydia cornerstone player and in a zigzag before gents like to begin with the best performing player of the assembly for the last of four month right now count the world again again to be you're really put into the woods he's that he's really been phenomenal looking for do what he did you on this first big juliet yell to the perfect weekend but no buts miguel stubby opie on because he is very very good i know what see how much the roses roster comes together excuse them with with four new players its began elder roster round him and you're so far they have a quarter final exit they lost a cloud nine the first round of the loch imply austin and that was the end of the season of the doubt to wait and see what the game you know informer for the b. definitely want the regular season and in the hope so hard that was the well with the hopes are they be ready to fly off if either way and these invitational what we are on the red now it's likeness of rebuild their roster as well that were on reporting a lot of lcs voted for you want to escobar also an organization that always have kind of wine eyes looking off into the distance towards international success part of the reason that they have done this multiple times within the vessel want to pick up a shock collar for the team sort are deftly the most accomplished of any of those attempts that they've been trying to go with the outcome is three top of the world finals lives with every game now that's a lcs is actually started outpost walk in accounting towards those international bends towards qualification to represent the north america these other ones were there really give away all out on the line let's see what both teams have learned that from the early stages which side is to be bottom side it's start for both of them heading up towards the pot smoking like matchup of that yet tumblers on the bottom side means to limit and our top side agreements bob you're lookin' at right now monsieur of shenanigans you do look of greek at about one clear which is not likely but i guess possible trouble start they're proposing be out of the big at the head of the chooses to elaine jobs and a whole lot with all that's what that really pressure so the jury mediocre serfin on what that's the only the decision he's ever bought doubled over lost its or art but again the role models and it is also a way that people time's cover of the other was slow growth killer but fighting is what he needs it we are the white house you're not the strongest mobile one take doesn't quite awful lot so dublin will see on the back with beauty of them must want what was the god knows what the the f. now i wanna talk a little bit out who these things like specific because they're the reason i was then so much against him when he was in his prime is a big difference between a view of some of the other lcs king once that we've seen not play aggressively early on with this champion i love game points early level one hour we always tries to make use of this trial by fire that passive at well why does so much for you so he sets up five barrels in the bronze to try and use the refreshed his passive costly goes to stack of his grasp rocks siding with you that is that you see he had a few observers but he gets the view was that he gets another explosive there's a nice job by him zaragoza were small engaged trade off on some of them over as these endeavors a plot of all balkans considered one of those don't know thine and so does that mean it's on lost six look book but this to vicky que le gone back of johnson by the way used to eat dairy and not guardian sophie regarded by he be much safer gets the job is to get the shield law and that battle all outgoing richard nixon eight damage in the ballot and that it would carry the border po box are these bit higher the image which you may be did you want but those big abel lobbied you dive regardless quick wait here for power the old forty four out of twenty five bottles yes very very good at is what he could take down he's going to disperse greek all and so it's a damn reset your burrows they got the bottom side to try and get their mom you know for the for the response is probably see that the all-star away near forty of them has controlled sample so we get this walk straight across made i have that doubles go grab for itself on this to leah is why you skipper crowds auxiliary does goes right into raptors upward to stop side opposing nafta there with thirty eight is able to pull off the doubles the autocrat here that they said over jose heat is heading straight to his respond promptly don't actually lose a lot of time five aces in taking into account his way back that's like it before we set out radiant you are the earlier that the image that was sword and it is therefore the response of the crop you wanna try it you will secure forehead from these one of the central kiri points for this that that as we said instead select the hacker i'm the camille the big gary bauer here for likewise bottom wayne theory cc have you working for more supportive plays now we see multiple roles coming out as a sort artist made one of which did not have fallen by private they have the vision preexisting here forty of them as or are they got on his first act that you see down here flightless or running a spanish girl's dream of the lcs throughout the entire here you can see leads down below twisted he's lifelike was if you wanna keep track of that and want to non non english no they're the ramallah so it up and ion and as a yes it is managed by the recovery of identical in return i want to tell us it's with a double brides do leave you spotted by war around the news coming yet but either way well played whiteness of a very very small bowl the breakdown of the kyodo always the meet was speaker right now and at the start that is a piece out yet now that he hears that size of slugger if everybody's got teleport available can join by paul potts burning that glass with the past absorber is actually really big hats or eon already have to worry about five
