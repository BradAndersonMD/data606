for the postseason means that fourth place is important because of you finish the low for thin that 5th or 6 plus one loss in the postseason and you're out and so you really want to take advantage of that you knows quasi double-elimination and snag a top for a spot so big important for both of these squads of the hit Champion Select the eight and five flyquest against the seven seven Immortal for the calls are fifth and final game of the day thank you very much. You're welcome back to be Pastor desks plural I think is a lanai each have one and that's how it's going to work out here flyquest slated to go for in 200 to close out the season solo back in the mix that has every single roll accept a claim has been subbed out at some point this season so long is the first toppling sub busy or whatever else actually replacing the play than what they stop laying still it was the only topping replacement isn't she thinking Viper unfortunately has not been having the kind of year we were really hoping right yep he has had I think I'm pretty rough split overall he had had a couple impressive people are always going to look through his performance is because he's so damn good on that champion but his strong performances have been few and far between solo despite the fact that he hasn't been in the LCS was I think it's solid performer for a long time when you had from playing so I am interested what kind of level he is going to bring to your today against the dude that guy. There's something to the eye test with a K had a great Reuben game but you are a little into below-average top winter and yes record supports that again it supposed to go for a know they are probably death is a tie-break DSM at the end of the season and if it 1/3 best team and you have a 6 best top laner quite obviously a below-average performer still looking definitely do really well here I have high hopes for him I think he's a very good player I want to see how well he does it again snowy to his then I think overall it right point for immortals who are currently in playoffs session there currently a loan in 5th at 7 and 7 we'll see if they tie fly Emoji at 874 third orbit I have four five six seven eight that's the goal right try to move up and keep Pace with like West look towards that potential top for Myrtle says you say in a pretty good spot to eventually make playoff but they've got to close out these games has been criticism from their way about quality wins you do are all these winds really impressive one was it so deserve but at the end of the day I'm Mortals I think have been improving week-over-week I've been able to come together and make it work with a roster that people had very low expectations for coming into this with almost everyone had a mortal's 8 9 10. Time to test drive it and ends again I think they are looking fairly way out to your actually it's funny I am looking at what their last game against flyquest was which was their first game of the season Viper and Viper to longer on the team at least not starting right now as the Morgana coming through supposed to be running after shot doesn't get the extra armor Mr and you landed behind just like the guy it could be way more dangerous look for those engages as we're gone because not only can a black shield being caged but you are jumping in a straight line and the animation is long enough that you should always be able to hit the binding on the record and then this is locked him down to take him out Aqua is it very experienced work on a player really I think one of his best Champions we have seen him and follow in the past about Lamer United playing a lot of things like Caitlin Morgana as an answer to his Ira Khan so just a little bit different let's still the same kind of principle applies then also a cacique arthas band out once more so maybe kind of moving up the gears as far as the Sprint have been going because we stopped last game and out this Alfred mind at the T in both like what is physical heavy we know if you we can play a lot of stuff and it says hey you don't probably get to play a physical damage mid laner if we're getting rid of Tarth is here for the grass as far as I can tell it's still up there are still two magic damage sources if you really need it look there's the hover if not a big surprise there but yeah I kind of damage that you want so that's a relief Force different item purchases exactly it might as well if you're having a really good game you spell think me the jungle but you don't threaten the Hi-Health Frontline ER and that's why you need a consistent PP damaged or the Victor will give them just that I get the great year for the elite it is going to be blind so we'll see if I can grab something to try to abuse this matchup but a couple midlane dance I've already been thrown out by flight worried about in that Monday 1 to will be Casio end right. This is actually more of a Victor favorite matchup they both can scale the Victor outrageous and had severe Wayfair especially once you have the key laser upgraded you can poke a CEO from router for range with Yuri and look to kind of get control of the minion wave they're all right we'll see if it's going to work out as weak ass if he is going to hope the scale and and do well as when the more, jamming for Erica is third pick of the chance of evil I like composition I always liked set vairocana to get this very very strong overall lot of good things to do there. This is the only not Cloud 9 if he candidate may be Broken Blade that was kind of it as well but it was so obvious. How's the rest right he was almost dragonfly button the top three and I wonder if I could I would love their to be a real site for sex plays the end we no seen on can't be caught but I want to see that fly Quest. Send ballots so likely here and a solo just turn that knob a little bit more if I was it a little bit better as a team that's exciting I want you to do well like Wes looking even better they have been a pretty surprisingly strong teams are out this split I do like their composition a lot more as far as this draft is concerned I think Immortal really all kind of struggle they fall behind it all because they very poor ways to start a fight you're engaged is essentially a trundle pillar of Morgana finding which is not reliable where is on the other side like what desserts are started with more options to make things happen on the road pretty sure as is usual we take our 5-minute commercial break before the game starts hurting so we'll see you very soon but after this get the snacks good job keep it up keep it up I like your idioms hello everyone and welcome back to the show it is our fifth and final LCS game of the day I am still free that was still has a low but now it is League of Legends it's all you came here for anyway flyquest slated to be a top-three TV the end of the split I am looking forward to potential tiebreaker Theus m per second that's going to be exciting Immortals right now in playoff position and they can hold out of that with a win here they are tied for third I'll be huge for a mortal sin we talked about preseason expectations based on their roster on people think they won't really be able to match up there and have a big threat but they have been looking good Smithy I think this guy is so impressive how is he able to just succeed on all these different teams and no on Immortals when you're looking at the roster player by player it's shocking to think that have oral sex with a head of steam liquid his old Squad who replaced him in the playoff race like West on the other hand they to you know what have been doing very very well it started out incredibly hot cooled off a little bit but I'm excited to see are they going to be able to step it up even more his team with upgrades right like the lcf. Hardwick Smith he's no longer the first place but you know he he found some new teammates and he's a game-and-a-half ahead of Seattle right now true if you just had it replaced all four of them didn't replace him I like to hook up with you right now know Wheatley got better stuff on here is what the second most all-time LCS trophies right he's passed Pearson only SS and you know who his new old team making playoffs would be out for the squad I think that would be a very impressive run for Mortals I know that is what they are focused on that is what flyquest is focused on picking up every single win that they can you put themselves
