but it all comes down to how you play on the day and there's a Top-O-Matic right on your screen and it's lickerish it's hot there they're both excellent players and begin to pick some dance at Golden Gardens locations they want to be able to pull off some up that's here because we said we was supposed to be there this week they're going up against it and I do believe hundred thieves as well as to the teams that are expected to be near the top of the table so expectation for Golden Guardians there staring down the barrel of a 0-4 start which is really not where you want to be this is supposed to be the Revitalize reason for all that is going to get to them to playoffs after if the two very rust flips in a row where they finished tenth place this one fell through the victim Bears early on so 442 made up the topping to try to carry later on it so far we are not seeing these Champions Banda waste a lot of here and rise from before are still up but beyond will get rid of Aurelia a call he's already gone castreally almost anyone take that chance except for Griffin movies with anyway but that's the elaboration across the rest of the week to flex it as much as you can plan around that work early but definitely going to have to be worried about the ergot is a champion that can be Flex around quite a lot here a lot of people that were throwing some shade his way for a role in it down a little bit in their loss on the dude early bird Raven definitely had driven band against him I think was actually both games yeahcontract is already so far so he has played back-to-back head real game not sure if he's going to want to go for that salad mashup if you do want to just play to farming out to play safe and couldn't go for something like that but it can be pretty dangerous playing some of the more for the short-range rolling out South Champion so maybe simply the third straight as real game here for me and I think that's what we're getting around certainly priority is taking their turn. You know what that's okay you do what you want I do for the interstate so far across 9.2 leaves going to be third most contested Smuggler behind a strong sense that's wanting a child support and he definitely has a lot of bands but this one is also pretty common one either way Lee still going to be up here yet again and it will be too early game aggressive fighter junglers here with Camille facing upLaura slightly somewhat but still shaping that I think it's been since place by chance I would expect of that I'll be your got certainly do could go either way mid or top LeBlanc be winded we may simply PBR got to admit I've seen a lot of players precum fertile end of that matchup simplify rushing the cowl tag marketing positioning be pretty banking at least neutralize claims against me with walking But Rising to be taken away we may see some more band started to work any potential Midland power picks against fairy numbers standpoint forgot to take his Boards of physical do you know lots of armor for a champion and I just tend to be good against a deferredand I think taking whey an aggressive before that can really enable the greatest to really shine if it makes a lot of sense + Olay know when you do think about a lot of his best games they are usually on those aggressive play Make Her Say something back to his Immortals days we was really I'll look at as its play making guy lots of thrush lots of Morgana finding this picture is team being that aggressive player warband out as well here waiting at last band will be will it be another word for he's mine Zanesville was a big Alistar Mains but all I could easily take that away before you get to doing it would you go for Target man like I'm working on it instead specials Draven Morgan to get no stye on dropped off they of course know that gold ready to pop later that's fine I can we put the girl got there if they need to do to put in something takes sign off the table and away I mean if you are comfortable playing there are got top or God is definitely a strong mashup into the Scion but final Rose is such a solid pick and does give him a really powerfulwines are perhaps they're just trying to eliminate any potential Frontline to make it easier to dive onto Champion such as the grave in such as the block removal out-of-state fees there no with that big Frontline sign would provide can we just get the second Victor game for housing or picked up a force which naturally on he's played a couple of Mages and well go to the gardens vandalize themselves back in the Victor here and didn't feel good and licorice who plays Victor with a lot of your game out of monster but still the 3rd mate now for him as we assume that's going shopping now if it's Raven or what's going up there. In in the matter but you're more comfortable with the counterfeit the other Lane and go I'm also really in to see if there's a chance of getting an AP garbage here that is a champion that scene was going to be hotly debated so you feel like it is very powerful as far as an aggressivepeople out if you want to play that Draven aggressively dropping those flag for the pope also giving you additional tax because I work there but obviously if you want to keep driving safe contents turn we allowed to do that until we can accomplish the same thing in different ways because you have this pumpkins behind you you can then play much more forward you can step up aggressively trading knowing that I'm going to save you and I think it also is a nice answer to something like this do we break the chomp someone off out of the TV bubble double in and really the earth safe for the one cuz I have to have to have you do not have hard and Gabe outside of really tricky things like pumpkin fighting a back line and contrast been kind of a text flash so getting in on the Poke team could be hard like it puts a lot of pressure on fragen to Sandhill answer this with the Distortion Fordham if you are that could be difficult for gold guns you play out the mid-to-late game but Will Smithlooks like denied have it or got top bet against Victor up there and we have two of us really am done with early game keep fighting I do think once you hit sticks on a lot of these characters if Draven is winning Lane as expected you can play around fought with champion likely thin and the LeBlanc while it's hard to engage if they have eyes on you have a second to no dragon test or that sort of area you can certainly when those bikes you can certainly take pics around there so we'll see if both parties is able to get that sort of curly game advantage and still both at in Jacksonville has a similar style of game plan as we saw echo-fox attempt last time it was going to be a fun one to watch what I think's wrong shieldwolf brakes but they don't bounce off a projectile so there's a lot that I think could do here to really break think the farted I was going to drop the Raven ultimate that won't do anything anymore. His victory you can prevent LeBlanc 4-person the back linerhow to prevent be aggressive aggressive plays out of Golden Gardens but could be very important Cloud 9 1 and 1/2 liquid they look very sharp golden Guardians a week start of the season but they could certainly do well here with a new lineup we are on the rent and you get a win against C9 here and the team could certainly get reinvigorated from that and see if you can beat C9 then maybe they're going to look a lot better against others to use the certainly a lot on the line for Golden Guardians I feel like in particular but really both the squatsokay we are on to this one let's see what comes through across contract now for several years in a row has been off Cloud Nine 50 against them that was all of last year didn't quite have the results you would have hoped but once again against his old team got it was a bit of a surprise honestly when he did depart from Cloud 9 such a promising young juggler and know a lot of people did think he had a bright future with Cloud 9 but then moving over to Golden Guardians Pine obviously haven't had a lot of success with send Aaron and you did last year throughout the summer split a lot of fiber and you know some people are still wondering will he start making it through rotation because why else was here and I think in international play oh yeah it did look very good during the regular season ended up solutely so it's up to watch for as well keep on going and don't spend quite good starting play no games here as well for sissies look pretty good don't get me wrong it's not a scene I need to change this but I was a very deep bench on that roster at 7 to watch the fourth time goes on I better start Salisbury like to hear foreseen I do when I think what AN 415 at the very beginning of their season other summer split boys look to in one here either way we will wait to see what happens to see Red Lobster at least taken by both these jugglers and that also applying for some lame priority up here a little bit faster to get out of the map Fest at least it's actually from Braum really is always such a nicely Swiss classic rock to Stone there is going to help you a lot and it's red straight top side Scuttle here for Spence Karen to see if he then tries to take that down to the boat's I didn't try to do a double Scuttle route or if he just wants to secure themselves one shuttle Canal on his phone's out of map with lyrics pushing you already nice stuff there for licorice q and W looking pretty good here in about 1/2 HP liquor has been really good lately Better Living snaps but some of that is Champions played may just had to Farwell in the early game who would have thought General often are going to have a nice Advantage rashly know when you are playing a lot of these klepto style Champions as we speak he was playing in the early weeks to get something like a Scion are you are expected to get a pressure of energy for expected to get a bit of a farm please please do so far pretty uneventful early-game we are tracking the jungle path slightly here is not directly send out a cast on his bottom side looks left up part of the only took a part of them get level 3 on this and be ready to go to fight for more of this jungle and honestly think I'm going to split the scuttles 121 but also from researchers intuition is going to have to be to deny a lot of the would-be Gophers been scared isn't really good path for Tasha yes really really really so good to take that away from his opponent look at the actual decide to try to look for a diabetic it would be very hard to talk to take down the aisle prom and the Ezreal so I'm backing off for now drop the ghost portal down there for a long time no use does not the champion that could have been me the chance to fight right there except what to name is right there if it lands there's no way of course bleach down but just the ticket warrant was certainly attract Spencer Knows okay six cans I know it's against those were and it's going to be more total allowed XP and gold to contract as you slowly go to the rest of the Jungle yeah and enforcement lessen the situation where it's very obvious what you going to do now there's no Camp stuff on the map they know that they know now that you're going to be out there looking for a gank looking for a vision so the golden Guardians Lanes now have to play with some respect towards that knowing that there's no real other option he's going to look for a Game Spot Lane to go towards Scruggs you do it was taken and there's a ghost for that's going to see him and you like okay we know Camille has bought Lane she walked right by that pay ping ping ping deal with red circles down there they are well aware but if milk is too which means they know what we're kabila's they have been tracking Spence going right now so he will be playing back enough they know Hunter safe up here and pretty both back and forth a very slowly to the Victor Camille could be a Willie anticipate that he's actually in to do some counter jungling of his own remains to be seen as I use it looking towards do now is there a wait might be able to push him off this but yeah right now where's the team got some damage totally wrong and always got to be there as my phone for Stuff Latin events Karen will there be more it's a sleeping LeBlanc that was brilliantly Garden City good job of tracking Spence Karen as I said that they would know what he had to do with that level 3 cavile comes up and I'll wait 5 hours so incredibly well you did not get that kills get the hookshot is not stop identify get there with the loss gets for the thing. No way to get out so we dropped nearly flash but definitely is on the roam washes in contract flash Cube and the bullet hits of a round of Brom and take them down and basil going to go down as well get in there that might have been a second feel but yeah I'll never be happy about how this went all right good stuff here golden Guardian 302 head feeling pretty good momentary Top Lane Advantage do not elect directions to old fellow covers with night and start playing after which again because of the wards down and going to look okay Sprint store in Ellicott wounds. Still have more camps far but use the XP difference quite large 524 the advantage of contract if you want to go to the police in right now sitting with that first blood it's going to be pretty nice when he does go back to base and spend that up already has enough full for a call fieldston I would certainly
