things you can exploit people on leave up that mordekaiser I don't think he play the orange but maybe you do pull it out just to stop him from being able to to play that as a stable pick Center hit the band table first stop in Champion Select we're going to head right back over to freaking Kobe though to get us into our second game of what could be a very long day thank you very much and I'm excited to finally fit in a small window on my monitor and I can Austin area is left for us and yes there are three a minimum the tiebreakers on The Dating the tops to follow the road that goes and is pray that he zhi does work meanwhile psmo beef tendon with that little speed bump for themselves now they might be starting to sweat a little there's another champion that was at the heart of it last NFL EOS pick up that was that was a tough one coming in will see if that same performance shows up yet again going to make you wish you hadn't Guess My Number One Step Players Bar stage games that we've seen very good to go after affiliates with a champion a Philly host but it has a really easy time of dunking someone to go over to a family has Broken Blade isn't very good with flashing getting facebreakers on the back line so I think I just is going to cause a little bit of trouble for Johnson is going to have to be very cognizant of his positioning and that of his Frontline so that Broken Blade doesn't use his own steam spaghetti back there and kill him Beyond or anybody was really impressive that border guys are flights so Jo Frost by The Four Tops yeah you any idea that's definitely up there it's try to get it back there to to be a belly also probably involves price to you, which is kind of weird because a lot of the time by Owl frogs has played Super aggressive support but it has been a very good job of farming up for those teeth by yeah they should help them really really well the the you be alongside someone like that where you know she loves riding on Camilla Champions you both know there's a lot of CC available there someone to get back to Johnson on a Philly Austin even though Tom ketchel them that you need a giant play so as soon as they're failures pops back out you can bop them on the head like one of those carnival games play a very standard front-to-back team finally going to go out and it would be a great option there yeah and honestly Zoe is a very good blind pick Blanc are literally the two most popular on on the last like three patent liners but with them being removed it does bring up the Beltway slack victim act up once again all right here is a very standard brick by releasing something yep early game aggressive that's going to be at 8 in front of make the difference in the early games and now there's an answer listen to make slaves so let's hear for reaching a bit for me for I mean set is fairly difficult to create place on because of the Regeneration the possibility of Duty 1 ending with a shield with the bait mean well as real and you me very difficult for at least we did track down and maybe we'll go for some jungle 21 jungle pressure because we've seen with the extra Mobility can definitely crate good skirmishes versus the stage 1-e if the state doesn't have step right next to jack up the passes quicker just now coming up right here I believe 10 wins does not guarantee you top four because egn none of these can join that as well but it really makes it easier to get there it's going to be exciting to watch for right now dignitas playing for their playoff life TSM try to move up in the standings getting top for obviously pretty useful their overall self commercial break for competitive Integrity of a champ select is done so stick around back right here with game 2 and they say I have a grim sense of humor hello everyone and welcome back to the show The Ultimate or pedals but then we have a s m r Covey as well as regular old annoying listen to David free and it's going to be a great buddy to Kobe I'm excited for Ledo X going to do great what exactly is M vs. dignitas into these team fight monster safety here for the backline a zero self field Israel has self peel you me on either of those carries can greatly support the backline like you talked about in champ select can help out with the engage for either dardarkom broken plates 02 very clear game plan here want to get those five-on-five group set up stage of the game meanwhile dig with the little last pic kind of curveball of the lease in maybe they try and force you know some skirmishes or something to make this pic worth it because otherwise Leeson will get out of jail by the state Sewanee heading to five on five then to try the group up and it's going to really Force Acadian to reach for some really big plays some insects may be in our future to to have some value there okay okay. Do you know what looks like no leash here for Kaden on the red that's not going to be too difficult for him broke up with no going to help start off being the true homie could help police that Red Bluff up their wrap up start the book jumper I like how they're actually Tru homies to if you watch any of the DSM content. Dakin broken played really good friend Stars really funny to watch a little interaction super outgoing and those two in game on the rift is it have also been a big part of tsm's Victories to trying to get across their team fights for them and this time around you'll have the same the same duties right Broken Blade looking to get to the back line trying to take down 80 carries start off trying to engage on those fights for him mess with a poop comes out there Johnson does have a lot less to stay in early gone with the 16 nurse there a lot less healing on out several 4.6 rather 10.6 so that pokes going to matter quite a bit and he was very very slowly sustained backup Rover by take some nice layout and I do like seeing or players lose so it is more doable now to do something early in Lane because of the nurse to the Democratic brittle proc but it doesn't seem like we have seen that really abused since 10:00 6 day of 10.6 came out and I'm still kind of waiting for it
