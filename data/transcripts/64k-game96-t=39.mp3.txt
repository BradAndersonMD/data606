that they had picked themselves into against Cloud9 the analyst just talked about this as well as ale mention yeah I'll take this key on Veigar and blabber on Tinder because that's not a dominant early-game mid jungle Duo so I wonder how much of this draft is going to mirror what we saw in game 1 of the first three bands it's identical yeah I do the things that I would definitely not Trey. I don't think cloud 9 has a strong reason to change things up I am curious if life was felt like any of Cloud 9 pics were incredibly terrifying and his ear is what cloud 9 wants to give little respect to this baby doesn't Force the mountain Veigar as their example counterpick let's say so that will be okay with Cloud 9 can I Rush pick a champion knowing that if you want me to counter or don't have to you know set up fans around that being a steel in popularity during this class because you had two games Word game one had identical pants to get into but I don't think they should ever happen because even the winning team could learn something from game one with which this week and I think Cloud 9 in this game are the ones who deviated from the plan first scary game so you are a very similar the question is what can fly fest going to come through and if they're going to empty on shows up as well but do they price of Pantheon now right now this Cloud 9 News black bus will take it early isn't that cloud 9 would take on Bluetooth reset that mean it's like as the graviton read to what's really interesting here is even though set is already locked in that doesn't necessarily mean Cloud Nine already has their top later so if like what does it take corn here I could totally see Vulcan playing on Keystone set support and actually take an order on this rotation as like West Valley defender of which was banned in game 1 okay and it means they move around into account or mashup McGregor that is the band that cloud 9 let's when they put as beer on the list thing okay are answers to this Champion is going to be out to a gragas and they instalok is it's likely going to be the mid jungle even though it's possible that that is a bot Lane combos where if you do get hit by even a grand ultimate level 6 you're probably going to die it'll be really interesting to see how how much the insurance has to babysit for power of evil to keep him in this game and he's going to be a couple of bands most likely is Cloud Nine oh no they have a decent jungle matchbook and toss those things out of darts and the additional thing here now is it Cloud 9 doesn't have the 80 karrie pick so we can go Fairly far down then champion pool obviously varis in Dawn Santa is banned affiliate is gone he played Miss Fortune last game which has pretty good rotations in good Teen Titans an incredible the second most prized. Later is empty in there as well so yeah but shows right to ban is where they put the pants on that's enough come through as well but it is also very compelling so but I do want to see if those come through because then he's not playing it a lot champ doesn't have it in the tank empty does will wait to see if horse the band is coming through okay yeah and actually I don't know if that if that is actually toppling set based on the fact I'm just thinking through if they do pick like an Israel Twitter bot like they would for on having too much physical damage because gragas would be the only a piece dress but if they do Calista set bought they're going to pick her right now and their compositions going to be a lot more balanced I think that's what we're going to start at Galaxy brain it's Calista stop timer boss test for I'm not serious but it still possible to the bottom line something up there okay so they're going pretty heavy in physical damage here gragas being there only magic for a set second Super open I'm kind of sad for not seeing all these Stones supports that cuz I need to be an armed guard out of the syndrome of the you mean it's not that easy to build armor on a Philly so she wants to go through item guardian angel with will be hard to kill and ignorantly hard to kill but if I just want to kill backline first they can still realistically take down Tower of evil and wildturtle in most team fight and it's going to be 5 at that point we'll see what happens if there is some more let's see them than just that and there is that little bit of vegetable platter has but we're solo ignorance and Torrence to get will still being a moderate damage breast with items like throwing Mills on fire cave yeah and I also think it's really interesting how a fellios has trended throughout the playoffs because there was definitely a time during these playoff swear you were just prevent no one was willing to let him through but that's also went on Kent wasn't getting banned because you could still stay the affair Leo's turtle is very much alone afelio Sandlot these fights what does make him vulnerable to getting jumped on a special order talking about stuff like set Caracas Yasuo that is just so much stuff to kill turtle with it's going to be a journey in this next game it is going to be a journey and of course welcome back to our ESPN audience the game is about to begin and we have a very exciting graphing this one is going to be closed for the Cloud 9 side and also that's bendre very highly prized Jackie the fellas well there are two huge power pics on the flak westside of there going to be very pleased to use here and we're going to go sell some of the game in just a second and honestly the first 50 minutes flyquest had a great start send torrent plus eggnog together combined her first blood pressure all around the map the Cloud 9 did get better mid-game that rhymes with new one I want the same thing can happen and I just want to make a quick note for the viewers about these player cancer we're seeing in for the purposes of competitive Integrity the whole stream is delayed till the coaches can't on live see what's happening on a stream or something so everything is pushed about a five-minute delay the player cams last game became undelayed due to a bug show that is hopefully fixing this game and it should be synced up what you're seeing on the player cams and what you're seeing in gameplay for this game pause the video feed and is it okay to respond to the game I pause the video of boomstick it up and it was an editorial choice to show that cloud that is so good that from that lead they can win 0 v v I think that was actually cannot see what happened in the game that the players are telekinetic and just use the keyboard to buy some across across the room for the game probably not. I can walk away taking less damage and that is honestly it is Flash burned but their exhaust and he'll using the Cloud 9 side mount boat and yet again feel comfortable and off that early play just might ignore his cheating it they don't get the better side of it and change it to Blue Steel honestly don't think that santorin cares that much about his blue being stolen or for thinking about Camp one timings there's actually going to be a slow start for blabber the more important thing is the Summoner spell usage in it is 242 however I think hexflash users like Alistair or much more free to burn their flash early because if they have brought control they still have a lot of phone to an Xbox of course it makes them more vulnerable and reactive situations in terms of Getting ganked By but for all the action the output is still I think a relatively close. brighten the lack of black doesn't matter for offense but it matters to the defense because that make you say okay what is blaberus Pathak because the obvious retarded is on ignorance head at the chances that you can kill if you find something to do on it so you look at that I was passing he's so blue took Raptors ran to his left side jungle I think he will probably recall and it's clear box pokespot Lane with Predator boots and and that might be where she puts impression will see that can happen to game 2 in game 1, 9 had stronger pushing Toth and bought leans but they were pushed in in Midland so they couldn't really take control the map they have an opportunity here we're all their Lanes can be pushing and blabber want to play very aggressive although at the current moment people pushed into overtime from Hunters towels went to Seven health in townsmen last hit it been torn away so quarter 2nd for one more Auto before Smita got me now he's actually going to a double scoped previously it didn't matter what he actually based on his past would have been able to get level 4 off of that Scuttle crab now he's still sitting at level 3 laverkin take both shuttles and Central and has to farm his little meal from that is a bit of a tragedy that is a very tiny Miss play that you very rarely see but it came up do 3 Camp recall to pick up boots to have the gang threat laboratory much more of an aggressive full clear actually going to go for a bit of an aggressive trade that bottom Lane is going soundly in the favor of course the trash the closest rest is extremely potent as a Duo more so then the afelio Salas respectfully Master doesn't have the defensive tools to be able flash away so it did that kind of white even more crucial that santorin didn't get control if I had those cattle crabs it means he can't provide any assistance to that bottom leaning has been involved in or going to start may be running away with it but I want one of a couple of small details of how licorice plays this match be seen a lot of Tetris Orem games and there's a couple of similarities that it seems like licorice us every single time so what is he always takes a very early Rico for Kohls actually sustain life on it is better to take the W for Wednesday look like new auto tag off of the W charge cuz that is like at the end of the Orion combos Wii steak on the damage he sets up the shields that he blocks most of that when the percent Health damage auto tag comes in and uses that animation to guarantee that his own W is in a land for damaged it's a nice display watching licorice play through this matchup you can see one of the reasons why he's so confident playing this in two games in a row and especially if we're tracking the the mid and late game the biggest thing about Statin those devices where he can land his ultimate there was a moment at the end of game 1 worth liquor straight who took 60% of Pee-wee's house because you all possess solos orange back in to peel easier so that's the Top Lane and then down bottom Wayne the things are in complete control for Cena and you can that bought land pressure to pick up the first rake good game well played from Vulcan throws up the candy heart and that is first break yet very early on as well I am always impressed of a team can I think that's the mark of a lot of bottling controlled speaking of which one TCS lead for his vent and Vulcan as a player but first time of the year and is absolutely sure could be a going to have a blast it look like I talk it over the wall by the devil wears a black couch and watching back as well as some of his back can bring them if needed end of the day it's still a flash down to wild turtle Patrol of Dogtown for Vulcan it doesn't mean they won't be targets down the stretch I think as we mentioned wild turtles going to have a charger on his back pretty much this entire game flyquest even though the goal was even is way more on the back foot right now than they were during the early game of game 1 Yep this is a good as a pretty good start all things considered at least relatively for cloud nine going to feel pretty solid the farm still going through will get pet the solo who has left the match there but he's actually help substantially lots of the map on the orange Midland Lot close the last time around and has before has been feeling really don't want the bottom line for the player who didn't have an LCS team during the offseason subbed in towards the latter half of the split split time with the other top laner before becoming basically the full-time starter after flyquest was knocked down two losers bracket so it's been quite a ride for Solo in he is still performing a very high-level against licorice definitely has goes up and take some honey fruit catches back up in health and Mana
