communication is extremely important as his removing clutter from Ponce right you know you if you want to communicate everything that is important without all the extra garbage that can sometimes then and make it very confusing the important calls and cool-downs that are actually being used in and monitored by the weight JJ certainly has impressed so far but there have been critics of flyquest still you know they are sitting at the table table tied for first 6 and 4 but a lot of their wins have looked somewhat shaky they have been picking up wins that perhaps they shouldn't have gotten based on the game State you know he was last week against how to use they were literally behind hundred views from Austin to and then boxes the Space Race wear plaid was barely wins out is there are still some questions that would be very impressive to see them get a win over a top speed will be nice to see of course the question was sort of Romaine does Xbox count as a dominant team right now with a lot of the roster shaken up I think the month has been very very goodexpects me to be quite incredible I did see his foot up last week talking about his transition from cloud and Echo Fox News bed I lost a lot of confidence in the game changed the whole lot I no longer knew what we could always take advantage of what do I do when I got a lot quieter are you kind of lame a little bit of himself in the game is as part of the opportunity once again to start on the LPS station will see if he feels more comfortable now in the middle of week 6 into Newton per and you know this is a team that they have very different want or need from his. Calling abilities when you look at Pony and doc say to me I have always been friends of the flagship view of echo Fox Lair of the guys that are often dictating the pace of the game calling the shots doing what they want to do in the rest of the team is working at this building at playing around them we'll see if that changes with me if he can step towards which. Calling rollremember this braid happened a couple days ago right that has not been long. It's not like they were on Academy Ave no practice really you have to think besides the last couple days so as it do that could take some time to polish up as well know things to watch for hear 50 seconds ago for the beginning of the band face I want to point out that flame has soft counter picks himself with the moon do in the gang slang defeat the big pick up to counteract that one for skinny on a fairly comfortable high damage character here playing with themselves being the gang all over here either way we have the Kindred picked up early for Santorum that could look very very good fortune for JJ puts a lot of power in his hands and I think he's been mostly good decisions here on the LCS State game on the on the wrong end of this matchup you know a couple of times and he actually did lose the match of his DPheavily we had all those eat Sunday, play the opposite side and went on that side too very heavily on his defeat right now you know certainly I would say that it is very well get a farm leading and have maybe a little bit of pressure or whatever but it's more about just getting to his items and then taking over where the muto certainly can win in the early stages and I was down one item can actually have an opportunity to bully to GP lot of it comes down to how well do using the barrels who's winning the Mini-Game of the last hit on that Barrel in a lot of things like that and that's one of the character I think the quote I heard was like any other Champion right now that it was going to be very good pickets in the game so happy. Into it. Catch down there we don't know their jungle in mid just yetlast week I was playing TV in the Darius with 30 or 40 minutes before things kind of started going bad in that one do you want and you know if the flame who has not been performing as well it does kind of get isolated there with honey. That could spell some bad things for them that being said it's always going to be that through 1 B-1 there is a chance to forward it to me here for JJ house that has the ability to be with the same United to go up to the Top Lane to kind of pylon to Hootie and Tony has been very susceptible to do that while giving up many many kind of isolated death trap is splitting in general does not performing as well as as we have going to come to expect out of money and Camille back in the lineup soccerare they kind of coming back in line of credit in Fort Lee disappeared in the nerves of 8.12 or not lasting like 50 damage at MAX train with a really really big Nerf that ability galio will be home from those dice meal with the GP also named yet it is not the galley Ocampo but GP Oliphant layers extremely well over that Camille ultimate also and it's someone who really can't help the lock down and take down the moon do you have enough first of those two Champions to really look to do that but obviously that ends with a global Ultimate Looks to respond with a semi go to Ultimate can also look to respond to and kind of protect do also have to always mention the galio + Kindred ultimate interaction if you actually use that Kendra ultimate early you can find the galley ultimate so that says he is landing right out of that ultimate inGucci Mane is coming out of that lamp to spite you so you can birth people down there cc2 knocked up and that could be tough to deal with you but you can still be sealed as though there's lots of ways to kind of keep alive throughout that game play and we'll see you the one after locked in for them to watch for damaged left hand side out of echo-fox our first look at the new lineup they're promoted Academy kiwibot later in Lost I've got food over from Cloud 9 was sitting in the academy bench down there and back in the starting roster this year if you have a great roster on their own Sky have looked very very good at first place Contender right now they're ready to play our games of League of Legends third game of the day of battle at first place at the fox picking up like Westgoing to be really interesting also you must be kind of look at lost in isolation in this game because yes Academy throughout the split but they are sitting at 2:10 and as a result in a loss is obviously if they're losing all their strong individually but it's sometimes hard to tell how much of that is because it's performing around you and how much of that is you individually not performing that well. He now is is surrounded by too much more known quantities and if he can perform on this level then you can start to think okay well maybe he is very good individually but the team in Academy was just not working of course we'll see if the LCS team to work the third-place finisher from Spring hope to make it very good here at the fox and the rest of the teams can be caught at the studio in Los Angeles tickets are available. Com tickets come hang out with us we love you all very very muchthank you you don't care about me as often apparently there was like four people doing to show your love to prove your love to them everyday talk about League of Legend Oaks school that was available to I put up with the sale I care that much sharing is caring for a kind of match up nicely there you go to Synergy door into the gameI sent are going to be starting his buff still on the top side and a lot of some kind of come down to if there's a point of conflict is is where that kid rock Johnny exactly what I want on that first Scuttle tablespoons on the bottom side of that is where he's looking to clear to he's trying to avoid any potential interaction with Darla cuz you're expecting garlic to clear trip to the topside and it just one of the but first though there's no point really even even trying he's just actually go over and just do the mark because he's already failed at that point right so you're kind of just putting yourself behind a little bit and is pushing up he will go grab this not irregardless and it's time to see what the response is going to be dark was spotted going into this topside there's a war that it didn't fire it was in the river, but they could look so actually performed I fear of din level three digit do the hookshot though that's actually 12 seconds to go so we're looking at is always an option when I was down and looked at 6 to go for a later dive a general you're trying to actually get that. Happening on the mudo free picks because once stopwatch comes in at eight minutes stopwatch for the ultimate definitely need your undeniable unless it is ridiculously bad situation but very fortunate spawns on these marks already too easy marks both bonding on the bottom side of a map where he had control and he could very easily be sitting at 0 / going to check in with Echo Fox coach think about what's been going on this week thanks guys Aspen card about their newest 80 carrier lost he says that he thinks that loss is an incredibly smart and mechanically skilled player and that just to help with a little bit of stage fright little bit of nerves on stage today he's going to be picking up his comfort pick embarrass back to you guys it's very different playing in front of a crowd like this playing a part of the bigger audience you know there's more pressure so no limits of those variables You Can Depend more on on on the reactions enough to pick through his when he moves when it's like I can't even play all the time all right now though keen on the back foot right here to Monte who's had I think an absolutely Stellar summer split so far with Echo Fox I think it's been mostly all great game that I am here plus nine of us Calliope being shoved away a bit here and Echo Fox 4 and a gold up some of that being Gangplank exist but I'm quite nicely they got a solid Camp lead on tarlochan and a half away for so far Devonte and centaurion trying to sneak around here behind hunie actually managed to avoid all the vision so they could look for this but I think I probably have any play this is fairly low but got up there I was getting play run that one right now is it time to go to the cutest guy he's got nowhere to go for blood picked up nicely done assure that pretty smartly to know he's the only one who can actually really get killed there so he kind of just gets a little bit of damage in them fax off and honestly from santorin avoiding that Ward and be right back into a parked car. It's actually stay decides not to but that is one of the most devastating things I can actually happened to you as a top player in this game is when the wave is a Frozen song Frozen again in to die here it is one more time playing very low nosy kind of fun to try to avoid this Barrel so it's a little bit of damage does that mean you're not going to find a mate for the we get to come through does Donna go on in and out the TV channel flame had at least started know it was actually wildturtle try to join but now it's the chase down if there is no DP electric to go in as well kill in the mid lane that 5 went well have to be careful. he's going to hit six soon Darla has moved his way up here should have been spotted by that Ward and we'll see though I mean out now this is flame retardant also he does have stopwatch a couple minutes but that's not going to be available in the area so his dive likely will go bad if they try it but it was around there they call it off till throw some clippers at minions throw some Cleavers and Tony and lasted most the Restless have fun at the Wake County still maintaining the pressure so again doing fairly well in that isolated 1D one but Falling prey to the game he does like to play very aggressively and see how you have to play to really create does big individual advantages that he can get but that exposes you how to Gangsta and if you don't have full vision if you do not have your keys in there to back you up yeah then sometimes you're giving up too much and you need to know maybe needs to learn to walk that line little bit better I suppose so one thing I want to point out that was a very crucial just timing. Cooney died when he had money for his Sheen I think if he gets back in the latest Bill sapphire crystal that's a very different look when he comes back in and I wish I could take an on-purpose recall this time picking up some more static doran's blade and a dagger I believe both picked up here so more sustained more durability case to another game I would have kind of things back if you want to look at more durability just grab a ruby Crystal and work towards that fade something along those lines because Dorrance + dagger could just be no Ruby Crystal underwater store for that beat Shazam download has more but it does give him more immediate hour if he's trying to kind of brawl fight us again claimed as to who has been known to do he really does like to take those Greta trades that fights for the past hour protocol slightly delayed for me for splits might not mean too much on his side of help you be able to keep in mind that game Plinko is the one Global and foxes side and of course Galley other one Global on flakka West so that is why we have two dogs can wander a donkey
