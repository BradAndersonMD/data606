a lot of this this Top Lane trading who he has gone past has effectuation with the heck rum Creek was all aboard so you know I think it would be sweet if ever Wins Game 5 do you know who sang I want to see whoever gets it you need to take them to Victory their butt sex pill has to offer selection off of that lost that big blue side and now let us see we're going to have for this rap I add you said she's very excited for this one and I'll see if we can make this one go throughyeah cuz there's so much you know there's so many possibilities with 1016 being so fresh on what they will put their time in the first couple games were waiting out in Kettering the galio and then they have to poop or gragas for ignore huge play making from him yet I'm just saying game this series and it was the first time or the double 80 carry back your ass and Caitlin clearly talk to you for everybody's money this opens up more possibilities than I really still like by reekado I think they really well I think especially with our most comfortablecan be used by Banks. He is really looks good on the Senate do in the last couple games yeah maybe regardless of the fact that and look at this Tomcat Jonathan Graves is gone around here they're gonna grab some Bee Gees and all right we're plotting stops is there game 5 come they got Hootie his gang Blake in game 5 for this most iconic Champion hardest Carey performance this year had this on this campus trouble gameplay are the one where you lift me up to the next level to the next year I'm excited see if they can actually pull it out it is flying does that really good Synergy with sedge wani as a melee Champion being able to stack up the done with her and that is been the Resurgence that we've seen a lot of jugglers picking stage running back up especiallyevents in melee solo laners becoming too prevalent and so fly crust going for the lantern, that got sent to thrash locked in there going to leave their Top Lane counterpick for later then I got to go to the pick up yet now I have seen a Lucian Yelp quite become a win for him a different word for topped could go through all those you mentioned the grave stele goes away and Gigi go back to comfort and it's real once again interbankAzrael everybody always falls back to the old days he hasn't had the best win rate in the LCS this split with it but this is a player always a highlight seeing him on it and some sort of extra flexibility to play around that topside like I was making a Szechuan beefless Gangplank convos that's why he's actually really good at helping and guarding against possible dive combos if you go with that type of counter option in 2 Gameplay the ones that want to try and dive him early so you don't actually a really good Defense Force that can fly Quest now we're filling in with support band at this point in time, yes please like supposed to be clear but regardless they're going to throw that banned in there she can't play support Morgana is the band I want to see I think it stays with his homework for this path you make sure you're more Donna was up-to-date he is good against threats. But it's fine to walk the routewhen does the threat of the very least and we'll see if that's what's going to be the second band is Jace is off the table it's LeBlanc band away from goldenglue here as the Corky keep being bad as power of evil alright multiple Support options I actually really curious why we haven't seen no Luck's Copperhead up as much you know she is really prominent ever since you got that buff with a slow for the heat before counterpick yeah I think you are more worried about your being taken away by the power of evil cuz I don't think you have to be that afraid of what comes out of the 4th when your work know the entire Lane you again comfortable there and wait for now it's going to be born again strange and poking out his here are some of the best new tools against this year especially even later on in the game trying to check him out so you can't set up 45 for sand filters and everything they still do you do it and since they have grades as jungle if you don't fall into the Trap of your double AP solo laners being kind of a liability grave bury I-80 threat from the bottom side so I like it with the the double cancer fix your from flyquest from coming in at the last second block out some of the unique about a possibility guano play more for the pope but it means I got a very big Frontline on EG side with a very obvious things by big them to stop playing victim to the mid lane big damage on a box length and spent their own ends diesel are on take Duty have some split push pressure pressure for this is back directions to Port not really there either but it's a lot of focus AP kog'maw flash ghost power of evil should be the one empowered to carry this game is a man people looked at all season long for black West at the end of the day I fly out of being very well-rounded with great players and all their length of a step in the right day they can be that big carry the question is now can they do it in game 5 eg1 to Straight black wristbands are shook but can they pulled over again by and I always want to see a peacock mids attacked early with some jungle pressure cuz the early stages of this Champion are our kind of laughable especially if you compared to the later stages of the game for the Certo yeah and everything for him focusing a lot on yo just clearing meaning waves and at least even trying to get him a single item so with with the jungle pressure maybe you can kind of delay that attack power of evil early on and start there yeah can be fun to watch if that can indeed happen I mean it's going to be spicy regardless I honestly did and I love you all kind of counted EG out and think they were tilted or or Garbage but it's like well like Worcester clue the better team this is going to be expected I'm not sure if each you have it in them and they did game for was tight that got to come back they got the really really nice Shockwave out of Golden Buddha set it up that kill on Turtle Snowball the game they killed the Nexus game for was just a tight back and forth the fact they defended a baron buff dragon fight and came away with the team by victory for soul that was impressive that was good stuff that I could they also trusted go to glue things like this, does not work if Grayson doesn't pop off on the LeBlanc we're going to Reliance Health again and the global or in the old going to come through from Grace's attitude that you up and it worked out for them to put the pressure on him and he delivered now he is on your he is one of three very important damage horses on the team we get such Ronnie back in now for sfer Spence go to the front line EGF what's the style of round I don't think I can do it and honestly I think there is a lot of pressure on Houdini because even his greatest critics or okay you're a really good game play video games at your day self him getting that in game 5 it is a dream scenario you do for EG but it also put the extra pressure on him like Okay show it down again you just had a great said game be utility for the team lot of good place setting up for his teammates no taunting bathing people in he seems to prefer it be performing well now this deep into the series but they are going to have to rely on that but from Fike Westside in best-of-five like this will you start to get you know the reverse sweep taking place all the momentum early winds from those tons of people tweeting at all you'll fly Quest higher see they're stopping them obviously it's over Chichi that starts to turn around when when you have lost back to games and you're now facing the reverse sweep there's so much pressure so much tension now for the side of flyquest to pull it out as a third seed as the favored team coming into this alrighty well right now to see the line of scrimmage no longer any cheeky one of the ones Shiki level one that again that is are there invades know there are not defensive Ward recall I'm even the jungle was in the same spot in front of the Red Bluff in Camp can I take my box away we're good to go you know sit down and try brush makes you can I get aggravated okay cool back to the start we go spend staring going to be a blue bow start same for santorin looks like there will be some leash thing in both cases here that's where I'm going to be at for a second late but you can laugh Vine over shouldn't actually be very hurtful there you Autos from bang not very much mayonnaise but not very many Autos wants me to pay for the way from the beginning. Want to give away the early early pressure similar here for solo but he's not going to let him any good little time down there alright let's see if he's going to start on hot side he reports in Turin possibly looking I mean you mentioned that the devil stairs and bottom side for ignorant and wildturtle it's a super defensive line that bang and Stacy were able to draft do you know as a real problem is one of the most difficult to try and make plays on so it would have to be them getting super aggressive for some reason and kind of exposing themselves other than that probably should just be to the power clear here at graves so good at Power clearing and should be able to get the the early CS of Andover State Sewanee at which point you get to start going for those in Bates and with face rest rising to prominence and getting so many bus makes it even easier for Graves to to work around such money that's little play earlier on ignore walk in and take a Brahma cuter than ICS so at least that's a bitter goal tonight from bang Auto comes in twos going to land sold grab total should feel comfortable but not completely cancel that one is they knocked down the minions they grab the cannon no big deal here for BCS so far for the Senate as solos getting attacked by Hootie as you tend to with gameplay footage of the manifold pretty aggressively as much as possible so of course just never liked on the door and she'll do the regen but Reidsville enough nice Barrel, but keeps it going who initially Council up in his Lane Cellars week is very fast but obviously we'll be down so yes here who need canvas kit for more Mana as needed or Houston in that was important to get through that side step cuz that would have been a lot of certain damaged if you'd pulled out grow their I mean people often times Focus so much on GPS call generation and the scaling for the champion but trial by fire the passages so good for him to try and trade on a lot of mail a champion super early on and as you're saying you just get your corrupting potion used trucks are all the charges through your biscuits and try and just continue to spend that out with your grasp also making you tank here I should also mention with this matchup because every time we see it we always have people going what the Gangplank adjust orange out of mordekaiser alt yes that is possibility very favorable interaction that's one of the things that were kind of so good at is saying that you're won't be wanting me you're topping is not doing his team fight power right you're not getting back from Osaka not get additional fees off and now meanwhile santorin stop that as well just being alone the fact that it's like so aggressive there in Torrance on the way let's get out no big deal Barrel vision and he's going to be out for this one who he's I get thumbs up really not a problem buddy don't worry about it I like it by the way. But at least link into that brush if you push it into the turret that's an easy pop Christmas Karen to be to say are you there you are not okay good I can fight between normal yeah is that we've seen him make a note concerning Lane positioning checking stuff like last time we saw him know with the kind of bait where he just walks over looking like he's attempting to Ward to try and I set up the game for his teammates and they're reading the movement of his opponent as super aggressive from solo with low health no reason for him to go for a chase down if Grace is not there even without vision how big is just gone shoes play by ignorance and gold yeah it's our likes to roam around a lot and it gets a huge play for car, this was going to be one of the areas to actually attack for EG early Gamecock muff but my goodness ignore coming to set him up even gives over the last hit what a beautiful support play absolutely massive steps walked over the wall with the lantern as you said on point with the play nowhere for goldenglue to go tonight bring him down as well not since Karen does head up to try and play with Tony again we mentioned you know who he likes Edge Ronnie able to stack up a stunt really quickly without level 6 they don't have the extra stuff so they are going to call it off since he obviously here with no more charges in the corrupting potion completely dry of Mana that is important to farm lead and pretty Campo to go for a Sheen or something else could have easily at least a thousand gold so probably boots on top of it and have the ruin to make those free iwatobi picked up for himself as the Ruby Crystal comes through when you going as fast you can't with Triforce if it helps make sure you stay safe to look at Max the recall who needs to walk to Lane so it was an armed guard his Tepee for this one and Global Advantage for him not to mention the gold he's got + $10 equal in farm right here
