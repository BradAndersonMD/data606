are the biggest differences between professional league and Venus playing at home here we go there let's get into the game Champion Select Bragg Blvd. It's already off the table as well all right not willing to first pick it definitely the ergot atrox a collie all things still floating around here so we'll see how they want to whittle them down field you kind of notorious for leaving up a lot of power pics and exchange in trying to get them back because they feel like they can play around them or have worked on strategy specifically tailored to expectations that you know the enemy team is going to make a note we will at least have a tosser got possibilities akali still a possibility and I know Phoenix and solo both have put in a decent work on that champion so they definitely be willing to pick it for a dart Transit very good on sign across the three games so far on the ALCS what am I to sign gamesir in lhr to grab the right away and you try to bully out Josh, that's not blame for the last roughly year at does a little bit weaker than is normal form he's been very good in the past couple captions under his belt but as much as good reason he I will see one of those gymnastic split push back at 12 now for Canon or at the kill shirt yep illusion gone across as an easy pickup use as he will be looking pretty badly really drafty or not to be afraid truck's not much of a surprise before she said not to let me get X across yeah I mean basically for the Marksman it has come down to the top 380 carry his band usually as usual KY star the next Tuesday before the second round of bands come through cuz that's going to push you to the lower-tier with work on getting weekend I feel like the other answer had been teams that had good xayah rakan players but you don't slow down a little bit for the long range and the quickness Synergy broken with double used to be very unreliable Play Nothing More for kiting back here these third tahm kench game of The Flipper file Frosty Returns playing field you one of the few standing this still want to do this to yourself very heavy back like we did just see Ezreal etiquette of hard carry a game in Stinky Pants fix a candle to the same and I kind of like the back and forth herein this damn Slick Rick here on Nocturne provides a lot of snow cross map potential split bushing becomes greatly empowered when you have Nocturne in Keizer with these long-range ultimate abilities where you can join a lan but they fired Back Bay pick themselves up as Rio NV Tom Kenny voice has been used so well by team early on in the game to gain momentum odd no rotating bottling up top or something to get to her place in front of used as throughout the game so both teams now to try and make those snocross map or at least very long-range movement overload trip like I think the first 14 amendments in the game so much right now you can see what kind of Champions these teams are worried about Cena got to go to more of the engage I've been saying if you want to play support for Norflex the atrox around and put the orange stop playing in bringing those Sondra those are not allowed for you and if you can aggressive Camille not an option anymore as well so that might be missing or might be reinforced with its own already more nasty covers the way to do that actually is maybe really nauseous I mean it's our people in the middle and you need AP nasus could all you've done a lot of because most of the games of the team that he's on will revolve around Midland alright well as well certainly not a lot in North America really popular worldwide otherwise so we haven't put a lot of games onto a big loser to bring such a house without a lot of other Mala Champions yet so we'll see if he's going to have to stock up most of his own stunts quick lock box is being expires off the kind of universal pick your with Oriana whenever you're not quite sure what you're going against my word I can still Flex from top or mid lane tier old for it now as we enter nowhere asriel X Gwen Stefani or going so what's the last pic where is there. Going and what's going in about half way to say no to me a truck stop in Oregon did for sure and they will put Power of evil honest than in that midlane up against Dorian it will be darshan fighting solo on the Ergo grip vs. orianna can definitely has killed pressure I would put more jungle attention mid now seeing this even though you're not going to have you do extra help. Help those stunts and tricks find it up herself in a lot of burst damage potential at the level 6 mark okay so time takes down Rock Casino more spots down here I do like it looks like a pretty well-rounded King fight group to give us the Oriana ball on the Nocturne shop of deliveries pretty strong right there Jaco has been great on thrush epoche Isabella Wednesday picked up one of those she was him on that champion getting a lot of really good Hooks and getting a lot of her damaged basketball on towards fix a pinched nerve in front of front lodestone with the doctor and as they're coming in since you're ready quickly the shock wave will still probably get off if there's a combo incorrectly those though I feel like that does add an extra layer what's your device look like as Echo Fox get ready to go both these teams sitting at 2 and 2 as he mentioned the previous Cana when you're put you in a tie for second with that black but lost really there is there's some room underneath Team Liquid but there's a lot of space but he seems to get up there and start making the right forward CLG onto straight wins can certainly move forward here and I think it's mean that their fans can be excited for what time do the rent for this one alright Russ going to lethal Tempo Nocturne looking for some early snowballing we'll see how he gets to level 6 quickly or not spread out looks like pretty defensive normal start here for all it's just going to watch the entrances will keep its total crap Ward's go dad usually around 1 minute 20 to keep track of those which one is probably going to have to defer wait to species the Nocturne in trade you're looking as the boards may or may not go down using the second player to kill a drink at War before it turns invisible sometimes you can double up in a brush or something and get lucky and positioning on those brushes and 4/5 fraction 6/8 you can see already got it it does have the klepto so usually the Ezreal likes to go for these early phase of damage but he did not see if I follow and did not land his cuso nothing gained off of that klepto war and those are some slow attack speed Champions not able to get the last one down said you want me and her got will know that the version is here at the very least that's okay ultimately no harm no foul who sell was actually looking for it here puts down the poro and the ward that will see the crugs beware Wiggly goes next for sure they're going to have information here on Wiggly no matter what can't be goes to neck unless you go straight for Scuttle what you'd be insane Sunday's kill pretty good start and you have those trucks going to be spotted so it will be a known jungle path and I expect to see a thing up there or just simply solo saying there's the pink sand yep that's where the champion. You can only guess that's we're not friends going but it is a very common past this point to go running to Crunch yeah and they do have their also bottom work here you can see since they're pretty sure doctor starting off my bedside and read into frogs up through the river for the bottom Scuttle is pretty common you can go over to the rafters after drugs as well now this signals to me that he wants to get his cancer respond as quickly as possible in a rush to level six his rushing level 6 usually just want to do all of your own noodles to get the second spawns up if you have to do a full second wave of them to get it and not necessarily using the time even to go into the river for scuttles running back and forth pretty seriously here rush I does not go by any Vision to Again by him not looping around the bottom side they have had it surmise he probably did Raptors search either way it's got to be no problem for him now will be spotted but it's too late to do anything about that one as they trade some camps and that's why he has a only partially cleared drugs that looks like there's a hair over there's the biggest thing to write this sausage why don't you can count 11 so yes dear and you can say he is cleared his red side probably not dipped into the top side Scuttle and he should be able to get both shuttles now at his nose that's why he is cleared the full top side there's no reason for her to go back that way and should be able to get up very early level six. Nocturne honestly all right well darshan pushing the top five selling to get some of this BS is be a little bit awkward the dash gets in the reset just enough damage this one is going to be dropped her. Also so darshan here this is why I like to see from the top laners darshan since you've got the early shove there with her got the moves down he blows the plants plants so they are the fires Bloom so that they get the vision on tourist visa how much work he's doing he doesn't have time to take the Scuttle able to deny it from rush but they are keeping tabs on him for sure and write well double Scuttle still feels pretty good for the doctor in here you mentioned how to rush for the 60th power clearing camps still getting all the crabs and I don't feel pretty solid now getting to be too late bluebuff pick up before minute but I'll grab it but that's probably okay they also have the timer on Craig's remember it's 2 minutes and 30 seconds for a respond of a small camp they had vision of it there for Echo Fox nose and he did yellow pink on the crugs I said want he's going to be here now he's yellow painting this trybus word if you do that to your top laner is so cute and they still get ganked and they died that's an order on you at this point so so loud that I should know that he's here that yellow stuff you wash rugs Wiggly getting slow down flash flash for nothing last of the face check again if you wore these out there if you want me to tell you is Flash I mean it's that is definitely is a bit of a filter not working at a little bit earlier so you don't have to lose your flash go see if they're even punished for it though yeah I'm a chocolate doesn't have it he is also be up soon though to contest with the ergot alternate typical Sheen recall for 6 a for the azreal that's what I think you said what you want listening bad happens to your forced back early can a flight for a bit of land pressure is the RICO going to come back for a follow-up was well at first plate to able to get some early money here for Apollo and I'll glow boosting recall time of year because I'm going to the face of a non-padded waves and protecting fairly quick for 6 AM, shut this down they can deny some farm from the caixa it couldn't have PP of course it doesn't matter anymore if you do T P Henson Farm Lost TV show, in bottomland 4 Pro play just for that wave management let's remember this is the area where they burn the flash so that's usually what you want to Target butt again level 6 is coming in me and syndra first potential and this is not a barrier Oriana this the cleanse drink it out of one of the Sun but definitely going to have to be very careful about the pure damage that can come out because we'll be layered ultimate as well as picking up passive can be done now you have to do your passport before the ultimate one if you want to use both those preclude you from using it again so we'll wait to see is the first things have yet to Really Happen topping was just a flash force and that was it you kind of knew it was sort of coming and that was safe enough brushing a third skull oh baby did you guys juice Russia's feeling good farm boy yeah it is best he played the carthus size on the doctor fully-formed up ready too old and he's a minute faster than the average to level six year 4 Pro play Global Lisa Rush feeling pretty good about this one is a sub-7 an ultimate look for the plane I will get any help back from that yeah a lot of lot of pressure being exerted by the bottom line here following hawkwell getting their Turf late first continually pushing in WoW Wing them to get vision of the river once again, I talked about last game the highway of summoner's Rift is the river this allows you for transition plays early on in the game between all of the Wayans that's where you see a lot of the early game advantages game no not only is a dragon but it's also Rome's of support roles of the jungler you know getting off those early flash advantages definitely mean the difference and let's see if they can find their exit on a spill on the top side he's mostly back on that flash the only two minutes left to punish this one otherwise can I get away scot-free in that war doesn't really need much of anything Peewee differential controller top sites can help attract some of those movements for nocturnes so even though he has a lot of level six offensive potential syndra is a very very easy target for something like the paranoia especially when combo 2 with the Shockwave looks like there but not trying to be able to Shield it up Echo Fox put the least ring the cloud and there it goes over the jungle is a feeling pretty
