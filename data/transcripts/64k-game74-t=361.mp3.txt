with treats in the lineup I like the swaddle up yeah yeah I couldn't see how she's can perform over a larger sample size of games and if he did get that TV to kill in his debut yesterday that's obviously feeling really good if they can pick up another win Eire know they are kind of keeping Pace a little bit more with of the top of the standings as and liquid you know we'll be within Striking Distance if it can grab a win here today but likewise on the other side has been struggling to be honest I haven't been able to string together or really any consistency throughout those are kind of leader half of their games here it's kind of surprising for because I feel like we talked about flyquest it was always their consistency that was praised most liked that was what we look at as as the team's greatest strength is not they were able to know play these kind of slower Styles games that they were so good at to finding the power of evil with so reliable and as a resultI love or maybe not in peak level of some of the other teams that are absolute best but they are always a really really solid Squat and they feel like they have lost some of that consistency perhaps trying to adjust their place I was in the current meta trying to play more aggressively and at times failing in doing so you know allowing themselves to throw away leaves at 4 what games do the course we have the lineup back up here is Blacklist has put wild turtle back in there were one of them if they were four and four with mashed turtle is back here at Ashton Place and Academy we back on this one here and grab Center for themselves as they have seen as the 421w showed up at Citra came earlier is it split so I wouldn't be surprised anymore to see Devils play something turn on Mark's been down there but I also wouldn't be surprised to see in place andfrom split to yell it was rough always work out for them there but to be honest here this is a champion that he will play a lot by now I do think that it was something that you can add to it before he always hasn't had the most except outside of marksman but he has been able to pick up like every men immarksman ever throughout his career right you know maybe Draven or something like that not the dream has always been more friends anyway and it kind of one of those teenage pics of that he will be able to pick it up and see what kind of animal are there going to bring hear play Wukong skin Academy so it could be that stand of Wukong volume that they're looking towards I could be something with him for me or even things like send it TK have obviously worked a fair bit in the past week and play kind of more of those standards towels there too but I always want to see if you're going to have a farming Santa some I formed of DPS elsewhere and I do think that this is already shaping up to be a draft that I can get behind Oriana yes people always think about the birdplay Rihanna's High DPS especially later in the game Olaf obviously a champion that can build full damage and really add a lot of specially in those early midi instrument is this is something that you can be supported with this an ultimate Euro La flying in Saint Al's comes across allow you the extra tank unit and the added damage a coming through in a flex deduct more you know who it does feel like a pretty well crafted for 3 on the other side quest draft I think looking quite good also volunteer respect you to go junggle a very steady pick here to Ken's graph with Olaf front damage rating is pretty good there is a strong leader and Ash in a power from the center here in the tundra and of course I Do I Do by the way I want to give Credit Unit I like the idea of early Senate and then waitwith a farmer has a lot of good luck the other half of that polish have like 19 possibilities all the TSM side we met and fresh going to get rid of some support for the ash down there, as well, again there was a lot that can be played the TSM I took him to save toppling for last I think they round outfought laying here and then give broken play the counter picked as you were mentioning that they have DPS in another roll to the support of senna you know about the retainer Top Lane I do think that they were lacking a little bit in the engage right now it was kind of just Olaf run at you and that's your engage so I think is fine allowedto round out their bottom line based on the picture from flyquest what are the problems that sometimes happens when you do go to the Senna plus military South lot Lanes is that your opponent's can then pick a specific to match up that is really heavily favored we already had ashes a dominant later and then you pick something like a rain support that is really advantageous gets whatever to get them would go for you can really get in a hole in that bottom line We Are Kari can't farm at all. So they want to play this I think a little bit more than I do think it could be looked at as a picoway to that is something that obviously cordage a double if you play a lot of a Pantheon Sapori here I do believe yeah it's possible that they're going to put some crazy but it should be Pantheon the Portwood teen pop out a little bit more people going press the attack obviously you camp rock that 3 hit combo very quickly for the bonus damage increases the damage of Ashton a lot of Cece and set up across the board here I do think the internet options to go through all three lanes Renekton with the sun pant down with a stunKendra Scott of the week like you can pretty much go anywhere so it is 3 bra more the defense of option if Pantheon books to engage on your Santa the brahmas there to try to block the follow-up from the Sandra from the ash as far as that is coming through I'm going to go with that more defensive Auctioneer okay well very large out there by that you can absolutely rely on a speaker has been hit-and-miss please had some very good games but if we do see warrior build I expect it really take over on the West Side the wild turtle is back in the ignore ignore has been a very strong performer this year he's got the pantheon support that's going to be fun cuz a lot of really good engage out of here right Pantheon Global Center for across the map if you Lance has done the arrow is guaranteed by the way if you really need to but this is going to be very excited to watch for the reduction of course grab for solo at the top is going to report this game till I got to see that Warren was I think 95% of the actual top are there said okayreactants give me counterpick brutalize this guy full of jungle was the pretty pic of this drafts of flyquest I think our boys has a lot of really really strong aggressive plays and every lane and I would say that in the style of games where the Joker has a lot of options become so important for TSM because oftentimes you know you have some Lanes where it's like okay yeah sure you could go there but you're not really expecting it you know people that don't have any cactuses with your playing with an Ezreal laying or whatever all the times you know your kind of going to be sitting back and not a second the jungle play there allows one of your lanes play with little bit more freedom in this case you don't really have that luxury on TSM you have got to be scared of the Jungle showing up in any single rain gear so it does mean now that you have done was going to do a really really good job of actually tracking santorin throughout the entire game making sure that they're well aware of where he could be us so that the Lanes on the other side the map to play more aggressively in and not just seat control across the boardanswer the question can be a course that could be kind of brush I believe in you know we could have been there but there is a war that is over that wall is bought from LFO is is probably about as strong as you possibly get the speaker's you still cannot immediately there is a fight return to the ALCS in the 400s from TSM but because they knew they got spotted they swept out toward you're allowing your opponents to have to prepare for that if you checked into santorin wild turtle and ignore her we're already on the Red Bluff View windows but because there's actually them getting spotted they know they're spotted and then as you're going to double if you're actually getting the words because moving forward and just absolutely gets burst down to Turin very intelligently started Q there for the stunt to be able to walk him up for his teammates in in TSM just was not work on that and date I think that once you're spotted you either have to continue to move forward as a SWOT is a brush or you just have to say oh that sucks it didn't work time to go back to my blue buff and they have since you didn't either we could speak it kept going for resting kept backing off Jacob over first blood and Flash yeah read as the other three of TSM we're literally attacking awarded that is rough stuff word for a ward as DSM go so you know it's the flight for a horse so early Lane pressure here doesn't surprise me at all if there's no way Santa really deserves Lane pressure when she's the 80 carry that I was just too busy knocking down mittens with takes awhile for you so okay there's a girl before they can go fight for the first Deport I love this push to waive support runs and Wards heater blew up or drop isn't very first and we had to push my bottom late is XSport even deeper there you can see how things are going very very far for his Ward actually spots at way farther back near the Grumps start near near where the woke movement is because they want a blue bugs that Olaf had to do this is worse than The King and I don't even completely blame him like half the first step was the recipe of his fault happen is on him for going when they're heading towards that one is just like okay they did call bought missing but are you really not allowed to go for your own blue stuff write it and that's that's a situation you have to evaluate because I think that speaker was expecting but that was just in his day for a car to to word it out in her ass right you know if you see someone missing but you're not that concerned us to be a full commitment but that does she have three buff into Des on speaker this earlier and I talked about how when you're playing these Santa, there is a lot of important enough to damage as the Santa alone to really make it work right like you're not going to punch through the Volver in the Renekton quickly by yourself you need Olaf you need the Oriana to be having good games versus down 10 see us getting zoned out like it at your juggler is just screwed he's basically half Farm you got three boxes died twice in four minutes if the cat is really concerning not just for the visual before the overall team composition how it's going to function here. Lolita course we're still here as well so that is a wave yet to be fine but still feel like a leaf doublelift out about Elizabeth damage but very easily play around this Pantheon feeling good that you're going to prom and broken blood is actually a game if it's a scrim u u u f f the game and you go next like this is a 2000 gold eat at 5 minutes with a composition that is is focused more on on early and they came out with say on TSM side I don't believe that they have enough tools to to make a left at like 1 benign carry so I don't think you know you can you can make this look like the kind of UV style games or watch it takes over later there are obviously lots of opportunities over to get them to come back but they are at incredible disadvantage early on and I'm one of the few kind of Saving Grace is here as is bleeding so it's pretty well down in the bottom side and that they will be able to grab this dragons those are cool things working for them but very concerning start for TSM okay do you send you got to work back and almost 2,000 gold deficit with a mountain drink to your name and in front of Drake spawn in about 5 minutes we'll see if it's possible as you mentioned yes there is a Libra TT the bottom like some of that it's the fact that turns to a couple of recalls off of the kiltie got an event to get to complete some Farm but it is done with a small farm lead I was kind of gold leaf first let us go to make sure that's not really the case but stop when fighting back and forth. I believe got a me when does he was still in the middle of Bella's breakfast all of his six first Broken Blade comfortable enough to keep battling back of the wave get Broken Blade wants to try to push this out I Look to reset this speaker is up there and he's sick now so if someone gets too aggressive there is no opportunity to maybe get something done but it does seem like there's some some kind of pains around that area so they're not really confident to do it even if a backbend coming through from PS are you a good step in the Bog Bulger could be up there and is as can be spotted now though so we'll see if there is any sort of the class or just give me a little tonight for apps Ben is getting jumped back and forth by POA Centric Lasley considered a strong counter to the Oriana overall so yeah he's going to kill this matchup going to retain at least 10 CS difference if you're sincere about the wave and we'll see as Pardeeville just every single time by the way we're at the wave go make a top with a pretend you might be invaded make the ball in afraid that you might come down the river is it okay to pipeworks go to That's Amore. Very slowly and it's always very very good on that for a while so pretty nice attack speed there. There's no TP on on anyone except Broken Blade so there's no way I can respond to this so it is probably already did Rose Kennedy coming in will see how they start this up a lot of the Waves as they turn off the turret there was no possible way you survive it was effortless and the gold comes over so I can assist for power bi I want to know if your son is out of math Easy Auto command couple of slows they're really good chunk Pearson 4th to go to pay for me we used to be but I got you killed it again Crystal now but it'll do if you're just so squishy at that point where did you just one more time your accent is out of man that they know he didn't have flash so
