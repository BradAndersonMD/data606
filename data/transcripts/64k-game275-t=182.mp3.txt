how many strong performers on the or overall 204 spots themselves the LPS what is maybe they can finals last spring and went to world with the squad but now we do have ourselves a lot of the bands have been very similar it was previously the irelia Cassiopeia and Jace is now in the Midland maybe there's a little bit of that they are going to be as far as any of the level six killed pressure that you can bring with the Champions were complaining Pierce and also both music irelia is the all-around go to make specially for Mid laners thattrying to set up their teammates and set up a lot of room tours that make it in okay weather might run down to the bottom line is Iraq on locked in the very early and extremely fast water grabbed it right away by our kind of hurt a great bottom line over the other lane bullies most likely down there so no responder and ricegum middle or top especially when you can get the combination in the round do pick order here was Diane work on being picked up with confidence level one outputs much more fresher with that combination we've seen people get early level kills on all sorts of Champions solution Flash from even accepted there so and then again band that very well could be on the bottom side we saw it last weekend if we'll have to Calista that's why I was banned here then going with you early game domination and I absolutely smashed thatearly game and still trying to do so on this if we wait to see what the Final Fantasy V Collective sigh driven away from broken play hoping that counter doesn't come through basement or match of who he wants to play yes still Banning a lot of Top Lane Champions even though the rise could be flexed up to the topside the galio very likely is support although the flexibility is still here just last night in Korea a long time recent. I'm going to lose my job position is designed around work on a lease Orlando address and you kill them instantly I don't have a chance to take the body away from Cloud 9 a lot for either team removed rooting versus broken blades akali mid laner in mid I am extremely excited for our going to have I walked in Legos for much much more powerful Lane dominant style and a collie will have a hard time dealing with that sort play the bank easily play up to the top side to get birth control and with a jungler like at least I expect his Clutch Gaming composition to take fire Leon 2016 week 9 real serious or clutches run will be cut short and they will not see the postseason piglet how do I fight you in a one-on-one another three on one when you dive MyLink might look better that we got to stop an employee's check in with you say thanks. I got a chance to catch up with Sebastian Park Park of Clutch Gaming to ask him a little bit about these last-minute roster changes that we've seen and he told me very bluntly listen or 5 and 11 right now we have low chances of making playoffs we need to make a change and that change is bringing back Midland and Cody son so that Cody sun is been performing an academy so they wanted to give him a chance at LCS today and bring a piglet to the mid lane is going to unlock amazing potential and Synergy all in the top side with both Mira and I'm excited to see it back to you guys yeah I not only have they made some roster moves here but even more exciting some Champions moves everybody's very very hyped up on who neon Lane dominant Champions bully champions in vain right now not only is she a strong of 1D One later up or something like the akali here but scales incredibly well into the mid game all you need your blade of the ruined King you're a razor blade and you can absolutely take over but do it when you can do here you can see already establishing that control as we talked about on the top side you can hover in the brush get the Autos off this greatly boosted by the fact that you got a couple of those Callaway's autosoft waiting for broken play to walk back to you right now he just got his first & Main Event of experience of the entire many ways and the biggest thing here you touched on your loving skarner and professing your new home is not going to do anything to rectify the situation is carnivorous at least the early game is at least his kingdom here so it should be about Lyra keeping Looney in this situation all you really even have to do like people just sit there yet awardee Fitness Garners topside jungle and there should be no influence here a bank and Tumble away from skyner Dodge out that he can also condemn this Garner backwards and the only thing scar has a surprise factor is Flash and I was going to be the thing to look around then if it does come through or the front light can think up and think back to hoody's Infamous Lucian top Dan against TSM an amalekite outscale them I'm not sure Galia was trying to reduce like the same here in this one but yeah Frontline so 5 and 5/8 fairly equal is probably tough for them will wait to see if that comes through is the middle and two fighting off the fence that is really true and I feel like luck gaming are going to very easily quickly pay their taxes are the Quicksilver Dodge is going to be necessary if they can get those on their carries than Acadian becomes much less useful yes you can point out the way we got honey actually going to have somewhat fun to get one here and you can see of course I can try to make sure that probably does not get do if your body at least but with ensuring xpf even more serious is going to miss for this so still going to rain behind Winnie and then do to change the situation you come over and hug the Tower with them and they can hold hands under there while they watch CSI at the truth but other than that it is just a rough life for a call here in this Lane and who needs should be able to continue his ways now the main player I'm looking at though even though that's a cool match-up is Lira there is only at least for the game juggler Ramsay quits to dye your repel you can drop tower Agro she has execute damage so it's going to be a lot about beer also proving himself why do they keep him on this line of rebuilding this team Around lyrics this is a game that they have to win they want their playoff spot I think he's a player that has to perform and I will see his first Bloods and pretty good the early in fact I've been okay for collective in the mid-to-late game that have fallen off and I did mention drink Champs like Cody's been known as a late-game hard for him and Carrie and as long as he gets his right resources and they get to the team fights with a gold lead to handle the tanks maybe looks good at aiding running around to the Jungle looking for and against the might be office for minutes to take the camp tender respond but so far not finding any gold income for himself just an aggressive towards that we are will not spotted to go through his own jungle taken away some of the Raptor Camp right now what does collapse and help we're a bit as he chases them off so Katie is going to have to get back to his own side right now leaving. Spotify control Southern jungle to follow the red box that's what a katydid at this time thank U observers that has yet to see something that is so far they're not tracking litter but she goes to Crossville then know that what side he's on me because the chance of Brooke medicated to do something what is the weight for 6 before that becomes anything good right now 44 to 20 in CS is that toppling Mark mid and bought though a bit closer to equal and we'll see how many of these broken plates you grab and he tried to get now have to see if he has them will believe any of the rest I would also say it's very beneficial for Clutch Gaming the first dragon here is an infernal Drake Dragon some extra pressure towards the bottom side as a metronome starter once again went topside they're just following up on the crowds right now and pick was going for the invite but we had a ward though his first one just miss that we passed it earlier so they actually know he's waiting for this looking for what invade might be probably knows he's safe and sound is not coming up so he's able farm and then it goes back to Lane all right checking back in on the bottom Lane keeping amount of Cs leave here for it's been and smoothie. So far doing quite well for themselves galio I really love the support taken a lot of okay yorkson 6 does not have TP about the flash we need zip getting away no harm no foul and I like just looking at the positioning there you know if you're very very good knows that he does not have Vision on that top side with a controller that cluster able to put down to keep playing defensively doesn't extend himself knows that delete is on the warpath fairly odd looking for games on the Beast always when you feel the way I am going to try to go to the topside still going through a war this timely response with the sweeper then go to the pieces on the word comes down and still around topside that's not the first hole for out for Broken Blade has he is hextech revolver and the ultimate access is here so this is the window pretty soon especially if he is in his six that they can make it home from that vein game that Fain Lane around yeah I mean you can be down and still hit Level 6 on a collie and go for a kill right eye definitely a lot of burst damage in the kit once you get access to your are button Katie and does have a control board on to this infernal Drake but not too far away actually look up tethered it doesn't matter because there's a good GSM control work in the back of the pit as you should you write under the scarn right there so they know that there is Vision just worried about can he do anything about it both men are mid laners have recalls so you don't want to come too risky on oh playmate for that occasion life-size XP was 5.1 got a long way to go to the ultimate avail bottling brush ganc Boca Toca que oh nice Ward what's a down they knew something might have been a mystery Ali smartfly you saw so he's been very far away in case I'm going to have to jump was able to do so no need to get away from my brother all right this is kind of the one point of power and offensive Lane for TSM Right Now lyrics trying to turn it around just out of fog of War you say bait in a move from TSM it. He might be the one to do it I think I don't know if skarner could be here as well the only thing smoothie ever that works been turned up every time so gen 3 V 3 may be a bit of a possible Punisher they just can't put as far as even though they're actually outnumber the opposition we know akali can't keep these what do you burn his recent as well as sugar first item to not get all in assistance paying put down there by TSM members I think they're calling for a room down here maybe from Acadian after work. Going to be able to get level 6 off this 50 standing office mid with blue selection of a canyon has to be bossed side so now they know and I can still try and the patience pays off for Clutch Gaming assistance pain goes unheeded there and it is going to be a kill over but the akkadian take this moment to clear out the controller will he go for the dragon afterwards knowing they were recalls bottom starter cancel this dragon by the way very very strong on the Spire right here give you plenty of attack speed looks like it's going to do so so that is not without a cough syrup and infertile Drake for CSM their kind of happy to get that on the back half of the first Blood going over with how many games has the could be a very big deal for them going through the middle Lake game as the Drake goes down to text Darcy goes to Acadian and that Dragon earned by smoothie and sven's play here in the to V3 even though they do give up The Kill by they do a lot of damage initiation there from Vulcan get the full combo on this bench and they turn their side towards for the year to the Gallo can't back out even though he starts ultimate with the extra Shields nobody from CG does go down toppling remains a farm off for now looks like it's getting tightened up a little bit Broken Blade not going to get much CS as before with extra ability power to last hit minions and level 9 will be a bunch of damage on that to you when it comes through and look at a lot of them with that
