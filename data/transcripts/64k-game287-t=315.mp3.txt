you can learn as well what we're pushing our way back into Champion Sykes over and throw things back over the freaking cold will it get in the game confirm freak has it in his hands now that me and it's Kobe clean hand off as well we did yes to a size 0 and four start but what if I'm coming around when I forgive you this once there one around Arrow back in the country and you figure maybe they're not as packed they would be interested turn things around us hope for Golden Guardians here off the gospel a pleasant start with an Academy have your roster at 2 and 2 they can approve the three here I mean there's a couple ways of looking at it right they call you know what if you're making these switches and then they lose everyone's going to blame them right for changing something that works but you can also look at I like oh they have practice with the team also and they decided it was better than their team that started to and too but it would be a very fearsome team that also other teams wouldn't have much info on 42 day break if it is going to be golden Guardians first win or if it will be optic number two's first win each other so well cover like what you're ignoring Mountain band away from Destiny still not letting them play this Champion I feel like you to wait a bit or stylist here but maybe a blind that I don't know almost always Top Lane do I have to have in the Box before he can be played in the Midland Texas leaking also be plated support however frog and doesn't seem like the Midland type of player player player either way is grab that was not much of a surprise with Raven off the table here so definitely go into the Fearless in this one I don't know I feel like an arrow to play something else but yeah that's it seems like it's possible option for exam according to play really aggressive there's a thrashin therefore be back on the stage. Was subbed out because gate had played more with Austin and we had always heard good things about being a pro all of it all of the people on Optik players as well as management so we'll see if this does change anything for how they operate in game because I got it right here cuz I'm fixing to get locked in there on bands I can't quite tell either way yep that was a very fast what are you afraid of here both teams most likely or gotten by on our top-line go to go to get first dibs on picking their wedding way junglee set of pinched down medium right now about the type of jugular that you want for pro play write a lot of people in the camp of Gleason and kozik the things like that especially in lck so much early game you still buy your lane you mind some to replace you get early dragons and you Snowball the heck out of the game however all our games in North America has been going much slower on average $10 games and when you start to take that into account then you have to think about wealthy jungle experience for can't later in the game has been taken down but some people are often to go with those things like the Newnan that we saw all ready to take Lonnie are they going to operate very effectively as tanks without much levels or evens things like the I burn that were hovered not pick today that is definitely something that can be thrown around if you're expecting the game to go you no longer however I still think that the best way to play right now is the picture Leaf in or out your Camille play Fast get your days off for your laners get here to cleaners Bridge off of her it's okay well go in here and make sure they know what Crown is playing Nocturne is the hover it's been grabbed freaking yato ban against frog into I would like to speak to scrims where that topped off because that is that is something that I would definitely like introduced back into Pro play but we're we're on the docket ultimate as well as doctor can jump on somebody though videos of the same opinion I believe I believe he is okay so cause last time I remember seeing a lot of video problems with back when you went text Brinker are evolving to give Bruiser and he has to be excited around and engaged companies dumping to lead through and give the space for the Cossacks and must think of some way to kite back but no listen to make a lot more sense crown back on list in the midline and out at meet the cars go through ecobee4 frog in Premier Farm play are perfect Champion doubt he would say yes but various was wrong back on the card is going to farm as much as I possibly can and I wonder how much it's going to get canker sore causes pain definitely put damage on that champion can pick them off but I mean if it works out well do you got three Global's on the golden Guardians roster Connors goes in front of definitely join someone's. And let's get some history for people have in frog and followed frog in for his entire career which by the way I use proponent of Carthage Steven NC matchups like LeBlanc back in the days when Roblox was before the reworks and she was extremely opiate assassin he was of the opinion that you can when is West Carthage with well-placed Skittles tea Casillas from very far away you can take desk but still get farm and still be extremely relevant for the team fights for later in the game and I'm very curious track this of course is going to take dark Harvest a Nocturne is one thing but a Nocturne backed up by this giant beam of light coming from the top of your screen to execute you after he don't deals no 75% of whatever of your life means that you don't have much time to react well through the reaction in the game of the day you just hoping to get themselves to win off the shoulder and Tenon roster for the first time in the LCS 2019 season end for a word on Optics new lineup we got to where was that routine thanks guys. We finally get to see the intended optic roster what can we expect from the team there is a lot of talent and well-tended wrestlers with the daughter roster but it's just I would say just another game. Just a lot of time to go to cross the bone so I expect expect us to be very strong The Winning Edge today thank you and best of luck to you back to you guys concise answer well I said it a chance like this song and record it should be able to brutalize a squishy Champion like karthus and he's not running classes over the flash for the way out brutalizer was taken out of the game freak's rated but thank you for the reminder I knew you would appreciate that of course videos back in the LCS as you can see that was his last game already and I know that is one thing to use tasty most people invading his jungle leaving Wars behind GPS won't find anyone and I'll just get the clean seal I believe gardenswartz spotted coming in although you're not really quickly when these guys were coming from my Red Bluff and then big I'm sure they were up to you know nothing nefarious very nice Israel Brom strolling through media has figured it out it is going to be split all right if he's going to go for the shuttle here he was seen over the goat for I believe for media out soon and he didn't he didn't he didn't go into the amazing for kha'zix see if you can actually get it cuz isolation damage do big you will not get level 3 long way around I think it's in large part due to frog and pushing mid-length never I'm thinking about those jungle one do you want yes it is nice to have the bush Advantage for kha'zix if you get pure isolated damage on the Nocturne however biggest difference is 10 mile an hour has come to me first be down because that's going to really ruin your day in Frogmore pushing I really do wonder if I was fired was because you can look at the crab and know that your got burned at the odds armors on the 10 he's never gotten my cool down did I just get pissed when the enemy there comes out I'll let you know I am pissed that he came but I should have it really is your fault if you take that good to know junglas all right well contracts level 3 here with the camp being cleared away is do you wash his hands are going to try to lick his wounds for now you don't expect to win the match up is fine versus Oregon you're going to do what you can to farm and hope you can figure once every seven minutes here because Papa describes was going to blow for blow it's very very close wow overestimated what he could do he got the sprocket is grass-fed one every 7 minutes was it worth it to take it wasn't 300 damage Health back for that stay forever though so long as he doesn't die or pug be punished for his flash know he's warming up these me I never have his very well at is there right now it's got all the one that has to do with his name is worth less than the visually really minor point doesn't matter too much at the Midland if you care about and it's + 6 right now as I can and goes down frog insofar feeling good and the first clear for meetings with mostly tract and so no first gate come through yeah I mean actually mirrored right now contracts on top side fuse on a ward though you're saying he's definitely getting tracked he knows is being tracked Galaxy brain Galaxy expansion worth fighting over or sneaking so big you a good job here early clearing this Ward go to guy's head place that's because there's a huge Advantage for blue side in early dragon and of course that is obviously the blast called now if you're playing a champion that can solo it there are plenty of them in the game right now Glasgow and it's making the first dragon is actually an insane win races so good were there for Golden Guardians that are clear from big and it definitely is a possibility that they have to worry about it specially if your mid and bottom-line are pushing night watch out then for this one is of course that blast Point has a corresponding behind that comes up so but it does make it safer because I don't have earned your teeth yellow it however if you get caught at an ocean Drake ocean Drake slow as you all right well still the safe way to clear plus so far 8 in the midline for frog and feeling pretty good is the crowd Dodie burned is TP to get back to lay a while ago frog is doing his first one here has a catalyst and the way it is he's going to still wait around yes I'm going to go he's close to Catalyst tear actually a little bit after this way will be enough I think it's 1852 the whole thing and not quite as much money as he has right now but he's going to get a good spot if you want to go to the fully stackin bills what is the Catalyst and we'll see what comes up you can afford to you if you want to go for that one darksteel instead and he's going to be just okay to go to go lead over all four golden Guardians and a reasonable early game but not down that much overall it's been really getting away from them in the in the mid-to-late game instead so having the pressure in the bottom lane Ocean break going to go over and it's going to be huge for the early laning phase of optic gaming yeah and it's a caixa that has the language it's okay I know I've seen rank one classic Volvo Gas Works player 2013 shot to Novak game anyways though we are talking about the pushing bottom line as we mentioned before it's even better when it's like I said because of the passive immunity burn through Z Hurley Drake's no big scare here for crown and easily get the clout does have very potent All In Crowd Control shelter and stuff like that it's not interested so yep crab goes over make it pretty close to this level six and there it is for the course you for contracts but we had faster ones from rush hour earlier in the day is to keep playing the minions media to call the auto that one minions with Q does more damage
