how do you super aggressive players who winning in Damonte do they will challenge you mechanically challenged your decision making and some of the bottom teams have not been able to really answer that have not been able to be able to be as a result they often lose a pan can so it's going to be exciting want to look for fans at either team both squads are in control of their own Destinies Clutch Gaming very likely appointments back-to-back to the god of Thieves in the gut Golden Gardens in the worst-case scenario or at least in a tiebreaker in very good spots winnable in both cases it's going to be a very tight by tear the club gaming fans dropped out that one of the others really you mean how did you start dropping off of course you ban Rumble that could happen every single time but the paper that wrist gone as well and beans instant is a lot for Cody Sun potentially their band out again soon as well and I do think of the top like it's going to be so critical you need talked abouthow we saw in a strong performance from estate guys last week you know that was big deal to step up against the attempt and I think he's going to have to have another really strong performance because he is going to ask you if he's the guy who is going to make risky play who's going to go aggressively at you don't really no matter what he is playing and thank God has to be equal to the challenge I was going to make sure we can settle for that one they work on taking away is he Darvin grouser Leon S another aggressive champ comes through for a clutch and when you are you Siri or you can just actually gay straight on to the reconnaissance Blake actually follow work on the when he's trying to dip out or go in for that engaged and you straight up just lock him down and burst him out so really powerful and Gage here already coming out for Vulcan I'm going to excited to see how he will execute on this because you are already going for big is a risky draft yearcan you play a fly lives are on the line but that is how clutch plays in and you love to see them kind of sticking to their guns definitely I think a good choice right here also want to point out there is a positive interaction between caixa and Leona for the Leona Davis Junction on the W now is good against those missiles that hit so many overtimes in each one removed a little bit from the W so that's going to be a little bit of extra tanks. Therefore Vulcan of course Target remind me to squish your back liners with the rest of Team engaging but you know in case that happens to be changed you the address so you know big first pick be right out here by Vulcan a he was always so good on those Indy Sports when they were more meta a very good alisar player I remember you know especially back in Spring is instead of playing that quite a bit or earlier this flipper half but you know I'm so excited to see how this is actually going to work out no, I certainly some of that you do have the temple to dive onto and actually burst out and you have to rememberall the Leona CCU buys time for Cody sent to their feathers over worth you know over top of that Target and then pull back through for additional fees Steve vandeweghe was jamming to keep you really where she is on the Hootie and the Top Lane although both be into my pee have played at 1 so that to remain flexible and you think Jungle Band tonight at the use of course they have that Jarvan and now waiting to see what band want to lock in for the squad of horse Corky or the most common Champions this patch is going to be the likely lock interview get the jury complement Leonard played by Far East 7th Corky play next most played is two games on Victor so you know pretty much anytime you leave it up you have to know that for you is going to take it it is a matchup that use very comfortable playing into against easier and it certainly a lot of fruit do feel that it's Porky favor I so if we were to see that kind of standard matchup midlane Arie would be feeling very good about it well class going to go down the well is that okayyou're supposed to love you never know that seems like the most clutch thing to do right here is there a blast at the ospital and then see what I'm at the top when afterwards but they got rid of the competition hunted these will let fit got to get a kind of figure out some of his most prized fix haven't taken away and let you structurally A big one for fake God has been banned out but waiting on this last pick it will be probably to this back almost more like MSI metal with the flex pick solo laners you know we'll see if this is going to be a collie top or a colleague mid lane when he had a Great Khali game last week no absolutely popped off that was really really impressive in that performance so I will see what they got the answer is going to be because he has to really be comfortable playing into either one of these pics in knowing that lira is going to be playing this gragas differently has some very strong potential but obviously is a great answer honestly to both are there so many dashes between the irelia and the akali drag his body same can be rejectedI do believe you feeling rejected then displayed all of these things connect to be shut down by fake page of Douglass book a little bit here and grabbing the poppy by poppy a lot of course keep mine if you blocked any of a Colles kit you're grounded for 2 seconds so nothing else can be cast as she tries to run around or fails to do is going to be exciting when he resigned the thieves have locked in their life and I really do like to look here I think they are looking solid but again Clutch Gaming 7 in 1 vs. the bottom five teams not been included odds are they're going to look good here they've always been very consistent at being the playoff bar and they might just do it again here as they can no longer push camping ground Hootie is the akali Demonte is the irelia to see how much is Lyoto could you alongside Zion the bottom line has a better chance Papa John's Pizza near Elliot does a really really a does going to struggle into that match up especially in the One Thing 1 and Thing that's always going to be nice if you actually feel them are if it does come to itbike damage is going to be the side which will be physical damage that perhaps God will not be as prepared for all right well time ticking down it's time to do who can make this one happen in a playoff spot on the line two games left to play for only half a game behind the fly off bubble half a game behind thick Owens put you in position both these teams have control of their playoff Destiny's we'll see how it takes shape as he leaves at least we got the lifeI burn to be on the map right now yeah yeah right now it's a dance party Apple trigger words come down at these actually are spotted in this Montague's do press all the emotes in real going to be playing klepto once again has really been enjoying that in a lot of these car keys are going left owing adamante does actually end up letting him get one little Auto off there and I really have his word I do want to hear something from you Artemis going into this game we've had a lot of one one week finishes for CG so what's going to be different this week to make the 200 that you so desperately need one of her preparation the same way you want to change too much but our CEO Michael came in and get a really nice pregame pep talk so hoping that was helpful but we really didn't play our game I think we're super confident both these match up both of these teams we match of great again so as long as we play our game will be fine. When that at any energy for you to be honest we hadn't really been paying much attention to what's going on we know that if he went to the games that we're in for sure so we're focus on ourselves and everything else interesting interesting well let's hear some more noise from are casters thanks very much loud noises here hello audience than hello fellow gamers are some noise I love it thank you so much you are I am also gave her ass SS I've seen it for gamers in Hunter these Gamers here and we're going to move on cuz that was terrible. That was very fine back to meet lady here is that we will be having fun in the early games email a message with the car key can be pretty annoying Courtney has pretty good push with phosphorus bomb especially in a really helping take on a w in and then you while you're doing what you can threaten all in Cork used to be definitely in his comfort zone part of the gameplay pattern just yet that comes in a little bit later but still putting some blows and that is who in the only option one CF the first week and we'll see how much I can get but it won't be 18 fake God certainly will be at the receiving end of this Lane for her for some time but no that's fine because he's going to have a lot of a lot of utility in team but you know what that W3 very very effective and not able to connect with this done there so he's taking definitely the worst into the trade and try to set up a potential fries to force out a Teleport here and he will be able to get as long as you have those words Arrangement is outside of range of the turret you are going to have a pretty effective freeze going on in the Mid-Atlantic Demonte will have to try to stay around it and shove this in that's what's going to happen right there in that knows he's safe I don't believe they spotted Jarvan in a while but you can see he's just sitting there brush make sure that probably give you a comfortable and Powers a w look Seattle tax but knows he needs to be afraid of what he might be doing that we could be over that wall and Sample that would be a lot of damage getting bit in not just on those two no game and now he's made his cut down to only two but it will not freeze in a pretty good spot to see if he has to actually spend at L4 he's just making the run for now and going to have a little bit of the formed and slightly when he does go back to base but things are going pretty well overall even across-the-board Simoni only really notable difference is up in that Top Lane Tennessee sa-4 hunie my stuff right there such gaming feel like she's down and gold overalls with squad for youth poetry isn't raining pretty heavily and doing a good job with that one. Of gold earned 120 from that course he's not too bad you can see the match of difference right there as soon as the entire difference in this game although it has a way of making me a liar yet again amazing go towards coming down here trying to track whatever earlier might do and you can't even see there's there's a lot of emphasis on all this Vision on the bottom side because of the dragon that is actually responding right Aldi's worth in this area to set up for the ocean Dragon which is just about to spawn that is really the highest priority Dragon these days in the early game a hundred want to try to and it will see if they can actually get laying control I could try to look for it you know maybe even if you wait a couple minutes or it's even if I do believe that at the first package for 40 and that is always a great time to try to make that initial play two words neutral object has because package really does give you so much additional power and it seems like to go on packaged so we'll see if that ends up being the power supply kind of fees need we just saw Lira try to sneak in the Box lamp it recorded so nothing happened for hims waves are for your back and forth + 6 PS4 bank so far comfortable Sophie's Valley North Bend scale quite well and we have to track how Leona is actually going to be doing right you know this is combat that work on counter picks really why was grabbed up and we'll see if they're going to be able to ever actually finding gauges to try to make good on that or if it will just end up being more of a passive playing where the turn of events to be forced to try to match power in the teeth by see cuz we know where Khan is so consistent to find those engages and I do think the owner will have a more difficult time getting onto the carries for Half Denver Conley too hard trying to free the 20 minutes waiting in the wings yeah I think he thought they got back to base for sure but just hang around long enough and a pro taking the wave and the Leona what you could send up it's a free route for Cody Sun so half remove giving over an easy First Blood there misjudged the situation wow okay that's good money for free calling app for was just assuming that the Marksman is already gone if it's already gone you can do this but he takes his board stun into roof by the time for the Kodi sunroof those perfectly done there from Vulcan backing up kind of alluding to the fact that Cody sun gone I'm scared in a backing up for the reflex game cuz like you know when that was pushed in Cody has just finished complete yet baby is out of range and if it comes in all the CW I'll get back my throat is fine but the help her with her vocals like well juice on instant in to eat for the route and desire for the route and then he was CC locked until after as you mention misjudged the situation. I can tell you about wasn't able to print a grave mistake right there means a lot to me to come in through volcanic in the 400 so it's less would be as big of a deal but getting a early movie boots always can be nice that certainly does increase the roaming pendulum pendulum gauges that you can pull off you know coming out of fog up being able to get him rage and for that Dennis played in potentially for that ultimate know what he does hit six here so we'll see you can collect UT to make things happen on that bottom side to be feeling really good about that first initial kill but a minute Mark for Corky is coming up here would not be surprised if he were you actually go back to Basin and if under these want to try to play around this Dragon could be pretty powerful utilize packet for it when we bought my controller controller comes down by the drop off the vision away but hunted these have the most of their roster sheer as you can see if he's walked back down package I'll see if that retail comes to make more that happen if you can see how amazing is taking down Trump feeling comfortable himself is continue award battles Rage with his bottom River ocean Cricut mats in not yet taken out if he's really trying to keep tabs on it so you can see bang every once awhile to DSW over there they're trying to give you your reward over the wall a clutch want some Too Faced check into this now and they have a lot of power who need does Nya Style for Tuesday at top so Wikia 44 potentially but course he is going back to get package so now you have to feel like a hundred thieves do have priority in this 44 you know that actually such a big difference even the top when is trapping pretty heavily as well as potential for fake God to prevent who
