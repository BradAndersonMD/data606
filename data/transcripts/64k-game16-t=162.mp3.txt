after that it's only one game sample size tonight there and I respect the commitment it's your or a hundred you know if you're going to die you're going to do something freaky so I will see if he can bounce back and get first place tonight and I'm more preferable stat after this game playoffs themselves and I'm curious that does coming through downtown line or be to drop the game and you know there's there's penis in contention for a first part of the group of course we are going to Hampton dropping gear as well of course the person fudge were both on or Duty last day of the liquor self 1040 is it was a rough one but what time does an accident so that will get dropped off the table Joliet dropped off as well and so did Ali is going to be very quick lock in the black websiteI wonder if I die will just try to take away in one of those priority toppling or something cuz I think Mike combo with in Italy like if they're worried about me something like the community that we have seen all those types of picked you can go towards that of what the fudge is comfortable just answering with a different pic then they can just sit back and wait blabber to be on his Kindred this is really I think we're getting no Dillion type combo that he was playing in any of them is very good on a lot of these arrange jungler so I'm going to be excited to see Kindred it's not a champion we've been seeing a ton of we've been seeing as far as that the range of a kind of grave but not really a lot of Kendra and I think you know Kendra Ken work pretty darn well in this meta does scale very well as long as you're picking up Mark to get the additional ranged how you can be quite effective galio obviously a nice combo there alongside the Kindred you can timer galio ultimate as the kids are alt is expiring you come down you taught them up U-verse them down as they come out of that Kendra Dalton at low HP or at leastthe idea and also does feel like it setting out for potential third pic of a cavile a for fudge if life wasn't want to grab her right now and looks like they're not going to be going forward instead taking Hydro the Champions we see Jinn taken pretty early on blue side a lot so far NLCS login and has generally been the most highly prized to Port so not come through as well and if you want you can grab it and end up with two bands no problem in that can be caught ideally flying that style and then we'll see how that one runs down. They also put away put their head coach in reproducing this the first time it's denied it several years with a big kid have been coaching staff rain over now head coach for Smithy they're right behind him in a course for the first really dominant G2 era was with those did while playing together it's navigate to see what else can come through is it is the camile's you called out so good job is sale that big brain is what push all the hair out of your head and that you knowGalaxy brain yeah obviously it could be parks that are like we got last name for a working very well for them in the early game of course I wasn't really able to convert them to leave that he did a crew for himself alongside his teammates so I will see what time does want to do just the threat of the flex is always really nice affected when you are playing with its really pick like that having the possibility of a flight at least make your Florence consider that this could be going in either role and sometimes can dictate whether or not they would want to pick midlane right away here or save it for lateralrighty welt looking at the band coming through a midline Pam and a Top Lane band to preserve the syndra and one more to come through Aflac Westside and talk to Euless down by enough you know I'm not sure if it's Alice Through what you're going for I do kind of agree with the idea that it seems like galio is the mid laner here I just because it does piss a composition that said you know who knows I can do for you on anyway I mean you didn't actually pretty good. Good galio delivery Champions effect would be hardly surprised if his fortunes have been somebody passed will get to see her blade very often she's always seemed very strong as well and then to be part of a really tough matchup for Camille to taking that off is pretty night there's not a lot of other like Camille counters that people really seem to play in Pro play when you look towards solo queue people fly things like Darius sometimenothing that you really do see in competitive play hardly at all and then there is the more kind of extreme anthers like if you want to try to go for a range pick you can go towards things I like them but my guess is at this point we're just going to be a team fight comp we might be getting born again or even a malphite who I think can work pretty well into Camille early on I think I'm out they would fit well with this composition you have Ariana you have a lot of gold buttons there for the follow-up for the Shockwave pretty powerful. Did you know ultimate coming over the top 10 were pretty well also is there's a lot of squishy members over on cloud nine so that could be pretty nice of your will be really yeah this is exciting this is coming much more to that side lane play we have not been seeing what you're in a long time even when it has felt like it fits really well to Perry's a great shot are there is sometimes a little mini game working me a wolf joke. To the wall and then try to hold the hookshot or try to do it you know by pulling the furore right to the wall and then stand against it kneeling in front of the Pointe Blank ones you cannot reactEric because if you are going to react and Perry your hook shot and stun you with that is also reduced taxi dispatch that Perry and Dora can be one if you are able to do that that being said you're cannot do that Camille definitely does have some really nice trade-in to her and and does have the potential to win this one we want for this is going to be exciting top leaders trying to prove their worth Rite Liquors have replaced by this guy and busting out the Fiora against them licorice to get enough money to buy out perks to get the rest of my YouTube to take that buy out there so don't worry about it like fudge can just replace you like you just kind of been poured anymore so we've got room in the roster honestly it's it's not really even came out and they are brainless it's likeall right so if you're coming to match up with go right on the top side because it's going to be a I think he comes in as the expected the best player on this team on flag and he was stuck on on duty and it was a 0-4 start it was not pretty it ended 04 by the way as well as starting and were the exact same thing it wasn't it wasn't great but now he's back here he's on a big carry it's going to be a lot of stop playing also but I'm certain look at that one what is that because perks his camping gear to work alongside fudge so we're going to have to see how mxim Palafox can protect licorice from what feels pretty inevitable in a Galia World moving up toward that topside trying to attack if you are a yes you can try to save your Perry as that galio is coming in with the ultimate and then you're not going to have it for the Tom potentially or even the hookshot so it can be difficult to play around that but we'll see how flyquest is able to manageout there in that Top Lane because if your can get ahead that is a clear Side Lane wind condition but galio Camille always so frightening and park is going to be playing Predator so really wants to focus on the Rome wasn't expecting him to go rock it felt even help that more I didn't see if like West saw the word with out of the river but I've been impressed by every single game someone's like this with a wart is and possibly pretend they're right every time I know an in-game one or at least get me week after going to go we're lost. The T Ford in it's like okay expectation is that like this so it's probably there and was right it's still a present that these players no, Tennessee is there a bunch of everything and I'm right this is where they were we're going to get some extra golden XP and vision yeah so I'm pretty good start will be in to see how I was venting Vulcan her to be able to do down here against diamond and Johnson has been in Vulcan obviously were known as as one of the most dominant bot Lane in the ALCS especially in Spring they were absolutely crushing it and it is PGA on the MF I'm not sure where you stay at these bills I've been seeing a lot of people in high heel of go for the kind of comment here lethality styled build and I just looking to bully with it he's of poked that MF can bring a lot of the gym Builder the go boots for potions you can get out of the Dodge Make It Rain a bit more easily or just going to circle the sooner I feel like you to stay in really nicely so I don't get a lot of Headway doing a really heavy folk build in Al Ain like this little that you actually like change anything and then just before they all lens which are going to happen cuz Aleister Liotta so in this case I actually like him going for a more Auto tax base to build a fan of Debbie Maxon on MFM playing her more as an auto attacker place we're good and play around the devil up but regardless near the top side is canker sore to heal ready to fight for top Scuttle Natalie not far behind both top and Morty ward of that brush that they know what's going on but it's been licorice I had so far in the matchup I'm glad we're fighting over this one perks shows up first but the oryana close behind licorice now going to be here as well as fight fight going to ensue and it's going to go to Flubber pick up the first bark liquor in the bottom side how to walk away book really nicely done you can also see that use of the phase Rush allowing Vulcan to catch up with Jonathan to try to escape but not able to get out of there till about 9 winning on both sides they get the schedule and pop they kill off Johnson down in the bot Lane and they get his Bend to have the kill to hear this one more time Johnson just stepping forward a little bit too far involved in finding the opportunity to actually go for this as Johnson I think he's he just want to step toward actually get that for shot on his bed the Vulcan seize the opportunity to the splash Shield comes out but it's even see you immediately and then use her right back up slap the gin and sets up VIN for that Ezekiel meant up on my top side. The replay on this this might is nailed there by flaveur you can see the Perry came out from licorice but they just had to go back into a full Retreat and knowing that they were pretty far down in hell yeah it's like in different Excel as well was just a fraction of a second too early and set it up for this might come through anyway and get claimed by bladder there was also a box that's going to feel good Cloud 9 on the bottom side of a Vulcan obviously again a good job by the head of pulverize Johnson didn't Flash the head but he flashed after the Sun and as you mentioned phase Rush makes me taste that one so no big deal with the fact that you know what you can take it slow push put out of that use that to go for the dragon and his face was good not going to be denying much Farms been feels are reasonably safe get out he's got plenty enough to get away from diamond in most cases ultimately yeah liquor is quicker than that side of the map and Italy's going to begin the Dragon and it is pretty scary now for Johnson as well because if you are pushing up you know the Vulcan cells is flash drive in diamonds going to have to be there to try to break up any potential Q flash into a head but backwards style of combo very dangerous you can see blabber is down here and very likely is going to look for that Q Flash and try to head-butt Johnson back so they have to back it up on this Dragon they haven't spotted Johnson flash season trouble Johnson shut down easily be well start plus the Dragon z9r smashing so far they are looking so good already and Johnson play for the plated Steel Cast with flash and flash to expect for it was going was not the gas Palafox with Bays restaurants in a kind of wager on the way out but it means that he's getting back up 30 couldn't get away I was going to say poop difference down there with the fact that first has more boost 3059 they are looking really really good already in asking a question when you are falling behind this early on I know you have never really been a fan of nothing rolled it just got spotted we was dragging he's already very low it down he didn't want to just try to stay around so just kind of getting caught out there Johnson separated from his team is jungle a very low on the Dragon no flash on Jen so he gets taken down very easily they lose the dragon and he's got way behind itemization to be honest to you know this is not going to be doing much of anything stir if only he let us kill shot in time would have been a 1/4. The reply Quest but they will stay off the board licorice he's able to keep himself alive but he's going to lose a lot of farm down there in his help keep that 480 Carrey alive Jen got the news feed about the armor to not quite. Ms so quickly that that was just doesn't seem like a villain in any problems but if you get that we've stalled out so if you're out of man in your kind of stuck in that awkward position licorice could actually taken all in and probably kill you fudge you can see his old was already on cool down here to Mrs oakshott a pretty critical Rome they are from Parks to reset the way from 5 to really help him out cuz he didn't have to be he didn't have any manner and in that one V one in that position are you are either going to get the way Frozen on you or you're going to get killed by licorice so a good job I purchase helping out but you it was having a little bit of trouble and that one's you want and now if I put the top hair old is that one spawns up we've got the porch railing over the 80 carries doing the same as vents in Bates walking your buddy is already left on that one the I can be popped by train for a while though and
