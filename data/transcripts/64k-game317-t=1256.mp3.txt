we CTL going 4-1 3-1 style of game twitch can really throw a wrench in the gears for that being able to show up in stealth assassinate people in those side lengths given get really really tough with the early when you're in a rough do we do against the rain support and now is Olaf in early aggressive jungler who is he really tough your 49er pobelter Olaf you for a highly prized Wrangler get through the wash as we Rise Against Cloud9 throughout play artist we've heard a lot of stories about their strength from camping bid with a ghost coming through with a lot of Earlhas been able to snowball those out of control and we're getting the switch have changed in the jungle to help hair grow make a comeback or the addition of the extra Mana regeneration from your Talisman through the river is one of the most the jugglers that's why a lot of time they had a very slow start however that and a couple of the extra movement Talent have been very big and bringing him back and he really wants to see what kind of a bill he's going for here as well if he wants to run straight into a try 4th and goal that really aggressive style for if he's going to be playing something more like a center hole CDR I think I might want to be a little bit more tanky just considering he is the only one that will be building51 I demand a little bit morealright sticky on the twins. This is the first which we have had all split and the last time it was picked was in week 4 of Spring by Arrow but see if he can bring it out here to 6:10and if the real question here to be a cow sneaky and Angel are going to be able to do in this to be to match up it's against the Morgana it's against is a with a flea for work and that it's going to be tough for this lethal Tempo twitch just arrived I think it's very important that we're seeing an early invade here because I said I from is one of the most romantic and kinds of jugglers security is very important for this Champion you need to get your first clear off on Heckler I'm so that you can go back and buy the boots to use predator for your first game it's very critical the first 3 minutes for blabber and that's why they're trying to defend what team liquid got a lot of good information there with the invade the clever going to be starting red with the leash are we can see Jensen is going to be going inspirational secondary for the time warp tonic likely for biscuits here as well be able to sustain Peru NE Fridley pressure that the rise can put on because the early levels can be fairly tough for malzahar in these matchups but once you get a couple levels once you get my lost after going you really can wait there almostI look like my brain is going to go over to the crows to your so much more golden experience in this small camp after the jungle adjustment that might mean that we'll have some sort of Confrontation over the Scuttle crab but Olaf likes to get low for the extra attack speed in his jungle and will be able to secure the rest of his blue quadrant and Team Liquid should know the jungle pathing of Labrador there is a ward book over there after they knew he started for bread because the leash from Gangplank and they were where they haven't got a rapid just yet that camp is still there so he's going to jump the camp entirely but I think I'd go get some more Mana for himself isn't going to go for either Scuttle so Smith you can see on the mini-map is already trying to take over top Scuttle where is bladder is going to be on the bottom side and we'll see if it dueling protein liquid was Secure the bottom level 14 liquid to get both of them and secure the vision yeah it looks like they're going to be able to do it they have already grabbed that's a really nicely done your from TL in the early levels using aMorgana Kaiser pushing in we're going to remove the resistance is from a Scuttle for an easy kill on the bottom side able to push up double lift in Oley with priority in the bottom Lane Work lyrics on the Olaf going very efficiently not much distance traveled between his camps and he'll be able to end on plug on the bottom side of head again want to mention that TL dueling grabbing extra camp on top of that one so certainly is stronger clear the Raptors still waiting to be taken on that cloud 9 release him held up in a little bit won't find the sun though and she look at able to reset off this once you have that possibility then the mid laner also have to worry so pobelter on the rise might need some extra vision for himselfand you can see I'm playing towards the bottom side of that lane a little bit because he has more Ward coverage down there they have a Scuttle is well want to protect himself from any potential gains that would come in from the topside and you know the barber will be going through those Raptors first or anyting else ice pick up there's Bolton knocks down a couple of little boys as well as they are not too heavily hurt in this Lane should be able to get himself to his email outfits laying on the table to double list self and take him down Smith is going for the first gang cure bladder is close behind though so they had to be careful about diving proof liquid answer was watching but the cue hits anyways basil flashing directly on top of double is unable to get out and once you get connected with that stun you are going down there by sneaky and Zazzle what are the rookies for Cloud 9 coming up with the big play meanwhile on the top side to do a veteran impact and Smithy or able to take down licorice licorice though he did have the money or the time he died that is an important power specs the matchups is going to feel a lot better with the ques band has gone klepto now as far as part of the reason you have more money is there but maybe the durability would win a different when I can't came through I'm going to be okay also impact shooter's name on the tank very good CS for himself early on vs. licorice on the on the Gangplank ER but it looks like Midland might be the area that thought I want to focus on neck because the malzahar has hit the all-important level six steps to his ultimate try to hold rise and place for the heck of to run through so I wasn't worth mentioning that the infernal to be a big ticket item here especially for C9 because they're running such a heavy damage composition would really get a lot of the extra a D in AP and blabber down on the bottom side fears of Autumn Lane can't get a kill or push up a potential girlfriend but right now they're going to have me out farmed about three to four camps behind its level 6 to level 5 has not yet found a way to see what himself in this game qvar good damage was pretty close as well very close to that was Lance a double can also get off another Auto attack to practice plasma and a huge chunk of damage 50 head down to the bottom side though to S west of Health in the vision for 4 SS in Oley the first blood was also big year for sneaky because it allows him to get there early Vamps after as well as the boots size that makes on those findings and also likes killing through any potential post there from the Morgana so a lot of that to his advantage that steel drafted for is now gone I wish you would happens though as if I've had a goalie for Team Liquid meets an overall laning phase victory that is jungle in Top Lane mostly we're now five 9 or without summers in the bottom layer going for the topside get a spot out Jen's been that way does a rabbit live outside blabber out of him pack his back to safety pretty fast but not quick enough to catch in front of the ultimate here and in fact that was very close but he gets out alive baby blabber is going to have to be careful as in Smithy is ahead in that farm he is level sick. Could be looking for a fight without ghost or whatever. liquid are able to get one back for themselves but this one be a kill infernal Drake as you stated earlier will be a huge fry there to be one kill by The Binding in the all-in is completed used stuff now for TLC rental Drake that was going to feel good as 9cs lead he can recall for everybody wants to as way to get stubs in really important for their that's what you always mention getting those deep rewards into the enemy jungle flabber heading down on the heck of over that wore that they can see him now at his Rob and give up that gang we have gotten some answers now blabber going to work as his first item is not going to be able to look into style triforces really aggressive bills but here it is one more time on the bottom side work on it in the brush out of vision hear from sneaky in find the perfect opportunity splashed all finding Point Blank just perfectly done from LA to pick up conversation has also been around the bottom playing Duo working with Olay their communication issues how to split but they have definitely been working together very well in recent history and it just goes to show right there even though they got first blooded they're able to pull off the play out of it has he done they're taking stock respimat piddling basically equal a quicksilver sash rushed in for both or he's not going to be that all this game we do something have the ultimate available for a bladder tack room as well as gangsta for I meant nothing to him down do you think it is a really intelligent purchase therefore pobelter though it's not going to be under any sort of solo kill pressure should have the freedom now on rides to be able to shove a Lane Bryant look for a realm or place to help out the bottom Lane DL heard it in SS MVP speech that the team looks a lot of faith in him to put the resources in him they're happy to play around him. Love has been there all star absolutely get the key the league and we'll see. Press come down that's really worth noting to that it is the klepto as you pointed out earlier on the GP we're so used to seeing brass now you're not really a custom seen that thang like if you do get a lot more gold so despite the fact that he's going to be getting a lot from that klepto and we'll get to that Triforce at a pretty fast clip be ready for those who fights already we're seeing 50 work with pobelter rotate to the river with his jungle predator on the rise old laptop that can find me but no roof know what he says he wants to transfer stays alive nicely traded back and forth their Jensen does have to lose for the elite if you could look to attack in nice finding go here from Olay workout has been one of olay's longest Champion that we have known him on finding some very good binding fear and on this big stage and as you can see doublelist I see pretty good stats for him as well this summer average reigning Champion is something about 421 5.7 kts it's either going to rise that score throughout this game 1200 Golden Tee looking out the top way I'm expecting to see if mostly just kind of utility Paladin's you're coming out of impact he's not building more for the ones you want I don't expect to see anything like it nice Warren I getting that righteous Glory early on it just going to increase his ability to Rolling creases ability to look for those engages we had to do was go with the rise of the glacial augment Scion when you completed the right before you would also latest Cloverfield on the grout afterwards but this time around you stack the extra help with the grass another rotation here through pobelter and Smithy to have it cleared out the vision in the river though so glad I should be
