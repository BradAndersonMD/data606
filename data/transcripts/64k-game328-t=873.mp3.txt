play skins on the docket 5 and 3 both these records rapper Foxy third-place been in Dripping Springs hundred fuse spinal it's from the last what will happen I didn't see it first place teams going head-to-head right now and we keep on bringing up both of them you don't want to represent North America at World's End this is going to go a long way and get him there a doctor in the air check ridiculous is either Thalia or Zoe whichever one blew through here and that's a simple early pic by the way is the way that hundred season 5 game win 3 came to an end golden Guardians Mickey like legendary I think he was 8 and a lot of focus against are you in the Midland from the jungler as well and pretend that he's willing to give that away because he would rather not deal with our talks Grey's girl. Probably has been the best performing echo-fox player so far this I think I was kind of a 1 V 500 right there but enough for these locking in rakan for aphromoo and we will see if we're going to lock in this vile ones by that leaves well visits can still be a fun game for Kodi saint of coerced or it's going to win for right now for fun do I talk to a lot of the teams they much prefer this Duo because Dad work on so quickly ultimate keep their safe and she actually doesn't have to wake you for lunch food scale out she can have an impact really early on unlike some of the other longer killing fun inside hear Morgana has been another highly prized pick Black Shield incredibly important in the current state of the game size of garlic on a very good dueling overall just definitely not Graves here for taking over a game at the Box going to stay there at Fox Lane Marksman or whatever picture all text and the top winner for the second round of 16 years as going to be going to lock in a Vladimir like at the beginning of the Season 4 for the majors make up a lot of ground right I'll take a dub satterlee going on the Vladimir and it has become one to Stay With Champions you talked about bacteria plus video Spot Lane with like Vladimir + x mid rundown of Atlanta had like the Cody sun tunnel in the mid so I don't know which lane is playing for a funnel midlane with robot land of last last week for a actually had and on the wreck on doing the phone apart from the jungle as well and probably gave an interview afterwards when he talked about certain things that Honda has opened up for them actually he also gave a little anecdote on how to say the name he says and does his name is Andy, try and stick that so many people have taken kind of like High Road pronunciation of on done with guns very pretentious technically would be fun but everyone called him things were going to go ahead and use the words that I his teammates do but FYI because I'm no longer as dumped you know I second phase advance of going away plaque and Soraka removed to be a funneling support jungle mid whatever a wreck on with a real support in the bottom line approach you think marching bands has no solution for all that an accurate assumption and it is probably going to be that supports 10 from the bottom side skin works so well instead in up a lot of pp Combos and he's going to give you more freedom if your photo composition wants to get aggressive and have the duo you know especially like the record if you got his gen ultimate on top of the work on that really strengthens be engaged and fast can a semi blind pick the Gangplank in Ocean cam go top CP should be season answer into it and oh please do this early so a lot of times I caution against taking Top Lane matchups that can be easily swung by jungler Intervention when you're running of no cop is a dead that's why they kind of backed out from the crowd but Darius still have fuel pressure on a gangplank you really have to do interesting thing it turns out that it is photo composition and right here potentially as a sort of the Quasi jungle pick code for the old ones only one running Smite right now I am out the price of his death on the funneling team to the chapel with no escape tools on his own and hard-won between Gangplank trundle things difficult where is ribbon could at least try to get away from the game coming in so I either way hundred thieves and probably thought that's the right choice for this but I am surprised I mean Dairy it does have a lot of your individual power it when the current Day the game however your weakness that you're pointing out for him especially against a trundle the pillar is we have your flask and the pillar to get a lot of mileage not only the kind of Enoch back but as well work done from the Flow by the way dr. Mundo undrafted in this game we are not in yet in this one part of that sort of one of the good pitching dr. Mundo when I was about to Blind a tackle box to come up with their who he is on a Kerry trundle we'll see if that I can support him very well this will be heard their coach talk about who needed a little more help so that he can pop off in these games we ready to go Echo Plus 1st husband receives ready to rock a battle over first place in the North American LCS and we are ready to go into the game top of the standings baby all right we have one sweeper picked up this is what I've been tracking it a lot of the early games here I really like to see at least one person picking up the sweeper usually the jungler so that you can sweep any of these early Wards trying to get in early experience bonus for one of your laners or solo laners are probably make the best use of it cuz they can hit level two on the first wave and our dock is the only guy here on the field right now that does have a sweeper budget that more people on the top side and they might try something a little bit sneaky here as they might pull a pincer movement on Tony's on the one side walk to the other three and a middling support of Reckoning is going to be off when playing a dedicated bottling so just like last time you saw this they are kind of plane to those lengths ocsa switch around back and forth over time but yeah Cody Sun going to play. Mid lane Sia funnel Sia with Ryu in the bottling Vladimir and again I like that some of the teams have settled into this sort of a swap Ryu is a mage player he's been playing Majors for years and years and years he's a great Vladimir put him on the bottom are just put in bottom of that remove those guys can work it out meanwhile Cody son has look by far the best on Markman and he's going to have a lot of extra gold with this but only strategy you want to start on the red-eye and is going to go try and catch those minions so he he does not any of them is used on the first one and just as they get to the turkeys actually going to miss all of the melees yeah and that is 60 Gold straight of lost right there at the XP went solo victory over to and of there and I'll draw. didn't quite learned that affect their butts going to have no problem taking over that part of the Jungle so far though Dry Dock has not kind of jungle juice will help a little and they didn't have it so they know that you taking out this blue quadrant that's why we see the double Cody sun and movement here over to the Scuttle crab they're just going to move on up grab that one and they might be able to go for a buff as well before going back it looks like they're not going through as they want to fully shove in this wave on damontay before they head back to the blue project for some more fun than sitting in the landsraad equating on the way. Is level 3 raid you're going to be there tomorrow or going to be lanced restart Blaze Down The Hammer here early on even though they know he's in the blue quadrant is a pillar and recalling all right you've definitely seen a ton of kill themselves in the camper weigh nothing happened there at least nothing negative happen for them I consider opportunity cost and negative Kobe anyways fully misses the pillar here after taking out the funnel Duo let's go back to a happier time for echo-fox success story where it's really mostly about the Sleepy trouble bubble that Demonte Wayans to set this up right that allows dogs have to walk up a right next to him get this low from the bike and an easy clean up there for tomate a it would have grabbed the first kill is the reaction to the whipping is triangle filler they're going to try zero to inform me when there's a jongleur who's known for being proactive against just back-to-back Gangstar 4 dock in the mid lane gets demerits for the Top Lane Miss but someday on the top side actually still holding on to his Flash and getting away there no teleport so if he goes and he completes its recall he's going to miss out on a lot of minions is funi on the Gangplank once again having a very strong game for himself and he's got the full pressure and afraid of enemy of course you can see the entire plot line stuck under the threat there is no actual jungler so. I can continue to kind of jungle Enfield transfer the jungler out farming the funnel they're smashing it's it's a little bit one-sided here where most people inherently dip like funnel compositions approved for the Anderson if there's a pair of right for contacts that I've used this little drowsy time to dump away I mean that's what they say they should almost always be doing because it has the mobility not level six and use the flash early on so Cody said it has no escapes dark though just on a Warpath here camping for Demonte just like I said in champ select free Zoey picked early this happened to touch of these last week it was a Joey Pick 4 go to Guardian contract also Camp mid and they were able to get the victory here let me look so good for Sunday and then he lost half his help anyway who'd he is just actually fashion this Lane right now he's got about a 7cs lead and shove going in as well as well and what are the changes that we see you running away and setting it up really nice move there from afro mood pop flashes Andre you get this. Channel off flat Amir damage comes through getting a kill back and they really needed area on the map were there because that's where I know it's a hundred thieves bottom side is going to be their focus mean wild are. Still looking here up on the top side booty has been just fooling someday with his grasp Gangplank and the full on Jungle advantage or just that one but yeah this is a huge advantage or maybe he's level five Gangplank is 6 and he's getting experience at all Africa me to help they can spot him now there is no flex is going to get pretty easy top killer on the run and go to join in as well as fight over the Red Bluff. Fight his dogs out but it just everywhere right now though under attack show me a windsor 4700 Alpha scoreboard is on the board and 100 these are not going to take this one like you like to see better in our spring split MVP trying to make them early gameplay if I take antenna going out there as well pillow
