there's only major questions that I kind of have coming into this one look at the most common champions for Santora's first blood king of the LCS the first part of the world would you even look at all the other top the top performer there if you get them on a trundle for a pillar or something like that it went really salty because he could pull the trigger and they can leave so low on food like the Gangplank to display sweetie times before flyquest are not letting up in Italy bands game ticket sites like with the loss they say all right will take red deal with it he probably expects you know that it is finished now because coming out of yesterday I was thinking calm and sense could be just keep it for TSM they're going to flex it between jungle and top cuz they don't want to pick up early an adult hits solo would be willing to pick it fly to try to absorb the pressure and have relevant Elsewhere on the map but I did like that flyquest know it's wrong to one side of a kind of the spectrum as far as if you're going to play against a 1-3-1 you either have to draft a match the 131 we have to draft the punishment 3 man squad with the soul of this was right and they went hardcore with Nautilus Plus plus Oriana speed up hard engage point-and-click PC they were looking to bring out here it will be Turtle do off of Santa who you don't know what the analysts that's with the big fan of and did honestly help out solo some in that silent having this an alternative back you up and be pivotal in those types of scenarios Caitlin obviously incredibly strong Marston they're not willing to do that over so it's just going to be Kaitlyn versus that Ash apps that every single time it says come over and over and over again to play for most of last week because like lifting a load of the top bracket to get either TSM bertila play against then they're going to play one of those two over and over again they must have seen that they couldn't be pollution game the split and they could never handle it and that's it but to to put too much pressure on that window other Marksman Orban seems unlikely never being left out that they couldn't beat that inscription to look we've put in the practice against we know we can't do it we're going to keep that off the table go ahead and play Aztec clearly teeth I want this and fly plus 4 in flexible in their van because they know what to use empty well with and that's exactly is viewers can't see but these teams clearly understand if they're playing the games out I think it's a great choice here by the way to be strong team fight before it gets banned away from flying power people so this is the first kind of inflection point does beer go back to TF back to the sideline or they go for a little longer Sandra or something a bit more aggressive and try to really go out how are we will end that would kind of signal that they want to look more towards thermostat they want to look more towards v v v fighting black let's head to head and that is going to be the change here I thought there was opportunity for MBR accent wheel lock in that tender his career most played Champions everyone was talking about the zillion but you can't forget about this Sandra he has been a monster on it for years and years and years and now I'm really curious does this mean that you have time is going to fully opt out of that book wished like will they still go for the Jacks will they still look for a Camille or are they just going to go to war more of a straight-up Bobby V South Off winner something like the Border Kaiser something like a tank of their own and looked really just play or the team fight and try to outplay flyquest in that scenario good chance we see something come through like wow it just think they're sticking hey you know set-top may still be the case because the game one as well by the way that's like West in the second phase of band through a couple of jungle bands and in case vent wet set with up there a couple enforcement for unknown for is Evelyn and play it here as well they must have seen that he had put it in the plasma cells and what is it and screams there as well and so need some couple final bands come through worth pointing out the gate by TSM I think he's the king of weeks I top laners has the way we could you could you don't lose your trip when you get dope and mordekaiser off the board as well as like I'm going to throw into support fans on top that's probably as if you want to go a middle ground you could still go Jace and cuz Dave can play for a for pushing top and get an advantage and a group and still do you bite especially if you're looking for a kind of an earlier Spike alongside that then dry you're making with Jace what's the sender is going to be really really strong for that v e 5 pill that is an option if they want to kind of go somewhere in between like hard commit Side Lane. identify any flights this is very interesting to me that he does so much his game has has moved around on how much pressure has been topside and getting a good backup that you enjoy Jake's is going to be blind here thinking that shoulder baseball outfit has worst to get in the blind dates here instead or they really really care about the Fort Magic which of course relevant here as well don't get me wrong. We're caught is by far the most played bass left in the pool for the matches for the certainly there for the comfort side and like what's a note where to go back for engaged we still like ignore on a playmaker and he will beat the rakan is up he says base the champions in the board if that's dangerous here for the knock back a lot. Pantheon it's better for me if we are going to chase here and I'd like what else is in solos pool they really worried about right words band GPS band Shannon fan Lucian is banned in other potential like really aggressive fixed so it probably expecting the orange and if you're okay just playing for pressure and playing for push on that Jace I think it is totally fine to Blind that cuz they all right I'm going to have priority tops for to be able to play for Dragons renewal play for schedules will have push with the center will have push and priority with that Jace second match up fairly well against at volibear and then if you leave your support Pick 4 last and you get a counter in that support to be to that you have a winning Lanes potentially three ways and you can play heavily for the early Dragon stacking try to get yourself into a situation similar if they did in game number one where they are heavily ahead as far as the objective as far as the dragon and then try to force us to come to you at that third dragon fight be ahead and gold be ahead and power and dominate there and on the other side it's going to be up to fly quest to try to withstand that Onslaught to try to utilize but they're really really strong scaling here and to avoid the pantheon attacking this Jason picking on the Jade because unlike with the Jackson aside land adjacent definitely died to a norm plus Pantheon Yeah Yeah Yeahs call certainly in these Lanes you have flu Escape out has Morgan Elaine overall that situation that TSM is in is I am a fan of santorin and hizbullah there you can get in there and get stuff done the question is can he do it here in this crucial game 4th TSM are still on Match Point flyquest must-win to keep this finals alive otherwise dies in Walking trophy black women certainly love to get their first it be the first year as well as across-the-board across-the-board question is can they get over the Finish Line afterwards call to find out we are into potentially the final game here flyquest obviously would have to continue that reverse sweep they looked so much better in that last game they do have some good engage options here they do have those go buttons but that the pantheon support you know I remain unconvinced that I do think it is a very risky pic to be going back towards you have to be playing from ahead you have to be able to push the pace with this text because when you are behind on it it has no fallback plan it does damage and it goes in and that's about it used to a lot of it coming into this series all time with a barely Katie above one but wasn't engaged in this is just I'm just a man who is famous for as you hear the story retold eventually he couldn't really play Architects Sports back on the very famous Misfits roster where they took SKT to five games and so he brought out for Leona as the answer to the Ardent censer meta and did pretty well he did he did great on it but he's always been an aggressive roaming support kind of player where he's going to get in there to make the big blazing you know set up for the tea and then ignore has had a very good split plank dance like this brush work on Pantheon. That's his wheelhouse here and yeah the man who could look pretty bad like you're going to enjoy but you can try to get out of that lane and I will say the differences in fall back between a threshing work on and the pantheon is pretty extreme right because we're always has the ability to get those multi-man CC's multi-man knock UPS play it more defensive has the ability to peel utility of the lantern to slow the box is just like you and become very difficult are you do have incredible potential to Rome with a point-and-click cc that is very strong but there is kind of a timer on it you got to be able to make things happen you got to be able to keep getting aggressive when we saw come out earlier wasn't able to find that affect me so we'll see if you can this time around so far for both 80 carries the first push goes over the flak West Waverly early Ward comes down from PSI vs Gastelum starts the word to see if he's coming down early on for some kind of really really early about before they come here where there's not a lot of surprising crowd control I got a Pantheon jump and that's it and if I can walk away and you know. Even if needed and I feel afraid they're from speed up TV going for, at 2:10 to do with rage matchups and tries to fly to the to the 110 that Pantheon son is that is twice now that he has gone up or fat summoner against this specific Champion Yorkton running very low on men here obviously he is playing for the teleport but you know what power of evil sitting in a more comfortable position if he can get that push you can reset the way I can save it all apart will still getting off at base and that's going to put him in a pretty darn nice spot for finds a couple in the ice pick up there from the bottom scuttles going to make the bottling feel safe without a lot of pressure right here at the Blacklist do is just hard pushing the two on two right now finished putting fight back and forth there as well as if it takes a dammit TV does the same and we got ourselves a pause the future and you have our faces on camera again that's true hopefully we will be able to get this pause sorted out quickly hop back in but until then we can talk a little bit more about the series about this sort of a matchup it is one of those things where you do expect Morgana in Ash to have the push and I do think that they should but the one caveat is that you have to respect the potential of Tanks coming through no Volver plus that Pantheon is that is a very strong will stun combo yes you have the Black Shield but if black child is born song cool down or if you get a flash done on one target you flash a once on the other these types of plays that you can look for perhaps they can get punished if they are over pushing so they just to be somewhat careful about that but up on the top side know we can see the Broken Blade actually did go for the call so I'm kind of curious if he is going to go back towards and we're scaling style of play and I we haven't seen him go for anything other than just really sality but there are options such as universal or scaling feels like going for the tyr build and trying to play more heavily towards like Amazon alrighty walk still go back to this way you can see the farm pretty equal up the topside although there is more for Brooklyn Define so we should be taking it seriously eventually it dark for the Deep Ward plays and actually I mean look how low gear going to stay in for so long but I think they got hay but missing but still you can see XP and gold Awards he sent torrent and Dierks it is just not in Lane right now and if you're still be able to be back in won't lose too much ignore can put toward unpack speaker and that means about like a flea but be careful because what great time as slow down to 150 back tonight during that mid-length not losing anything on that bottom side and you were jumping biofrost out signing and back to basin who's experienced and gold off of a couple minions including the Canon which can feel pretty painful in early stages that being said he got two words that here who is going to be comfortable as far as the man that goes he can continue holding on in this Lane farming it out and once you get six of your threat is going to do a lot up there is a potential then of gangs in a really looking to to take down power of evil and I'm going to be curious to see if TSM can establish push on that bottom side and start moving towards stacking some of those dragons those kind of expecting that they might look for with this type of draft I've been going back and forth right now small farm in a few we we are going for the Farmingdale by the way up here to me. Power truck picked up to your he picked up exactly 0 combat stats it was already getting bullied around in this Lane how are people forced to 6 sports playing for war controller on midlane but look at that describes Lewis perfect mid-length push level 650 is here and that means the warts go away it is Ragan is almost certainly a Target looks like like us will make that first move and we can see the speaker is up on that top side maybe going to try to go for solo has been kind of the Ritz Northeast Academy field for TSM bottom size velour is potentially on an option to try to force them off a little bit but with power of evil having the shop right now in mid-length lanes are going a lot better for expect it has been really good stuff the first reason come again means you always get the push on the first wave that comes in right in front so that was like a coniferous recall is going to be going down so 6:40 into the game as X exhaust what do you want the first to go back to the late and faces so far so good for so long top side is spelled Buckhorn by the way we have seen grass before the melee matchups you look at the grass because Jay Siegel spell book for some other kind of power instead allows him to ignite for trades or goes cleanse away from CC and that may
