are you playing tomorrow or Sunday there's no there's no double elimination they cannot get first because EG has already guaranteed that but dignitas if it would hear there was a top for the group they're playing quarters it's going to be fine if they do that's fun I think it's really important here if they're going to ban to Leah or not I like leave this up as the question for 9 to leave the one jungle champion at did guys have a win on right now for gardocki look really good at it as an elective 20 Deck with pointing out the jungle matchup is so big for these two teams because bladder has been the biggest carry just why all the hype around perks you know coming over to North America palabra has been huge and carry Nampa and Italy it is left up so now we get to pick or is it going over to the other sidecancel first pick to Lionel Lee comes in right after their dogs going to go to that one as well we always ask what is the Mythic that was going to go for it as much as I like designs in the 2021 season Sakura like they pick Lillian she has like four items choices which an outstanding late-game carry going to be in love with a belly Austin I went through this. Where did everyone hated himself but I think is it in a very good state right now it's simply very strong and Ice Cube you choose to eat by potential especially once you start I know accumulating your items but allistars a really good pic into a pile of not looking out Hearts do you see here it's another really important thing when you first pick to Leah you're always lookingsolo laners that also have hearts easy to set Billy up because that makes her devastating easily Lander seismic shove that's where these big Wombo Combo has come from those things like rain next in also looking for possible to set up in Midland to to give you versatility and to allow perks the Roman work with Lattimore and so is going to be that kind of slowed things down maybe you can lend someone away if they're coming out to Alistair lens that but through pulverized where the seismic shop in the new Housewives there before your flashes every ending pasta bowl so can be really scary their local bands going away for a skirt out of here you could gather again I'll stable here as well. Do you want to see how fudge end up doing cuz he's not been outstanding but why is Bill fighter going to drop the table for most deep youngest player in the LCS and came in talkingexcitement to the games we'll see see how he bounces back this week definitely struggled a little bit early on a proxy error with the second round bands are there may have some of the sea all around or top laners the healing right now is really really strong on eight. So he's come back as one of the favorite blind pics and put thing to us are probably going to have to stop and save their mid for last pic trying to whittle down on the generalist top laner could blind fix guitar Spanaway Laurel to get rid of some more the midline option Sarah first we'll see what comes through plenty of options available down the line As Time ticks down I'm your wreck in Oregon that's kind of what kind of third in line to take us over something like a reactant in a lot of cases but hahayou know technically a blind. Late but we've seen so many teams punished minion are and attacked these Nar flares early on that it it makes it look like no such a weakness so dick. So I could fall into that trap they do with the other one it is Gangplank very good at absorbing freshener using the ultimate you do for a wave clear as well you have a lot of options with how you want to play Gangplank you can play Super aggressive Leaf off the bat level one user packs if you do you're going to have to declare Pathak topside to do my dance in the rain just barely hear they'll pop the Peril stay out of the range of a barrel of the Baskervilles jungler with means you can still put pressure in and get orange out of sight Midland for 9good match up really early on I am really really looking forward to the level one possibilities here though detox with a Lilia and a threat can definitely go for that level one in Vape play Far Cry by swap Authority on Toledo Bend or there's a chance but they stopped pact was fine but I was like I said there was a possibility that we're going to Jason's probably a better syndra Mattapan or E might be normal stuff down here good like it carries them both sides to follow up the EZ of course to lie again old and Lantern to bring Kelly s or a jungler or someone else and I'm not expecting bottling is the place of all players in this game Vulcan is the one with a hundred percent First Blood rate so if there's a if there's going to be a kilt if you are in bottomland with Venturi X or over to Mid for perks but you know the mass right now is going to be smoking as far as the first week of the walking wet he has been farming up a storm highest yes 4 minutes of any player on any of the teams and he's also been a huge huge point for bladder to then go work off towards the bottom side of the map so definitely agree with the focus they're not too surprised about the general esteem cops that they've been looking for this way to try and secure themselves a spot in the quarterfinals though very important match for them absolutely took the toss can they lock themselves in we got to see there will only be a tiebreaker game if there is a three-way tie involving the dignitas Immortals and flyquest otherwise it's five games today in altizer broken based on game time and such only tiebreaker if there's a Battle Force 5 full a recall stop there for bladder even though I'm going to the same work around and you know now he knows and if you want manaflow band you got to stack there but you know he's a dick it could be there alright let's see if there's a delayed invade actually almost always was he the jungle lyrics drop your trinket War then recall to switch back over to your sweeper as dark as especially for Lily and he's going to do pretty much mostly a full clear tries to get all our camp cycling before getting to active got the better of that trade 4th what's the origin of ball is close by you can just can't miss the cuso4 to Look Alot of q auto leave it at the same help our leader the passenger right now there was a fight back and forth for level two pork steaks EQ gets one back in pretty actually the Namek the early Winfrey's do with the corrupting potion to get plenty of Regents you can kind of survive this. If I don't think you just like texts Bells forever otherwise they're going to run out to leashless start on the blue 2 minutes but I can't is finally done so it's going to be a bit of a slow start is bot Lane wanted to make sure that getting late in time I mean it ain't like the reference Alistair you really don't want to have to come to Lane late or you're just going to have to drop CS like there's a hole just way that plays out and she never really fun so we go down to the lowliest a too sad about you don't know Leaf starts very good job hiding early on so you save so much HP can see you didn't have to use any post slick Willie up as long as you don't kind of just pants and date them and you actually use the passive roast beef and guide the camps around properly just fine and clearing it help or not nice like right there to be a lot of damage to the flaking is well and that is why you didn't take a fight Vulcan can never engaged or he will just dyed afro Neil with an ignite and I'm going to give see night so much less pressure in this lame down yes big opening here for aphromoo and Neo there were a bunch of questions circulating around the sin cos roster one of them was that aphromoo after putting in so much work last year and be coming and you know part of that big bottom Lane Forest for dignity how is he going to do try to raise a fund another new rookie in MiO me know after getting another shot here name change in all coming in so far pick it up right where they left aggressive play here with your failure scratch try to push the lane in trying to die some of those menus and retain control of bottom half of the map. I believe showed himself going over the sea salt the same Kentland the W does not live it's really good sites that buy perks means he's like I was a mole diver I'm going to go outside if it's cold down here honestly not not too big of a deal just keep on power farming through as you can see to blabber having done red side first gets to go over to Super high-value cruggs second spot of frogs feel so good that's why I love starting red and doing right side first clear for Tulia especially she has a really easy time of clearing that camp and and black was going to have a pretty big boost as far as the experience leave here. Meanwhile does get the second reset off a little bit later but Russia's Level Two Boots Lucidity has been gaining so much popularity Pro junglers trying to rush this with the with the ability hate as well really really does make a difference for Lilia I think of it is unlocked based on getting 5 slide off and he has some very good jungle clear staff because I can't get the sooner you can earn more gold by running faster and that's obviously pretty important they are as well they're trying to get the recalls office ways in a bad spot done can not leave the wave here but it's tough but you know can you really go for the play as well can get soaked he's just kind of going to die and it turns out to Lee is right behind them or so I can stay lilies are behind them leave the lights on the map stop it only person help with the extra speed Lance's bowling ball is well after calibrating at mid-day able to kill on his bed both Summoners implode for Sven and I was just talking about at the beginning of the intro as being dissed huge Kerry Forest for cloud nine they been playing so well honestly that was a well-controlled lane State buydig they went for the interests of the recalls they had to ward in that lane brush that stall Cloud 9 cancel on the reset and they do with the jugular position they were going to have it on our light Goldstar tickets cloud nine one of the biggest failures freak is when top laners continue to show up after they receive a gang from their own junk flapper recalls are goes back to his own jungle after helping a push up there then you're so exposed get you still feel like you have this relative safety as the top winner they just had your jugular come and gang for you so darn socks able to slip in just bottom side play the top side play level six billion ow oh my goodness. He's really set up here reporting to talk to rule this early game by next ice would be towards the dragons to say do have that bottom control having gotten off the successful gank towards that already and burn both his Summoners and establishing this jungle lead dig if they wait for the next school down for fake God's ultimate I think that is that is that should be 100% and their Drake look at it. I can see how it raining outside of Minion Vision wait for the flash for a free movie starts moving beautiful plastic wrap over by the way of the way that they'll are there so you see me immediately went for their gratitude there as soon as the client came off though. Already through the seed get the slow there enough to chase him down honestly just so beautiful so that you know they did double up on anything that would get double cleanse there anything like that yeah you by mention I might not have heard it but after holding off on at night until the gravity route was cleanse like us another one that would just go away if you could steal flashlight big night so really good stuff all across the board to Old startles you mentioned is a 1,000 gold difference that is kind of what you expect with 7 plus have that and assists and indeed. 10K so beautiful right now who has been good across the board as well you can see the CVS within 5 or every single person except jungle but I'll take to get over 310 everything Fry's but afro I bet it's time to walk away ending lever flash for nothing secure about their their spot later on in the quarterfinals in and this is really big for dick by Mandy sings just keep stacking up this early game is perfectly set up now for dignitas to fight the dragon not only do they have control over by Ed Baker Gangplank ultimate is coming back up but now whoever doesn't even have flash either
