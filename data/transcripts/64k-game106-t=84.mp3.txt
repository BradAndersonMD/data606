series that I really think Golden Gardens had a really really hot surgeon the very end of the split flyquest did have a rough and tumble off the Evil Geniuses but scum expected dates in this evening if we could catch up really quickly golden Guardians even though they're coming in at the lower seed to this match the last time around it was that week. Story of the entire weekend because he went 300 on it. Golden Guardians here so I expect that you know the Zoe as well as some of these support pics to be the focus very early on hereyeah I think it's important to watch for right now we're seeing Golden Gardens put out a fairly typical syndrome and more and more and more overtime that Sandra is being banned away very early on in the series offense against blue flag with an intelligent lie so getting rid of who he's content and FBI both played very well on Guardians as well I think those two carries got to keep your eye on generic early round pick flyquest can start with the air and they actually lock-in aatrox first pick for solo just as a versatile blind pick a little bit surprised you actually thought they were supposed to love it more towards the bottom half of the mapyeah I guess it really want school to have a good one and one match if I think in here to be honest these are few players who have played several years but finally I think to themselves on Sullivan topping to get them. Tell her I think he has been a better performing top cleaner than Viper and black racer kind of solidifying on that being there their style tickets in to be correct for them and with him on a truck to drive to play or he's got the highest First Blood rate of any Taco Bueno in the LCS until you take the aftermath of them liked or could be fully that one out out of nowhere with the first pick right now you mention for bottom line it can also be flexed Utah playwe both make the other one immune and it gives you a whole bunch of playmaking around the dragon early on into the game meanwhile flag with this diet and rakan racuchy look pretty easily. Way through any parents comes the Q Telegraph and all of that and in general I feel like there's enough ability here to survive if you want to and if you get a good engage on Calista you can win the two on two should be very exciting bottomland a lot of power on both sides I will say but what was the provides a good way to use turmeric with an ultimate so you know I feel similarly on a level of skill involved in this matchup if the blade collar on the Callisto which is difficult to Cabo you can take him down that gets a lot more difficult level six months that are can multi the Calista but sometimes you can even before that dropped Dorn shows up once again no surprise to anyone who's been watching professional League of Legends for the past two months even with the slight nurse that does Bill scale extremely well isn't is going to allow some more power into that Calista that you're talking about to get a little bit more stats by upgrading items best-performing junglers he was number to All Team voting so absolutely you stand out so far this year and I think hands-down the best player on the soft Life West through the Bandit Zoe golden blue on a budget into the very very end of the split part of that third part of that when they got in flyquest as well as campeon top-tier reflect but ends up being probably a jungle man of this case so it does mean Golden Gardens get count to pick and mid-length they have off at the Oregon top leading cause of death in the bottom line here is going to look pretty good fly fishing the jugular and then Wyclef they have had power vehicle on LeBlanc previously and he didn't do poorly on the champion per se but it did feel like the team didn't play that well around this type of Champion Power of evil as a midline player highest damage per minute of any player in the ALCS usually is on nothing's like Victor are you fixed long-range waveclear high damage output later on with long you do have to control Vision a lot you look for these pics the first higher-risk boobs but one thing that I would say I always do like seeing leblanc's pick later when they know that there's no easy point-and-click answer to that poke if you Distortion in and you know that you're going to be able to get off your combo on the Block becomes a lot easier towards the late game where people sometimes feel like she falls off because it's harder to navigate to you by looking at the school dance audience lineup he goes in for the distortion definitely green has got a huge Telegraph jobs going to be telegraphed list enteric take forever to get that to go off as well so yeah I think our people has a playground through to play with on that very elusive LeBlanc I I think as their best player I think he is well equipped to make good mousse but but you're right again to the point that the team fight promise of the one specifically is not quite a sight that said so we've been playing well I expect they got to the atrox I think adibatla you got xayah rakan that's going to have great late games Gilling as well so this took comp where though I tend to agree I did Pee-wee Is Awesome on control Mages Auntie fight Mages the cop at least supports playing LeBlanc both on their side and the opposing side this should be a fun way to watch for about to get ourselves into game is going to be really excited to see in this best-of-five who's going to strike first blood in this battle loser is playoffs will be there in summer but they're seasonal otherwise be over first team will be eliminated from playoffs here today who is it best-of-five starts off here with some pretty heavy scaling on the top half of the Guardians as well goldenglue actually as a mid laner has the highest jungle presents difference which means that he gets Camp a lot less by enemy jungler but closer does spend a lot of time 3:15 around that Midland at least enough to be within range of warding rounded laying in thank you for Golden glue so we may see that come into effect here because LeBlanc and recs I always is a pair that you expect to look for kill pressure and that is going to be something go to glue will have to deal with it's one of the players with a few of those solo death stats Stephen the case it's fun to look at ten of the historic stats of the team know that all these teams have played a full regular-season you can kind of take a strong look at how exactly they play the games out Golden Gardens going for an aggressive invade toward the bottoms how to kill suddenly Center who wanted to start red buff maybe doesn't get you using ignore and while to wait around and maybe they were engaged in the red who he spots in Turin they should expect that you will Lane in fact is FBI shows they know what the 3 on 3 right now I'm more than just the one with all the windows. We could you don't screw it we're going to present Acres Campground it's worth more gold and a camp and did not the worst thing the world but closer this video thing I see he walked by the only at 1:30 right there where did go to Bible Camp has been very good in the early game he quite frequently has gone for these types of invade stealing away first Red Bluff their bonus is purely a champ select invade for Golden Guardians they had to Stronger level one on the bottom half of the map with charging Calista tarek and so they're able to fully flyquest off of it central line start the crugs while they're taking the Red Bluff and then he transitions into a very quick Raptor Camp should be still be able to get level 3 on on his blue quadrant meanwhile closer already level three on the Jarvan will look to see what sort of early plays he can make a deal has actually won charges for standing still oh nice reflux Center and gets me through this, but it's not going to happen if you take a look at the fact that well close has extra board kill the scent when is going to momentarily be up a camp with that one going down cake was going to come and finish out on rafters to your butt and it had a pretty decent start your both sides yeah I remember not all camps are created equal as the Raptors and wolves are a lot less experienced so even though that does show there is significantly more experience in the other camps golden blue still get this black horse even though Bowser was there hovering still there cuz he sees them on the right side that says it's still has it find the bottom side and The Roots will be a pretty big hit of the day of those are both in pretty equal spots got a point out a small spot to the flyquest do over there is more gold left there's more CS for FBI task lights that shouldn't be too bad but yeah sure to the information asymmetry Centron Stood Still used for fighting back and forth to the with the early lead up here not you were talking earlier about how aggressively as a battle back and forth to Golden Garden their midliner and their to bottling players are all in the league and they are usually time for Saturday night in Fort Worth and it's still the case here and close to sender on Beltline yep and night now they're daring them to come to these minions but look out defensively ignorant tortora playing they let some of those arrangements to actually just die to the autos and don't overextend their as closer was hovering behind the golden Guardians my gold and blue walks by a ward to spot up see OK the blast plate is still alive so santorin didn't jump over the wall and take that no tunnels either so you know that Craig's the other safe for you no problem but is still have to keep my key is Flash list had to run back in a bit his boots to be available and doran's blade spin toward waiting in the wings and there are several can't stop this actually three left to clear the land but then you dive golden glue damage this is where we expect the focus and recs I are always looking for kill pressure and having flown that flash that is where the repeat King should come for so it's up to you closer to help out with some of the wards to see One controller in closest inventory right now and during the time that Valkyrie is down for Golden Globes he cannot step up to the minion wave so he have to play defensively state that asterisk Thorin does take the opportunity do after the mid lane pressure game do you know have power people pushing the waves and take the first dragon all right and thanks for having a pretty good start to your overall they got some fresh from the bottom line okay then go downstairs for a little bit but they got the pressure down there it's a good start for them over indoors is completely match with clover in farm of the top is Leading Men leading a little bit in Farm Heroes well but and the minions get kind of fresh back and forth we've got a fairly close game state where Golden Gardens are up gold from assertive random antler resource if it's right now ACF leave the bottom line is he's carrying that mostly about the dragon there is more pressure on stand for in to create action and get something done here in the early game because that's you transition sports team fights there's so much more to fight utility that you get from Jarvan especially since professional driver in 3 months of all go conquer Cinderella fairy tanky build and then you have your knock up from EQ plus you have the cat play some quick drink so much do the teen fight that's why this is one of closers most played actually is a jungler for the team of the week and pressure which a c fuse and then transition into a very useful teeth by starter and Hans are getting pulled back by The Chainsmokers. Their pits continue fighting the top light has a brand of estriol to start the match of obvious you're going to go on Orange and soft enforces the tank first without one major I certainly are on the top side I do want to point out that one of the very very worst first tell percentages in the league date historically have not prioritized as well or at least they have not won those fights that you can see why isn't a sock still going down to the Berkeley Stags are has roamed up but cannot talk to get top of that running all the way over she doesn't text with does run up on top of things like this word they got to give that one up and we'll see if and when Soul recalls as sponsors Orem comes down to bauxite but he can t be up there when needed and that I really like bringing up that sack because it's an issue
