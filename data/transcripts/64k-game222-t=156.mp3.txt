405 still talks too much about the 7-Eleven at curse kind of record in the architecture games above that prove they're looking like a legitimate Contender and very very practiced in their game against 9 EP plays as well as practice pumpkin ultimate to really get a lot of work done so I think there's so much for their fans to be happy about just like the fact that you've now curse them despite the fact that I lost earlier in the day, which gaming control their own destiny small chain slipped and fell mostly takes number one though they are on the outside looking in on that one sealed will not pick in the first picpaste piano strictly banned in the second band Faith as it gets later down but we know that the monthsurprisingly tall is Tiana the three most most place there and Cody Sun going to be on this differ here so priority over the last couple having some of that kind of used ility out of your Botley the beat up when you want it off and play very aggressively with the rest of your lineup for clutch to make them on the schedule for Cody sun is only seen outside of support role we see her Top Lane time and again we see her bottle and as the farm Champion for players like Fanatics Reckless there's a such want me for a very good as well.Planet Fitness going up to ruin it will be going to pick up the split so that would be in another Milestone beer for him he certainly has been a very flexible there I fit in quite well with y'all do you know pretty big part of their turn around this split in and why they are doing so damn well but still going pretty standard stuff you have a strong Daisy style of jungler and then I do think that you usually where you see the most out of craziness creativity from clutch is from there so lame and Tompkins is a great pic to help before that yeah definitely can be really strong can you play aggressively and my boys house looking around today do anything too crazy really against the Swanee as well it was Ben Swann Target left in tank it eat them out that go but if it is going to be bought Lane Parma, Caitlin is a very aggressiveI haven't ever really looks not harassing pushing this Duo setup your craft starting to ask someone to turn off lights in effective against the wicked release to the winds bear that was alongside of locks which are the champions box is probably exclusively a mid laner but I always a possibility sometimes games get nerfed in there than overlooked they still have some of the pranks that they would normally have but don't stay away from Demonte that's been his big Motif here is one from the band who come through for the Clutch Gaming side and and wait to see what comes in you can see the caste of an app for editing skills you did stick right side for this team besides election they wanted to be red side there so they are really waiting to make sure I'll ask him if it was good. I think it's actually really intelligent against the team that is out there like watch who is moreI have to try crazy counter Baker to try them them take her fault you know when you go red side you can actually have that last encounter pick every single game get the opportunity to be the one answering. So they don't just have really catches you off-guard to hear COC very much and want to ruin to have the final say even keep the karma make a noise like something else like when I send for him if that really comes through again spoke against all in so we can withstand the Caitlin Parma a bit more than you could last a little bit there and I still will not leave his view that you would have been already or otherwise and Elsa turn to pick up their top of the newest text champion of hereyeah we'll have to see what he does actually want to bring out you know he has been playing the thumbs UPS he's like that I need to win a game on it earlier this season so I'm bringing that out and it's looking like it you know it's good very well in a beat at Bard bot Lane leave, I'll send the top lady who can actually answer this Nico quite well known as kind of use the Millermatic too much more heavily a lot of rain. Just can't answer is just fine is not going to be The Bard unfortunately we will get strong so Caitlin and Brom will be that do oh well it's a really big meatball for two big carries the back line and they Carmen support all of it up to 20 bronze is a really really good tank setup to make sure your team fighting is good and Kate is beer has certainly doesn't they're also has the ability to actually follow up on CC fairly easily when you look at that is such want to eat son the past is done for prom as well you can still easily trap out of that on the Kaitlyn so if you are agetting caught by one of those see see if you can expect Caitlin trapped if all is well and be quite effective and we will have to see how she feels she is going to want to try to play this out and I do think I promise as about lying to me to now kind of no longer guarantee that they're going to have to put some pants can also push against is fairly effectively and usually when you see Caitlin do you want to see the bushing hours the threading in that way and I got farming evenly against Dipper I don't know if that's going to be good enough from the Caitlin so we'll have to find out I was too he was really going to go my instinct feels this is a little bit closer depends how much time between 6A can do cuz I feel they give last words and how the cops going to run with teeth look like and what blanks you should be aware of what lies you play to in Lake and we are ready to go to this one clBruce his clutch came and we are all the Rifts it'll be which team takes me on this one Comet for power of evil here a little bit more Lane Focus than lethal Tempo have a bit more pressure in a matchup like this but Demonte also going to be answering that know he is going to be going no more for it to sustain here so it's yeah that's why I should have put that bronchial and you can Flash following you probably always died so it goes down to get 10 free go to that one thankfully for clutch no extra board to be killed and I would say it was you if you overfill she'll give you find that but at the same time probably sells the flashes if then decide you want to come through I'm not sure I do think there is a chance you could have actually held the skill point levels spell shield use that on the Bronx you and then at the very least we would have to flash the flash likely but I'm not sure I quite if it said when he would have been arranged anyway yeah I think you're going to take him power karmic you regardless in that case and something's going to follow you and that might be too much do you have to win spell shield at 1 when you want to eat in W4 so I think it's fine and they're going to share 15 watch game and get a bit of money there and we'll see now what they want to do in this one as they help with that. Campus stole the chickens and I've no big issues and after all our talk about Nepali do to starting without glasses the silver means well you maybe don't get too pushy if you if you would have had that bush going on otherwise you have to play that quite carefully in this case and it is actually carry on this car my here so you'll going to war for those looking laning room we have seen a lot of klepto Karma stimuli into a magic even in some of the range math tubs just utilizing things like a nice are to walk up and actually trade with the klepto can be quite effective, but this is going to give some more Lane power and room will not actually turn on until he hasn't items are really going to get the most out of it without you for a slow does zero damage and well Lee restaurant to stock up via goats not goes for sarees I'll be worried already sweeper comes in clears away at war that was on his Red Bluff if you could either on the bottom side especially not his field trip in doubt those frogs and say hey be sure he's down there don't be too afraid of US 1 minute 40 second be final and modeling ice hockey scary down here long enough for me to get both certainly the attack speed from that Shrine that's helped out quite a lot of fire rabbit and I'm at the same time would we just clearing this up and we'll be heading up towards his is pop. Looks like it is just going to pull Camp clear here from Wiggly in actually clearing out quite quickly he's at right now that's a fast really clear General but yeah so far all looks pretty good for the steel Gees I think they got released from it helps a little bit I'm not certain I don't remember if I did see that but likely in any case that's kind of watch gaming are going to continue their mid-length send against of power field pushing in plenty of time to pick up so he's actually going to be closed or up in farm as a result if you don't have the Agro well and so far so good so we will be finished with that fix gas go back to base with you where he wants to go towards has pretty much every single said he doesn't it certainly has been if it's damn ball Frost with the push but again that could changes as things move forward as the flash does Come Back to the Future Cody said he may be feeling more comfortable to actually start should I play a little bit more graphically in and look for that bush 1 minute 40 seconds ago so count your clocks in its about 5:30 in the game he's back to full power but died before then then a he's not got all the tools he wants from self out Frost takes down a quick have it so far so good I'm both these Lanes, even though you can see you in a little bit you're forced to say and starting actually seven bit of that trap line mid lane going pretty well for Fue though he actually does for us at first base there from Demonte and as a result may be able to hold onto his own teleport actually just walk it back but weekly they're going to take both those small chickens that's supposed to go canvas little one so they're coming out ahead and go to the results of 04 still some of that money was taken away is ruined keep poking backed up his rooms and I got a pretty close top laying down there as well so pretty and really in the entire map is Boe has making a price taking his first teleport now as well as extra CR to feel pretty comfortable at the very least most of the little ones at the big one in you can Retreat now back to his side of the map where a couple of those can't that are responding where is going to be going mirror Star Theater for the jungler does they are both on the shellings might as well just started to look for dogs getting a lot more damage so far to Montana have a hard time with this one if you got some reason but it could be a second recall coming into very very early on is only $500 to spend that is not great no definitely not again GIF power people in other free read that he should be able to shove in this way and look exactly base without really losing much of anything there is there so there's potential we're trying to fold away for his mid later and instead of a breed by pantomime for the power we will stay around to grab the ocean Dragon what you going to do well for this lady with a sociology delete power for all Lenny face going to feel incredible off the how it really that came in here coz I could have the winning go up lots of fun when you get something like that because when is really does get amazing at that point towards the power of evil was feeling so so good in that matchup already in now going to be even better spot 3806 Liberty side steps to dig Boomerang play for the important part of the kit for the game and I'm going to stay alive here they just keep knocking down these minions have two waves reset UCF 3cs leave for 6:11 Dover power of evils of really meaningful difference up in that lane that's not very slight detour to nearest retail. Again stopped trying to look level six four layer of Flash's off the blue Smite around 2 is almost assuredly a kill in a room if there's not available there from Wiggly weekly ad that faster first clear and he spend his time actually taking the dragon will beer was so Farmingham still didn't get head in the experience and as a result April 4th flash season is starting to be able to figure out these days very quickly and as a result it's going to be a lot harder for 6 a.m. Christopher comes in eventually you can come out with that one one of these silver nurse that dropped her off of number one was increase Mana cost so maybe at some point you see that start to push itself through hasn't happened yet but a can of the future before this item to coming through game still very close and gold overall can let the gaming Prime position to fight for a second place spot in the regular season. Dating still balance for a playoff position to pay feel comfortable with the remaining schedule going to hope that they can at least look good here than beat their drug competition in the coming weeks are over the remaining schedule they do have guardians of hundred do you say that is a lot easier because my dude is that cleanse Tom Ken and so if you need Cody Sunday
