it was just one of the largest possible disappointments especially after all the height of after they got bang but as you mentioned once before also want to hear this point is there by 2 and 41 not in the last week of patch 9.13 + Pro play in North America still going to have a lot of enchanteur bands coming out you and me luck Carmel all could really important than I had a band that's exciting thing is actually very strong on patch 9:13 so if they saw were you practicing it in solo queue of the W mag cost is actually very low the Q was faster than it was in previous pageant that has been adjusted for 9:14 but actually understand the band there for Dan to see at least it's important band we know we're not going to play with me to pack is it but if it's not true for you look drop it off the tablede-carb and away so luck has been for mere as has been as ear and we'll see which one goes where but you can expect you this chance to come up pretty quickly and feed on first of all the other pics of wanting not only a strong Pick 4 spent Aaron since he's been around in the protein so long and it's a lot of his wanting only once you want to split but it's a big denial pick from amazing who's picked up two wins in four games on normal length of got to be a positive ones there goes with second most played in there making it his all time in the summer split the standard high priority met a champion at some point as well and they're going to get that whenever they wanted as long as they let you know that it for the band face but one that right away they are waiting to pick their just kind of picking the pipe resin Champion so farBiafra news First Watch Game of the split 100 thieves had been fairly reliant on just going for xayah rakan whenever possible since when 100 deep does find success at the office through a through making strong and gauges and part of how they bounce back is with strong Wayne faces between bang and a half of myself as a higher Gable play up to 20 pick you were expecting a railing to be one of the most of the time in pixel on side so that's why I'm being serious is going to be really for sure okay is there kind of pic I want and we'll probably to the Midland answer what I have two words 5 seconds ago Cloud I need another champion it could be support could be bothering to be Top Lane it's actually going to be obviously Charlie physical is completely set up to play the way they want to play it possible to move the irelia mid lane if they want to be able to kind of pick either one of those Lanes only works in Crevewell with melee laners particularly rally as you mention that's why they combo so well together and the whole top side of the map for C9 is so aggressive and still good early game I'm actually maybe even expecting them to try and bannout may be a corking his ear in the second phase to force more of a volatile matchup in the Middle Lane still that's been staring thing really can call Temple Shir also want to point out that some of the other pristine Midland pigs have been left off Kianna actually has escaped through the first six fans and pics pics of doing picking her up either true that has been a high pretty damp in there it is Young Lyric really would make composition sense in that regard we know it's ever watch the bottom light almost for certain I'm not expecting Lex to go in for you and there's easier band that is working as your profilewhat type of Solon if you get to pick later but I want to kind of call attention to the Lux and discover because even those are very powerful team fighting Champions they are not necessarily known for getting sandwiches in the early laning phase and looking through 100 ft stats real and fake God are mostly just there to stick around until the team fights days with some of the worst gold stats at 15 in the entire lcso hundred thieves will need to play A Little Bit Stronger in both the top and mid lane position since that's not normally where they can get their advantages so so far just based on the Tennessee two teams are really like tonight for something to get blind if he is still flexible freshness Kiev places Champion once this split works pretty well in either Lanes what is it in mind and I would be surprised even pick 3 is Champion a tank top when it's almost more sacrifice the bolts and bakeI want to kind of take the L for the team and survives the best he can in bad situations up against these arguably best top laner and Licorice and he quasi blind VA truck yeah and I'm just going to say that a truck to go on top and that's what she not to be driving around now Canon would not be too surprising to throw up toppling against the atrox add some things to go to the Rockets win for sure they kind of a definitely makes sense as you can or magic damage the roster which can be nice to see and it will certainly be laying down in it for licorice and and now we know they really is going to go mid for Nifty here Braum's going to round out the bottom Lane I like him a lot into server you block the boomerang blade you block for chicken going any further pretty good at not dying and even then like what is not crazier they will push but they will not probably kill a bronchitis and now it's about what were you pick in the mid lane guessing that he's going up against really it's very rare that you would see Ken and so far he's mainly played those control me to drive to record games and is your game to Victor game not all things are available what is available though lissandra lissandra comes around and it seemed that way back in the day as well but I'm pretty sure this is a line up Sophia this will help know if I somewhat think it is amazing to me is is this team's having very diametrically opposed shrink benign have a bastardly strong numbers Top Gun gold mid-thigh for the getting out of it there benefits and their body weight has been doing very poorly in early Landing yeah I'm very much expecting C9 to try and run over the top and mid side the map the bottom Lane is the very interesting part and why it is I think a little is a stylistic mismatch between the two teams because we're not necessarily win through the bottom line they've gone equal or slightly ahead for the bottom line and then they went through the middle so it's really about whether or not 9:10 roll the early part of this game and how well the Northeast to hold onto maybe then try and force mid length in fights with lysandra mentioned earlier in the day are undefeated with leaves at 15 it's just the sample size of 2 of 2 it leaves at 15 but what happens what happens it's been very successful so last remarks from the coaches I believe we are dodging briefly and is not loading just yet I did not see what happened but someone opted out I'll hear what that is exactly in a in a little bit and we'll will pass it on to you, but we're making chapstick little bit I guess me some time to talk about lesandro because if you do cast your mind back to early on the season will solder was basically picture banned in every game and in my little you know 7 months vacation to the ballast E minor. What you did your boy learned the first one was an attempt to Nerf her waveclear by increasing hermana cost so the Kumon cost went up and basically what that did it shifted lissandra build some watch Wars luden's Echo instead of protobelt however this is the tricky thing about Mana cost is pro players are incredibly good at managing their mother if they really wanted to do they still could get jobs when he needs you to hold on Vermont of the first did they get the shop to go to Scuttle crab fight they win they have all the early CC affects the endless on whatever get what ended up actually nerfing Cassandra out of Base to 100% territory was just hard restrictions on the Q cooldown still 10-second cool down a rank one for second cool down at Max rank which is up on both accounts and it basically makes impossible for the Sandra Crouch of incredibly early and then later her way clear still reduce know she still has basically the same strong engaged and still very strong team fighting if you can get that point but the early game is much weaker so previously the Saundra was picked because irelia is still mobile basandra could shove a rally in Lysander could see see irelia in team fights and you'd win that way but in this matchup now with the current lysandra expect Misty to have a little bit more Freedom Early exactly what she and I wants ya but if 100 use can get to the late game demo sonder will still be good at keeping irelia a little mustache Valentino's the champions of this is probably even farther ago at this point that the devil and reduce magic damage either so if you locked in a really are you are all magic damage or taint that does not have really good innate magic damage durability I actually drove into base that's a bunch before irelia has high armor and low health for a champion of her class so she's actually a typically weak to Magic damage on a base that level as well to smaller margins in like you're cool then changes were but this is actually poised to be in Peabody scenarios do buffalos on intentional to preference irelia a little bit towards Top Lane even though she has so many other attributes that make her strong midlane like the E being incredibly long-range to get engages we're going way down to your belly rabbit hole with hopefully we haven't lost some of the audience but it was just kind of fun to talk about irelia lissandra matchup we will be loading into the game shortly and I guess it does give us a time this interesting facts it in this game fanfic Euler to go to get a lot more time to do than talk to other players about one of the PCL 10 champions how do you want to approach the game this is this is kind of a rarity I suppose but the extended from the coaches on stage really true and I wonder what they'd necessarily we talkin about now because normally you as you mention can I have 20 seconds to say oh yeah by the way watch out for the driving game top or watch out for says Yankee top at 3:20 because you've done a lot of scouting and trying to pick out players early-game tendencies in this I wonder if you just remind people like hey by the way sneaky you're probably going to get ganked a lot because that happened every game text looking to the Jungle proximity difference which is the percentage of time you're younger fans near you vs. when the enemy jungler spending are you sneaking Azazel or have some of the most negative JP differentials in the entire game they are basically left alone while Spence Karen goes around and thanks for nisky for most of the game and then licorice actually ends up not getting ganked that much because the enemy truck is making sticky play weak side of the map but as we've seen from Spencer Terence a SanDisk East Side Liquor to Steph was a pressure top side is working as much as it is to be you know to V4 in the bottling for the C9 Duo the 3-v to Top Lane goes really well also and of course he not alone and stuck in this is clearly a strategy that has working for them even it does make sneaky and they look a little bit bad on the other side of the map of course hundred thieves it's really kind of diving into had a few stats cuz in my mind I always just like ignore the first four games cuz that was before they put the roof it got switch in the meeting were still in those games by playing a lot of an order play with a hundred things are as an aura kind of the same but to me like I'm mentally going to start them in week 3 what does 04 deficit hey that's already got to make that a lot better but from that point on if they've been a bit more promising of an amazing first game of the stage he landed earlier in the morning out of Germany and it had to play on stage and he would sleep deprived in his game play yeah and speaking of amazing I do feel like the pic they have been gravitating towards have been fairly successful is the coaches we're going to be able to have the authority Jarvan to Kewanee tank control junges for amazing that the type of stuff he was playing when he had his Resurgence over in I think was the EU LCS the time now LEC right if I'm getting my timeline drive for amazing but it is a type of game he's comfortable with as long as I don't get 400hp player only an LEC coach EU LCS player which is a rarity but we are now on this game between Cloud9 and hundred bees out of there if we are and let's see what we can do see 9 and 2nd hundred you just a game out of playoffs with only six games left to play with ground to make up a tough opponent for them today yeah can't wait to see where the attention is spent early on in this game how well can fake God hold up against licorice I know before we got the roster submissions we were wondering whether or not they God was going to be going up against Cuomo and what you have the battle of the rookies in right how is it going to work because T9 place so well around can you actually take down fake God now we have to see how Rusty licorice is going to be because he really did take time off to rest you play one Academy game to make sure he was not Rusty play they dropped one with C9 Academy Now look up against any trucks in Raleigh thanks guys probably super tough opponent in Cloud 9 today what was the main focus for this week's preparation and how confident is the team come into the match this week a big part was like kind of groin or Champion pools I think a C9 is a tough opponent specifically because they have really big pools so that was kind of a big message that we're trying to push across this week so we're playing a couple of new Champions this weekend so I'm kind of sad about that Mike was on her maybe affect you guys Christian and even one of the other ones as well and we never get to see it cuz Cloud9 scumbags Bandit away even though it's not necessarily new DLC First Time pics
