we're diving the Champions like the first band to the table so we're going to send it back over to freaking us out for game to thank you very much freaking Avail is right there I am freaked and we have a 540 record up for us here somehow I knew you were going to do that as well and maybe I can fight or flight from South Orange is bad so the most obvious respect is not around but that is often very good chance that definitely is very very strong is going to be set for a second look like and I forwarded it could be popping out of traffic but I hear it so hotBeatles first draft stand or not I'm not certain what do not be surprised if the first Pixar the good actually very very reliable pick up all the same and so yeah we can kind of talk about what's happened with these teams I actually am very intrigued by this. That that was what brought a piano app that switches that Immortal spends more time behind than ahead I got the record of Silent for there a winning team they are tied for third baseman more time behind ahead they have a negative gold difference over the league right now like the overall at their phones game more gold than they have but they have they have lost a really intelligent veterans on the team who have been able to figure out ways to win games from difficult situations and sometimes it also can be kind of a compelling Point as well because one thing that I think has a bad job if you don't look at like more context is if you win quickly and Lou slowly you like yes we got ahead and then we close the game out in 22 minutes we're really with a decisive and if we lose a minute we make you fight for it like we fight tooth-and-nail we won't fall over or so good either side of my back while you were behind for 35 minutes and you're only had four eight arguably were actually get right inside like yeah I'm not sure that's a little behind but they're finding wins mckaley fairly quickly when they are I think the only kind of argument against haven't had a lot of most of the Winds and people that I immediately think of the DLC gameplay they're losing the whole game they lose it the soul than they bought this back door right and what should have been an enormous lyrics where they pull off this one big fight with a little turn things around and make something happening and that does deserve credit right that is a skill in and of itself being able to kind of manipulate your way out of these difficult situations and and find ways to it of course they are coming off a two-game lost streak right here on the immortal side they had recently gotten four in a row which was good at kind of kind of like the top of the standings and so I am very curious I think almost exactly how high do all this team stack up when it when the records are so close together it is very hard to tell like definitively who is who is actually better than than whom and right now it has a lot of good and worth mentioning that 10 wins has never missed playoffs in alsea is not a mathematical walk 459 but if they win today history would suggest there in playoffs and I don't think that's going to be a big star branding one it is kind of cool to know you're not that far into the playoffs would be pretty insane where a lot of the time there's such as Shuffle you want to drop off quite a bit but they are still on for this is actually the been a 18 Nerf patch what are the things that I really want to because you're getting a lot less goals 23 one more light on heels on trading on these type of things you actually get to the same level that you had before in the ALCS my feeling and Bentley what I observed is that they were just left Brady and way less fighting compared to eat Missoula few of these types of things so I'm expecting send it to be hit much more heavily in Pro play where it is at fensive then it was in so that's why I wasn't expecting to see Santa as an easy as a turnabout Lane Marksman write my was executive order support is anything still will be in to see how to 40% a little bit of a more hybrids play style I would do Academy played tennis started as kind of the support for a while in pain like partially shared Farm in the galley of player was kind of going a half way and we've seen a different game works and it was the hardest before it was paired with a farming or that you're still the damage was coming from Spain. But she was like harassment telling to see how the concepts of the tomten farm here we have to leave for the Tomkins is the farmer that you're the game I don't expect that to be the case to Standard Market support stuff as the mid lane as well obviously that is on the table but I do think you're fairly good match of just that it is something we're right it's not that bad of yours going to dominate you but I think vitamin was going to stop for the same reasons I think Kayla Kathy Wendy's Champions are good and that's because if you free to formally where's that cannot punish you widen your Casio KL Champions are just worth more later in the game but I do believe it is one of those matchups but with me at least getting locked in alongside that there is more of an opportunity to try to attack the Vladimir early at the bottom are left in you would expect to lose any sort of Scooby-Doo that it's like even late up on that top side so the pressure I think so as already and on a committee to put licorice down in the early stages otherwise they're going to feel the wrath of Vladimir later on and they're still the one percent chance to meet up lad still goes to mid-length I got to be respectful of that pencil for life of wine piggish midliner but should feel comfortable against the glass and I'm going to be first plane that was different and so he will answer here in bed have a lot of blonde braids damage but it will hit the floor Jelena or this diet or whatever so it is going for a flight Flight Support more reliable on the side of a mortal definitely when you have that work on that is kind of your go button link up with your Jana Immortals Tom speak very have lead to wanting to see if I Do by B5 to find that engage jump on it, like that's gonna take him down for the Zoey tur pick them off I do think cloud 9 is going to have to be a bit more creative about their engages try to find opportunity for they can for somewhere else to fight them poking out with Joey and then looking for follow up on that boat with a getting engaged or flank them from you resend Vladimir these types of the stories we also have to always remember that you can play freestyling with Vladimir especially when paired how long is Dennis the Comcast you get an eighth for a difficult situation that's been all 10 from the time and I'll do rotations coming through from the top Consulting turning one you want into a 3D one may be taking down that sets Queen the game to fix games now on Leesville across 10 game time start for cloud nine these everyone's favorite for best jungler in the LCS right now for us with a lot of waiting Lanes a lot of skilled players not much of a surprise to have that happen but honestly Cloud9 been rewarded with the opposite of the best mechanical place I've seen in the LCS ever and he has really pulled off some special stuff and is shining truly in his first full-time starter as it as if I'm not here to see him growing the first team to stop the Cloud 9 season if you want to let you know that could do it I think they have gotten a lot of artifact results so far I think they can be very creative. So as talked about music for Who need another creative player I think I need some people are attracted to be very good here for a mortal sin that goes come through if by some kind of his decline of play the real quick though got Gabby said about 3 thank you so much free I just wanted to get some words from you before we head into this game first of all 900 going into the second half of the regular portion is there anything different in your approach once that happens I'm not real that's what I figured as much because a lot of the pics that you're coming through are very similar to the first half one different thing I want to know is Vladimir so how do you feel that he's going to be able to do in the Top Line especially if there is a focus from the other team probably the Chris gets pushed in 24/7 and skis getting out later team. He was crushing everything but I'm probably rough for him so yeah we'll see him fighting that Immortals are definitely going to try and insist upon here I don't think you did to us all right well that's words from Reaper let's head back in the game I had are awesome fast to check stuff out for me the first player to play a champion six times this flip me is the most recent one trick of any player but scroggin and I actually probably more pics to re-fix on their mostly chance they can't I take anti for the six acts but one of my library is very much about plainly spent and had to put a water I think he also does have a lot of other Champions that he can bring it to the next one appropriate but hey at least in very strong the matter right now they loved hearing it alongside the AP till later and is that your some of that Insight from RI. It's pretty much larger back in and I was talking about with Vladimir hey you just tomorrow and out Daly look at more done later on we'll have to track thing with and that really do you know Bronco identity Sandcastle is on the legacies CW Auto in there as well pick that one up and we'll keep the track going over the course of time to fight Lane is being pushing and I want to point out by the way that it's Tom Kent store in Spring it's been going for the sickle-cell you know it is very harassed Baisden and it's been trying to stack up letting both get the mine and I actually really like that's right because I do think that you need to make these adjustments you just won't have souls intro play if all you're doing is one you need to be harassing so then going for the sickle really cool adjustment they're going to be stacking that up by harassing me to be stacking up your souls from brassing around the time that you have to complete that support item I am assuming he's gonna start picking up way more of the farm lipstick on a scale there this is going to make Vulcan much more of a true tank in that front line cancel for A to B to going on here around Midland Smithy driving around all right if they could you look up a fish be stolen Sumner there so was he able to use to kill. Not much worse aircraft another heel for himself now since he do patents that stops it is going to be spotted out in this tribe but there is potential for some sort of a place is beyond cruggs now and is aware of where it's nippy is thanks to that wore that we are seeing rate down at the bottom of your right there beside the golden buzzer medium frog will not force the deepest part of the camp so just be a very minor amount of gold the next be available to apply for fever walked up there I think that he's known to be around to see if licorice can like see him at this point he's and didn't rain so we got to fight the bottom sides nice shop for Vulcan in that goes over this is really funny what is a way to actually see them continue to play this dick that is so good for that yeah oh wow you know kind of dressing to the changes that were made in the little reminiscent of kind of like Persona Terror type stuff that we had seen the past where you're putting a lot of farming support release get them very strong obviously they can't do the double to four items because they'll actually be no cut off and look at this. Minute we're giving my 2 month olds in the farm though your Vulcan will be way behind on the bicycle that is something that is going to come out and I'm not even sure if woken is going to feel the sights on this evening to call for the back now you got to be here as well and it cocoon goes on to spend on his trunk by book a ticket for this done all the time or they're always right the safety so pretty easy walkway to see nice to be able to back it up just good positioning I think from the two voltages trying to have it at war that sleep was really post on Oslo who could have been in trouble if that did Landon up here on this job site again it This Is War trading but especially with phase rush you can beat down the flat Amir a bit but he can actually keep his distance steel back up with a concentration fusions and really just play this earlier events it because that's why I'm here as long as you're farming okay and you're staying alive if you're getting more than just a standard pick up which is doran's ring even if you don't need the memories and it's still gold efficient ability power and I really really want so I'm going to see a lot more than over time and same thing for Holly as well it's just one of those things is also really nice about that lobe 888 me fairly hard actually know last hit sometimes on this Champion having the door into the extra damage on that is going to make it easier to last hit five day passes on basement back to those who just bought an item makes your life easier so as to shopping in The First Tee Pee is burning and licorice has the first price that you really care about the armed guard is in making play Tanki and now we're putting out he's only fighting visible damage from so I don't like to buy I think it's I think it's a little bit weird when you're building new HP and you're going to be against the least you can come in on Monday yes it is very effective is your only against that sat in stomach killing their cvrs is very effective boat in the one you want to go
