Team Liquid won yesterday through their bottom Lane in a begin to pick some bands will see what's front of these teams have for US optic tied for first team liquid just a game behind Lux actually getting bad before you even now there's so many supports and bottom line is there Premier band at the moment the Lux but you may also the stone at Eric has to be broken up Sophia of cancel a check is taken up by Perma bot Lane Focus bands at the moment we would have banned UT and 100% of their game for today does not play and they are afraid of it they are not willing to put it into drive or blue or red size though. Just threw the game state that they are in is optic now drop rise offyeah I know I'm always reluctant to make the jump yes they don't want it Nancy I said they don't want to First Pickett will see hear what they fall out with Ryan as you know on live it got a little bit of a rework one of his many but apparently still on 911 also extremely powerful right up there with the stylist in the atrox and a chart soon to follow so I'm guessing Silas does get taken off and they don't want to let it through is the possible trade off for first pick for Optics I think that will be a team liquid fan so Optics will be going into it may be a real vs. optic actually three and one on red side at all the games they're banning Silas in the Bluetooth off in the first picture I think we'll do it to look at wants to leave after this oneand we will wait to see you and it is going to be outside with that is the only across at least summer split so far the top five regions I love that so foolish child Stout Alabama with the quick to go for though there's a lot of the people in immediately jumped you however are optic going to stick with their tank top strategy right in the more simplistic set up to the T fight I think something that has been a big benefit of that style has been Arrow Arrow from the bottomlands been doing so much damage consistently in the Deep bite for the majority of their wins at least I know has a lot of silver games which is extremely strong right now and benefits greatly from having no not only the jungle cake and Bonnie but also something else for them to have on the front line for see if they follow this when UPS is why he also works super well with a Collie and Aralia you know if you get those melee assassin to stack up is done soalso possibilities here is very strong dual-income through 14 liquids II plus Ricotta's very very great bottom Lane is the Sona and Luxe fans were aimed at them but not those are quite a j on his actually signature pick he's got his own skin and BB guns I hear as well he's a Champion by far stiffer is left up that's expected pick up here for everybody that comes through not only does he have the skin but he has the signature on the loading screen for the champion is well literally so you guys are other parents if they had wanted to go with a Caitlin again and go you know Morgan or something like that and try and seeds in foot No Pain by binding to the traps as well as no rotate that our house around for the auto turrets but they're going once again for the Derek I'm already recorded as the rear akkad game who is named the first one is a little bit Rocky but followBarry Goodwin yeah the split-second initiations I think Dallas is pretty much the go to answer to work on right now it's just more Tankian Lane has a easy time of trying to stop her car with the task of Auto tax play FDT in the kit try and deal with that and there's the irelia that we also talked about already setting up it's my favorite parents with cyclonic it's absolutely insane irelia can start st. Boni Falls it up with so many stuns you can in the hundred percent is 0 most champion at level six there's very few options for getting out of that sun Lok with those two combining lacrosse Champions and that gets pretty difficult to deal with stock up. Getting locked in here which I think is actually very a pat on the champion getting bit more popular overall but it gets to Aftershock users here in the Nautilus Anna said Vonnie very easy old targets to become aan absolute evaporate those tanks went that keeps on false plug-and-play couches that to says whiny Expedia the play the champion for years I think is the best trundle that we have in the LCS he always will hold the tiller until the right opportunity off the times you can gain control go by just running at someone on Frozen Ground getting the Flash and then pillar a game where they flash do to try and get the follow up there if we would have tried to do top or mid lane bands going to focus pretty quick here though with the LeBlanc once again taken off and it is time to look at this draft right now because optic gaming are very physical heavy we could see your other go top or mid that still kind of open-ended so I maybe it's the Mage prefer, Davidson age for dhokla and Team Liquid say okay you know what they do is what position is going to help us be really a Top Lane to make brown play amazedAC to somebody else so I won't have to worry about that this time around is going to be the follow up here for optic though not going to let you if you want to pawn the car Hubbard broken down yesterday in optic hands but either way that will be the half blind pick right there as you know where they can go to either Lane but that's almost certainly not going to be in packs and we will get counterfeit fridge at the end of it all must Block in the other lane and their last solo and asriel it's going to be a you don't need to help me too much Champion but I don't have no bottles can punish I guess I could survive but I feel like it's right here again without looking for JJ yeah I definitely think earlier I like the hover over with the other option right 13thGuide to the coin Draven is the Xtreme Acro one that you're talking about trying to go for the Punisher on rakan and that's where you utilize Nautilus is DC take the fight to him popping after shocking Craven dealing large amounts of Auto attack damage but said she was the safer route looks like optic opting for Stacy and I think that's appropriate given that they have this Aurelius edwanna combination I always want to see irelia instead says whiny use for early on in the game so I think your jungle pressure is not always going to be around bottom you might need a little bit of inherent safety in Lane they're actually do that they've been kind of known for giving dhokla matchups that beg for Gangster win in the gangstas don't come so I do want to see optic actually spend their time up there with the Okla turn around the map of Australia vs. Gangplank impact had to read that are others probably Top Lane Pig games Lincoln really Champions tends to be a pretty good matchup overall and and it's one that is a bowl of phois what is best Champion that absorbing pressure is Gangplank he survives so many dive so many to be one even 3v ones at times so it's kind of a test of both player Frank there we'll see we'll see call from optic actually go up to try those Dives on him back many have tried and failed to task Global ultimate Farms up with the extra money and become so later game Power House with the barrel chain and what thing I am interested in seeing play out as well as how often lays around Midland with crown on azir he has been their best player by far they have played around him a lot and it's pushing has been a lot of the reason they have won their games earlier is here though not typically a flipbook you can hit first but it's not the same as much as bait or Anna Collier something like this for you really make some Headway in this by Ed Lane so if they can play itgreat but I wanted to be black to Pilot that yeah it's deer very much that scaling team by AV Campion from the back Spearfish homes for rent in here and if off the can get back on track currently standing at 4 and would tide in that four way tie for first but up top of the LCS if they win meant they can reclaim the Throne all by themselves optic undefeated start DLC time to take it if Champion agency liquid the hard part of scheduled ahead of them and this is where you really start to see our office is actually good or was it just strength of schedule like a quad of the games has been decent I think they can win this one and then decide to look at you like they have shaped up as well their game yesterday was really committed to me I'm taking down optic means they inch closer and closer to that first place spot and it seems like these strengths in the early game for Team Liquid are located on the bottom half of the map and these drinks for off dick in the possible moves would be on the top half so we'll see if it is a split map or if you try and show up your weaknesses rather than playing off your strength personally I'm much bigger fan of teams tried to play off their bigger strength and having their weak sides just play as safe as possible and try and avoid giving up much but sometimes we will try and go for that defense make sure it happens how to give details 454 Care Optical Genji Center icon eyeshadow to Crown & Decor to Jay's old team in the game again this is the Invictus gaming rakan so you know what are the things is fun memories little Squad upgrade to the new phone from Apple to Android you know like you're going all the way across the aisle I'm going to go with Invictus gaming is Android version so if you know what I don't know what that means but sure I'm on your side with some Toby and he probably has mostly Champion Pro play all-time 3 so if you played that long or Ian has been one of the milinkovic says most often been in the meta while not working he doesn't get a lot of bands usually has it always been Opie but has always been viable so I ate a lot but yeah he throws Ariana as the sort of town if you could say to a good team Fighters well has Farragut set up for a Sia and a gangplank you just ripped through the rest of the squad as Crown is going to put that first Reservoir. He is going to miss that first drink at Fall Out Boy the media is just fine to make that a state as the jungle lyrics on both sides. They're from Big you can see the effectiveness of that after shots to taking effect another one that damn is going to court first thing has learned the shield. The flow just yet three and that's what quite a lot of damage down if you don't check through this potion by the red glow so a little bit of extra damage they do the punishment in main phase meanwhile we had such an interesting little life Journey Through the Jungle here to commit suicide a cat camp at yellow crabs impact on the Gangplank was able to push up he comes down allows xmithie not only to get the scuttlebutt also invade for the Grump and deny videos anymore sources of experience stomach Smithy is hatching awarded Okla put down that could be they're going for it to not look at the sun just yet with the tiller available to me. That was nice to Avail training packet to damage across second of two V1 opportunity even if your teammate is close by I can really mean the difference in those jewels on the top side so good A little movement they're able to get it out in time we don't quite see any blood drawing yet taken stock of the rest of the lanes we can see big walking around getting some more control of course they doing similar stuff and then back to the Rhone Lane Spot Lane close in farm but at least double lift has been pretty close to equal Top Lane is very much impact Advantage enough boards be FM the wave has I do believe but now me to throw away but now that was pretty lashes the way they block a lot of the damage videos of crab do you was already going to pass Townsend way not a lot of time wasted for him and going for that game and it was very effective getting a flash off of double lift even though it cost big The Flash to start it all off a nautilus is very happy trading those because then you can continue to fish for hooks later on and he still has the ignitor available for the all-in quick War forts made it helped make sure you can track if the Drake goes down at some point in the early game at 5 minutes is Frost early and often to look for 1st Recon teleport comes through from SS grabs his pickaxe for Arrow arguably bit more power right now maybe that means about a nickel a better for us to Canada before toppling stilt NCS different mid laners resetting right now is brown is starting his recall Pancho Villa's magenta. Which issues though pretty tight everywhere but top is what the ultimate look is in fact Gangplank definitely one of his most comfortable Champions farming up a storm on that backside got his own Chantix 50 shows bottom to plants to plant with figs and knockout
