simple treats in seven games has been unique Champion AJ has in 17 these are of course two incredibly strong right now and TSM are fighting for a playoff bye with Cloud 9 win just lapped up as those people that fight for the last playoff by Team Liquid have already locked first on face Stellar second-half the split right back you'll 14 liquid right now for this team because DSM I've done a lot of experimenting and testing different Champions especially Purex pain while you're trying to adapt very quickly and they have a lot of a lot in their Arsenal for Champion Select 14 liquid since they're already locked first place I don't think they are the ones that need to show anything that they maywant to stay before playoffs so to me champ select he's even going to continue the analogy that the test was talking about where Team Liquid just want to stay sturdy stay strong and show what they've already sound previously in the split not getting anything away and trying to feed TSM that way where is TSM might be more willing especially on red side to reach further into those variations of champion that they have shown already in this with try and come up with a win here forthwith high with Cloud 9 and get themselves at 5 already tactical forgot to go on Ashlan and I have to take this means a lot but is there the new Patrick laughter just 10.16 it has pull up here and nurse things like this like a shake-up at 10:16 I think like thatif your c336 you're going to eventually pay steam liquid but you have to show up after 5 to show what your draft parody is what your playstyle is on 1060 n t l could watch shouldn't they are we don't think you have a good handle will tell you first round that thinks or a second router that feels really good for us that luxury of getting to watch Cloudy and the extra point is a really really really good 90th and Flagler they can all be each other it's not like to make sure that you're ready to go against your like the opponents here and so must win to have a chance at that play at 5 by time rain cloud 9 now going back to the game itself btsm Atmore Dr rezai Rec on locked into face after the bottom Lane against Bush that's all the reasons I'm so excited I've been looking forward to this game all week longI do think that this is going to be a Guess m answer of jungle here so you don't have to show your mid laners or your top cleaner yet there you go you just get the jungle answers speaker has had some of the best games honestly on Glisan even though a lot of people are critical at the scaling for lease in in the plays that you have to pull up later you already are showing tonight work on with rutan's play making Gleason and rakan are the most mobile Champs in the game and allow you for a lot of mid-game jungle support plays trying to set up the rest of your wieners so now they can focus their band on the on the topside or I would honestly even try and protect middle little bit since the attempt of the ones they're going to have to pick first and and blind one of their Lanesyeah and as the kind of end of what has come into you have done a better job of being able to carry through Broken Blade he's been having better gain to be dropped from a little bit more on red sign be so often sees how it feels like blind man is often able to nullify and go close enough Champions like Oriana can work out pretty well soon as you can see the blind it's okay like a peacock. So yeah we'll see if they will play to go to the way around impact very likely to play a safe tank tops tight end and that's also the reason why I can look it up and away safe for Mid laners blind mid laners if you're too had an amazing would walk game with the Yumi attached to him make a very good case for his MVP status so I expect another band at a blind Apple mid laner like you kind of went over you know either the Oriana or the Zoe to pretty good options for piercing it ends up being the galley elephant Woodrownot have the global to deal with the team play and that doesn't leave open the shame you're talking about for impact but I very much doubt that steam liquid watching blind pick the shed and assuming here and pick them up later for Purex scent and save their counter pick for broken played who has been so willing to take Hill Lane in the top side and it was going to be Zoe does come through you mention to say if blind. Give me the pick up we'll see what Tia wants to do for themselves even though Shanda's you know I mean really every time the game has counter picks I still think that has one of the safe ones to go for overall of course he then tells a jungle top the guanica the control over what are TL going for who is the answer to do in the middle and who's going top Oriana not a surprise to your dressing back on control MagesNano case endurance Edge through all that makes sense if ever you want to go forth and now what's going to pop in for impact our way more than okay yeah you know whichever control Mage I don't really care but we're to get Sam Sentra is a really good counter to work on upwork on and gauges and 100% of the Euro heater orkon or often times we send to Hatfield offensively so if they stick Jensen here with this injury duty if they're able to get him through the early game without getting a lot of interference from the record from the least you get to the point at Sindra where you can easily one combo either of those engaged choices for TSM your scan of the week is just so good vs work on it requires very good timing and very good you know vision and scouting but that is what we're going to get the scent does indeed come in no surprise there for enact on the topand broken play dancers with the plank to me the champion is tuition and fee Reddit Lee but I have been very critical of Broken Blade specific Gangplank play I feel it a lot of criticism from other pro top laners about his ability to actually carry later on into the stages of the game with gameplay can put out as much damage as other Gangplank players so I'm going to keep my eye on him see you when I can do this game if he can prove them wrong so far this split on his feeding carried a performance forward to use him against fighting for a playoff bye with a win there a tiebreak cloud 9 at the end of the day with a lost they sit and wait and they can fall 2/4 is flyquest beat of Mortals their fate is out of their hands DSM between 2 and 4 to be decided up just this in the next game that is what they do keep in mind for splatfest ketchup to anymore scene and we got that win but that was in the running earlyrunning today and that's going to be the other Stakes for the future game so he isn't fighting without spot see all this point it is tuna we know they are getting first seed we know this kid is on a pack of their specific spot in the standing in the first round of playoffs either because they have the buy they're going to wait and watch for who the better teams are in the other bracket regardless but how good can see I looked in their last game on his pack their last game go to the season the best burger TL as an orchid ever gotten in the LCS and after a catastrophic leave bad spring split turn it around with tactical joining the roster Brock's it being here full time so I guess we care Taco Plainfield tiny play the few games last split the head coach TL have turned a bad thing to put around back to their winning form of 2018 and 2019 yeah I mean it is a tune-up game for give me a quick but also and I think even more so it is a grudge match here doublelift did not leave Team Liquid on the best of terms despite bowside saying oh yeah your Mutual we both decide this is probably better for both and it's not just one side of the bottom Lane that has been traded here this is a very incestuous bodyblade Optical used to laid with treats on TSM Academy as well so both support Blair's trading both 80 karrie Partners over to the other side and both of them looking to prove that they are the better bottom Lane. There is so much ego in this bottom of a matchup for both sides both of them have been very active on social media even though they are friendly about it and on cordial terms I love to see matches with extra space Stakes attached to them as far as the trash-talking goes another 120 19th bring together and now they're doing battle here to the one I do want to get credit I know one meme we get from the internet as the fight back and forth actually could fly Corps did they even a great job down theredepression machine going to pick up players they don't last very long to go to the for elite treats girls at the first really sort of homegrown TSM Talent where he played on a cabin for them for over two years. Fraud up but he's actually really good part of the teeth of a surgeon has been preached coming back in on the roster you know replacing biofrost and he's got like one Death Star like he's going to really really really well for the squad as part of the second-place definitely true he has that died in the last 5 so we'll see if Team Liquid can deliver him his a first-person quite a while on the top side Broken Blade starting out doing really well with the pink match up to charge up your grasp on the minions very easily and just keep on shooting them said of course worth mentioning that he did get the extra 20 hp added to the shield passive and he's trying to spend that it helps you out a little bit in this matchup as you can see you still take a BeatI'm Broken Blade not hesitating to continue to product grass been burning all of his man up for that harassment and pushing the wave of that match up by the way is the energy burst Mana pool where fireworks Midland cuz it should be fine until a piercing slowed makes a lot easier glp drowsy if you don't want to take the running man in front of fan fuse on Chene and shouldn't really wants to get you know it's as much longer Shield cooldown up for each of those bar lights and playing around that could be important impact walking but he can't broken manifold decent as he recalled that's why the strategy for the slam for the game playing is to push the way while you're doing it so basically she could spend all your mad at you go super heavy harassed you shoot them on cooldown fucking every grass that you can every 4 seconds harass him as hard as you can and push the wave and then you recall and you refill your corrupting potion that's exactly what broken plate did he's been playing the beginning of this match up really wellroxa taking Crux is able to get a trial by fire from the executed here but broken but you see through all of his breath in potion charges for the extra man of harassing pushing the wave and then once you push the wave like that you get your recall off the refill it and buying a call now if you continue trying to farm to farm and you ran out scale this mess for later impact costly better at time of the auto attack probably in the air so gets the barrel. Down each time well done to him tactfully got the mechanics still on so many years after his world championship victory in 2013 he still got it as we all know he's one of the very best players in this league one of the best top laners and definitely Mainstay on the TL side one of the trophies whose name of course he isn't getting the shove down to the bottom side Warhammer for deadlift if I have my gold estimations correct treats can easily block the hook and that's really nice back to the time just tight enough that they get to go back anywayare the top five to looks like broken blood was unable to pick up the all of those CS it's a really good NCS leave for himself with a couple of extra being traded now but really nicely done for the last didn't you mention the fact that can practice getting off timing the better on the barrel but also his last hitting has been better during a trade and broke a plate at lost a few in his aggressive push that he tried to pull up since you're packed is going no obviously with the grass with Missy only Top Lane Keystone if you're ever going to take the champion on you got a lot of the extra sustained in the tree he is coming out of it with the extra cold now what they want to point out is at least as far as he was concerned Jen wins more games today in the match of heads up more successful over the course of a game of League of Legends Lane but could mean that you know has overall more impact right now and you sing with with the shantywith the dogs and also blocking parlays I got a decent of tools to to deal with the annoyance of direct shot parlay are some of the damage output there and you saw some pieces of it as he keep his back to lay me in and now we can play right now on there wasn't any set up their range 4432 so but not a huge cost that he was probably going to teleport right back to Lane treats a little bit bar out in the river but he has plenty of Mobility on the championthey shot their buy beer something to get something for the chance of going to fight over towards death and will still kill it he's still flying over there small CS leave here on the Sims Road North York and add to slime thick is Champion let's see liquid now to the counselor on the bottom side with that push coming through capsule on the earliest a lot of power to act was really move to be focused and finish out the way you can come back around the written test for this one now speaker is he or swiping to come through as well he'll chemistry to court JJ Team Liquid into the bed of the first battle this game they want to use
