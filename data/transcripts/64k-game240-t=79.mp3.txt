find they are back onto their Playoff lineup the same 5-minute last time around but a one-in-four start is not great yeah I have to say I like but also a couple of wacky's plays in the Deep play aspect especially didn't have a really good ones we want our guys but they still need to do both teams with the subs not successful on Day One Pizza swallowed a number to hear free to head off the table Sona off the table little change for Megabucks Banning away the diaphragm bang and has been one of his most played Champions and a little bit of comfort taken away they want to push that bottom line a little bit more and see what else you gotand wait if you would just come out at the end of it all as I've got one funnel band of push through let's see is it going to be another bottom line Focus fan like the Luxor shiver or something like that we seen being used or is it going to be one of these style fries you'll break the effects pictoa waiter halfway human or are a loss of Champions open near as bad there going to be a Missy just a little bit. To put a trundle fan up against amazing here and find a party jungle out here for it right there probably trying to protect us and you know it says wani a nautilus perhaps some sort of deftly mean they're looking to run front-to-back Steam pipe is that a struggle as big as strength is cracking those types of TNT Fireworks vilest highly prized most prized champion in Pro play this year immediately he said one of them is taken out the table and you been with a trundle to grab their own big take if I want to really get here as well and it has ended up wanting irelia over the akali all right brake for people watching the first game I want to sound like a broken record okay Swati irelia together in the early game for all the reasons he said it's how they work so well off each other sitting up each other's Sons you can get a hundred percent unlock there so we'll see if amazing and fake God is able to bring it together those are two of the members that have been put on the team to turn 100 thieves bees in around I hope they can start it soon they are already ate half of the way through the first round robin and it says 0 and 5 start not a good Mark is how this season has been going first one they have the longest recorded a lost streak in LDS history that's a bad start for that has been a very rough on the roster also they spent about three quarters of every game significantly behind is basically a a freak point where it's a major test it is been a rough start run a fever go to the very best of turn that one back around hoping that they can find their way in and save up for Apollo in the bottom of the powerful early game options for 180 across the math now it's a few early play mashups and get real another possible running in later and game number one or Riu he was on to Leah did not get very effective rum to try to go bottom twice to the early game with all 10 members in the entire games going up they were out fought in those room but I think this game could be a similar style of early game proactive moved 20 + irelia is a very viable option and then loosen Flex something like from or no one of those before it can be a very strong Duo and that we can hold its own as well I went around it out on the fuse do you need magic damage somewhere in their lineup at least have that part covered both lots of tanks and flexible solo Lane are always interesting to see when the draft end up the Champions similar roles are now need lacrosse he's very good at removing that possibility what is it going to go with instead year for aphromoo available and some houses do my husband to fart play available in might be matched with hook as Aqua as a novelist yeah and then went ahead and play that front line with the aftershocks however and I was also very punishable the slow movement speed as well as the fairly low skill animazement a really well play thrash and well X plays can be difficult for Nautilus players to deal with you do it right it at least I me everything you want to do and see in power during Playmakers that's definitely true we'll see where Roscoe's on this Garner not typically a super-powerful early ganker but you guys just get there moose speed run at them and force them into a bad spot if you can land Yuri on the Garner then you can start to have some sort of impact in it deep do Leonard especially post level stick for echo-fox could definitely take off so deftly to be around keeping an eye on the jungler to see which one they do to get ahead early passing going to mean a lot intrigued by where the Negro ends up going we can see those to swap back and forth act committed become a bit more, but her there and you can see if you need to or on his ego top wait till 20 seconds to the last block come through and we can guarantee our matchups unexpected stay where they are one of the nicer matchup kind of like the harassment really on extra Wave Control those PDF that Wave Control results in are you getting something accomplished during over you as one of the new guys are trying to stick something with getting him back onto the stage she had previously been a mid-length assistant coach for the team for the entire duration and when he was taken off the starting roster and still been in the background but jumping onto stage once again last time Philly at this time with the knee go see if you can make that big impact 100 these are looking for Manhattan right now both of had long as they can certainly do it open and step up against one of the longest inning do open up on aqua Cedar Creek has been broken but total game together Apollo taco probably still number one in the league and we are on to the rec Pier all right option for invades fairly limited you towards popping up when the things you just D amazing do here on the stage Ronnie which I like for a lot of junglers you got to do that and still look you is start off with your warding trinket go place it immediately in a defensive position behind where you're going to start AKA The Red Bluff right here and then you recall and you go and get your Sweeper for your first possible gang crush is going for the in bed with his own sweeper though and he's going to counter this strategy getting the early gold and experience for his solo laners wasn't on screen there but he waited for that Phoenix could come get into range them can have both of your sole interest plus your jugular all split War gold and it still is enough for them to get that earlier level two little Advantage for your one-on-one level two. 6 minutes here and by letting her left eye means the full pen gold goes to both hello and rush for the extra gold income for fake God made you the rest of work there without much issue One Less Auto down that goes Rush meanwhile got help on his own top spot of the map on starter blue to walls of the campus of adults have the target damage of the machete for his opening belt d a permanent bank trying to push up that the minion wave goes pretty much even though silver sustaining and eats about a damaged in that trade but he still has potions everything available but the early aggressive move by 100 thieves fish opinions down 3rd Bailey memes level to get a pretty similar times but can't really trust box they said not enough space to go for the all in there and it's none of these get their own level there is no aggression just yet if I work spanning ability to knock that one down though he was so nice to not go walk up and take a trade also noticed that amazing is gone for the topside clear here starting red going down to Raptors and and Raptors up to the crugs you have a reverse with the red side perfect for ganking top and the Aurelius a Swanee we've been craving freaks might actually happen and still has easiest a pic of the sun is the akali find the first print the first killing Top Lane I'm happy we finally got to see it in action thought I was going a little crazy there really good heads-up play from amazing but also when you're facing a do like that for solo side I think you need to use your early warning trinket I see so many people ever since the Scuttle crab spawn was put to later 3 something minutes into the game they don't respect the 3-minute Jungkook angst anymore but amazing makes it happen really good stud near lined up against the wall by big God by the way allows amazing to get into c c c train that were talking about who gets the wind it up be stacked up assist Juanita passive before Suwanee was even in range for her own Auto Staci Easley got to Crockett off the end so the one recompense of Rush ran the bottom jean golf away the blubaugh body as well as amazing is stuck on just a grump being available does the entirety of the Jungle left remaining he only got take us to Camp I think that's a payment well worth it for the side of 100° and already I'd say this is their best early game yet freak you're talking about earlier about their stats they have pretty much never had a lead or a significant leaves as it was in the early game by Turtles okay once he clears out the crop as you said there's no other chance from left to go through to your kind of forced into a gay guy do something I get back to the bottom side and actually are able to set it up here do credit goes over to amazing his cell phone so that is more money into this Edge warranty not exactly where they would want it they would want to get the Lucian super far ahead Banks already up in CS and they get to push that minion wave in enforced out to teleport Rush take a look at Camp away and even awarded pop you put one down but now the spots going around yeah if you want to no rush does have flat Glass phone just yet but like I can fake God's nagging with the stun enforce The Flash come out reflexes on point for rush out they go videos still hot on the trail here to look at that solo kill this is a level even levels now a man and he lands this stud installer just recognize he can go all in if in the cloud look at the energy regeneration there a crow as well because there's a lot of many shots the whole time to artificial selection. I looked like to me as one of these best at playing to those reactions has really good even for teammates I like that we're getting more of the players and into Facebook's precious about the game but that was him after getting Kinks Lola will stop and clap while he's alive like I loved it has player to call BM lover freaks because you like to be on yourself I get lots of stuff wrong we're here and everything's looking pretty good how to pee still holding on to a slim gold lead the jungle difference is pretty real xpu eyes but is still on at these up in Gold amazing has got himself in a lane in a funny the top side is sort of in spite of it is already at a man oh yeah I like I was using the grass do solo call he's actually really good grasp user right if it's fairly easy to prepare and he's getting it on blood on this is stacking up help for the game so far it's really going to mean a lot for the tea but I really dies after that last Bush anyway was in a bad spot for him and it did allow fake God to get that extra little bit of Cs lead that she healed more than the Conqueror has from fake God's which has been so far you are a pack of Keystone but it's more of a
