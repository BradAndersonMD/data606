we are into this match here as we begin my fault it's never your fault you're right if this is a Bad cast it's all on me and you know I will live that one down to record of the defending Champions 03 win so far this place it's her first kind of on paper easy opponent in the ALCS if one else. Have Team STL should be taking care of business here just hold the dark easier for them but despite the fact that they don't have peroxide and they have been playing in 14 I don't think we can give him a pass on all of their issues because this is still for 5th with basically an All-Star team last fall for these guys first floor 1st Team all LCSkeeping everything in the office and they haven't known as much time into we are expecting the ramp up in for better individual available for clothes right away for turn fire and I want to spend a little time contrasting these two junglers because one of the complaints I have seen from TL players are very true and is that closer is the number one done with the LCS he's actually just Farmington fire is second to last in Chula Vista 15% and she's actually I'm not really lame and I don't do anything cuz it's obviously something difficulthow to hide the best performance isn't even without a sad about double us after we to add to lotion on the proximity of any bot Lane in League with you but not getting the outfit he may be used to know she'll often it's hardly has played heavily around bot Lane and they keep going back to it and I've got to say I'm so surprised it just does not seem to fit their place out, but it is a pic that is very strong the met a lot of people are performing with it so you know they are kind of Bixby screen popular you know especially when you open a clta Santa's not really played very much at all their music list 10-4 kind of rising up and take you fought alongside at math and if Elio's which are obviously not available for sale to grab at that point of the draft but see if they can kind of play around a little bit differently and finally get a win under their belt with his because traditionallyfilter on him since he was the guy that plays with the ultimate supporting your style and I have your other utility of of the shroud of the heels and it's like its purity test output is lower than a lot of these other chances are Leos Cindy sent us a note 4 minutes of worldwide in for a flight is it from it is three-quarters of the Senate average worldwide per gold in here as well he is not getting his numbers up over time if you have a number one more out of the bottleit's very interesting right because it went when you do see a weakness like this among the few teams are going to draft for the every single time they're going to try to push you toward that weakness if that is perceived that way you know one of the things that people used to do is yell in the draft in the past is they would you just blindly expected impact of playtime right boob free counter pick a tank and then kill would grab the tank anyway right it's like they blind do you think this is something that can become an issue for Cialis over half the reason they're going back to the Santa to get some window to the belt with it and prove that hey we can play that you can't just create a whole draft around 4:20 of course if there's going to 83 North the next to the last game he ever fly on 10.2mobile over-the-top like this Misfortune the other side and said to not have dashes it's so damn difficult to play safe against a 4-foot galio you had Rumble and Ken over top that gets even more difficult than it does it take to die very easily as you're saying also on top easy to hit the damaged with a cataclysm hitting someone down but also the shielding is going to be there for your for divers and this does seem like an intelligent traffic to have to see if golden Guardians can kind of feel it apart a little bit a lot of poking be available here from the Zoe and if they can get the proper setup for the MF ultimate that can be very effective alongside Buena Vista Co diving in with the lease in but that being said it's very difficult every kind of get the opportunity to stand in fire with this MF Bowl against this composition because equalizer can be layered over top of you if you're ever in range of Jaipur ghallywood they are going to be looking for you so if you're really strongI think I was FBI and perhaps a little bit of Side Lane play where aatrox I think can take over in the later stages against these type of pants and a big thing I have my eyes on a very different role in this game or away from The Incredibles. Behind behind Grandmasters Gilligan 6754 Centre on Pacific so I do think if there's one hand from sometimes a brain or to the coordination problem we are from their coach in narrow to pick up the minutes ago saying that you know sometimes we make one call Italy to the keys or he committed to that first call and he's theleft out to die that's not always his fault so we'll see if coordination will step up here for Golden Gardens or if liquid can end of the week tied for third place with three wins to get ourselves on the river see what happens what is looking like we're going to get kind of the NuWave build here for Canon something that has been very popular in the lck is Kenneth overall is a pic but actually conqueror and gunblade you need to have a tremendous amount of self-healing here to play War for the Laney face about a full year ago that have been somewhat popular along but it was more play like we say in Hindi sexy things for quite some time at the pro level but it is kind of swung back once again to this Russian word gunblade 2 worth playing for that lane and that's oddly Domino so you have to really track how much impact can get done because if you're good to go for this field and you don't get it is it that you don't have a pressure bandage you were just weaker in the team fight without having fun of them all right we'll see what they can do for this one impact go down the hole Precision tree gets the extra energy on killing us as well friends of mine does work energy Champions so C250 Max Energy somewhere at some point here unless you get some booty shot out and nothing to spice what happens in the early game equip trinket world that I believe double is spotted so they know which way they come out and if turn far does level to gank then far is indeed AutoZone Red Bluff and you cannot really lame me mobile release coming through for Haunted House close Argo a bit faster that should help in case there's any kind of weird truly game invade pasta Short Pump yeah I can have to track if he can get in involved early on here does look like a closer is going to be doing the exact same path and he is going to be buff up straight drop thank you very much for a little bit of info coming out from TLC do do I saw the Senate Pig being picked up by double at the last week he said that he doesn't believe sent as a very good Champion or that he just doesn't want a player I just got finished don't know what he says it double it is fine with the champion he likes playing Center and he enjoys that and he know he's not too bad at her in the plane so that's my two bit of information for you guys do with it what you will blink twice if they're making you play Santa buddy he also love bugs soda last we'll see if he's going to be all smiles after this one I know isn't always the biggest of guilt but if you expected to have foot on the top side and is going to be closer looking for still have that Smite but clothes are early advantage and and gold and blue has a great spell thief grabbed there with the ignite so that can help to have a little bit more pressure in this to between basic course by the Stars women at Jen's been asleep but Jake doesn't come through a little pretty much by the space is a big waves to fall in the mid lane should type the farm over all across OSU players for the top expected for impact there is not good on the back foot the top side that's what you get for getting counter picnic and coming through you can't contest every ranges between your honor trip because you're going to take too much her up early overall so we'll see how Hunter does in his early Lane if you can prove stabilized you generally go down and her so she s and then from there if you're playing it while you can come to slow that down and try to keep the Gap at that point tops, cuz everybody clean the strain fire is going to be first little for in that Caswell doublelist Anchorage AJ there double its do flash also means you get a pretty horrible to Dex the possibility is there more closer to make a move down flat bottom side I can't be more hyped than like Everest climbing on Keith and he straight-up two-on-two first floods doublelift down the book was already coming out the devil thought he was they thought he was behind that minion he grabbed him and from there it was pretty much lights out I do think it was smart to not use that you'll I do believe that wasn't and shoulders from that point I think summer is just going to be wasted so CC accept his death only positive for TL side is that the first one went to keep instead of two FBI or so the itemization know it's not as bad as it could be between those two Mark then still a pretty big deal though ExtraTorrent and extra long sword on top so that bottom Lane to be heavily you want to point out it wasn't three some of those burned for 2 so there is a Tumblr vintage back in in liquids favor to get a new game coming through crucially FBI himself has the flash but of course he does not see that comes to matter pretty soon but if I want to go difference what's Golden Gardens in the early lead most out of course buoyed by the first let itself because back in the flame it turns out here as well as himself and he should have known that for an is there if you do place. That means they absolutely no they haven't, can quitting but if they can actually put you in that wave and reset it they have enough to do so for JJ spotting clothes are there will be backing off now but no Jensen Zoe it was kind of hold this Lane pretty equal you do expect Rumble often times to have the bush but closer has been pretty active around this delayed that is going to make you hesitant to fully commit to it at one point I'm not actually is across the five teams played so far going to lose has almost identical linnig's out to Jensen very slightly better for rent in in CSD goal-difference and very slight lower overall turn the proximity they're not even having to put you to the game during golden boots has been in multiple games were always result in win and that is not just as old as this thing is it's nothing but they need to get to a point where they can take it then turn those into a you know it's not as though this has been a team sitting at 1 and 4 that it's just in case they actually had a lot of really close games that have some time just barely knock on their way to convert those bit later on 4th right now we're seeing string it again look for the bottom lay in a rare botland gang 15 liquid with his jugular and this could be the play at the time and could not land to eat to stop it nicely done by Keith's Landscaping out Dasher and try to actually got the paperwork on that Lantern I do think he was a split second too late that the lizard had already been grabbed by FBI so I think would not very effective insurance that think I don't think it was spotted at 8 and not walking through that brush so it may not know they have the flash if you do it wrong at all that is someone that can roast a jungler very very closely so you do have to be careful about that but they are looking for a date now on this Blue Book they've had Vision they have had some priority
