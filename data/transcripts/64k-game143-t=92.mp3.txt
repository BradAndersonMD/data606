Empress it really is the most people had power ranking near the bottom I wasn't Mortals in almost every Power Ranking that I saw and they've really happened proving people wrong and it's been more about Just Energy between them. How wealthy were together about finding ways to win in what are not always clean games what are some time to really Scrappy games that they have to kind of maneuver their way out of no I think a lot about that seals you win of gets ocean sole having the back door to get that Victory and had a lot of clothes and then it's not because we have in the past seen some things that are considered really strict going to Cuba anti fixie on things like a mordekaiserare in the past I came out as an answer to the you mean obviously we just saw an incredibly successful game on you means laugh and I wonder if that is something that you were going to do because if Yeezys were thinking that if they're fixing that this could be a block of puppies that are screaming and saying hey actually I'm really really try to find something is rectiv playing with Harding who kind of powder and I think something is this a sticky place that you can get yourself out of out of the heart engage this feels like a steel to me then you really really want to play as girl for all sex because as you say it's a very safe to hole in the ceiling do you want to stop for the same time to really how you view me is did with the all-in tick and egg rollsusually what you think of for that can be good to follow up at times but it's very rare lion I having the correct angles on stopping in between you and your opponent things can really make a big difference again those number 3 and please send break the chain has been scaring Play U2 camping every single game pretty good things I'll get over it when I started winning bottling for EEG but say no or an is a like top boy 5SOS but you can definitely do like an official Rushmore made against LeBlanc it's just have too much HP to really be easily breaks down that is something they could really look forwhat is most consistent X really frosted for ear feels like Everton two-bits come out he has been so good on it it is a strong match up individually against at least in that sense Darren real people talk a lot about the unfurrow interrupting me to damage there so we'll see how we can deal with laid out so far more doses of the disc golf text or more to deal with that doesn't work either conquer Lee Andrews Rushmore to Kaiser really can't match up well against that a worn a lot of percentage be damaged a lot of the same kind of deal with you on there so looking at it so that you can see inside counters there and I will see what I was giving flu is the top three picks at Kumo has had our bit so he is only place where he has a shock Williams that one game or something new there were criticisms about achieving pool last year when he did come ingas is very Reliant Apartments Jake's pick so we'll see how much he's kind of grown from that can you bring something out here that is going to look good if it is going to match up well potentially use this morn excited to see that grows from, because I do think he's the one who has been a pleasant surprise For Me Above All my expectations were and he's a player that I think has a lot of room to grow as a young. Thank you led to spell to punish you be Lanes entirely I know the Leona Banh made sense cuz hey that's the best part in Gatesville right thereAlistair which what you got to use your Roar to interrupt and rejoining with a d makepeace he actually delays you mean from being able to rejoin the females there to do something like a me support and Billy boy is a lame mean this is this is the pic that last game we saw you used to like to see into the wrong now you're picking the wrong and they already have a new me so you really are kind of working into their favor it is going to be the Renekton or Kumho up there in the Top Lane do a lot of early and Nikki and power it feels like for a Jeep know I'm looking at this squad already I feel like like they pretty much have to win early on to have a reasonable chance in the future I was born is going to give you so much Frontline so much scaling later on if that's you when there's not a relief of Frontline magic damagetax in the back line orange can stack up the armor in HP deal with those May numbers there for Keys give you a lot of stealing a grill there too and you have this really busy Frontline so you're going to have to make the most of the early game Power LeBlanc least in leasing Renekton all pair up very very well at least you could be an early dominant later so we'll see what age you can get done if they can start stacking objectives free to be gold leaf for this could be pretty easy elevation towards here Corky is 90/10 Magic physical or an indirect silver Rollins but it's still not going to be putting their first game of the week+ 2 did you make that one happened to rip the fourth and Final Table La so big they can be had supposed to squeak tied with p.m. or into time is now 4 and 4 they are already 5 and 1 I do believe so are fun to write 5 and 2 right now the game as the green foot to the sides in battle with Immortal as you know I do know it was going to be summer I don't care a little bit here and yeah I mean alright well we're going to stop what we're doing right now we've got Gabby on the side of Artemis well since I have you by my side Artemis I did just want to ask you a kind of really figure out what's going on with you you write two games in a row Ciroc a band you me and how much of this has to do with the prioritization of heavy healing in the middle right now feeling is strong and sustained and general especially with you being so rocket but with the bus we saw that you me recently and I think it's a really strong pick and we've seen LSD prioritize it pretty highly this weekend and maybe a bit slow to catch on like this osteology Pickett yesterday and one game today to pick as well as strength we think it's great and laying its gills very well and I think I can take over the game with pairing like LeBlanc and a Truck seems like this so we're pretty confident that we bought a practice on it and I'm excited to see how it how it goes quick question for you before I get to go and watch it obviously Warren Perrin was a big heavy portion during the last game you just named a couple but is there anyone in particular we should be marking out for as priority for you me okay with you me this game is going to have some fun I like that having to pay first boss will talk about this first then we'll talk. You need it more but they're Mortals have toward Vantage Advantage find Avenue me is there but if that you hit Bank. Probably plopped down smoke lens do in Basel can push him around just going to run and patience very soon I got to be careful this one is the alternate how to become a marksman steering committee is running in the health field and have a great time in a really rough but the kills going to come through it just okay is donated $700 The Mortals that was a terrible in babysitter for so long and then the balance split away from Xfinity leaving him alone with basil and back it was why are they trying to do fully committed chasing Spence Karen Wright Innova skill-shot the Mist now you need to just go back to help your jungle actually finish this but instead and Hawk will be completely charging after Karen Huger not even able to get in range of the hit if he is ignited surely going to die and he spends a flash so fat goes to worse there but that was just a terribly organized invade from Immortals and they're going to be kicking themselves really far behind off of that I mean their level one they treated support classroom in flat did you take should have been down a Summoner and having a rough time is too early kill well is going to start taking over this game you have to assume but both on a gold necklace is what in Mortal going to work through them and he's only down kind of half of a campaign that evaluates get paid less than legal 12 but the kills the kills are really really big I mean we talked about how he zhi kind of needed to Snowbowl early game as now with clots coming through here but just in case his face so that you can probably go out of his way out but you know I'm right at level 100 LeBlanc that's going to be feeling incredible I already a very big early by here I can want to play this land offensively to scale-up that becomes much more difficult when your opponent has all this early gold injected into him realtor didn't really get a chance that can touch on it is Omni Stone Corp was really surprised by the power in this is constantly applying a having a low cool down and being able to constantly lies them in Reigns versus rain matchups I feel that is much more difficult if you have a match up that you were bullying as a range Champion maybe you're getting a lot of product out of it I'm going to be kind of Institute actually talking it but right now, because he was so ask then go back and forth so cute so use comet in like a charity fight who would tell you how to conquer and press the attack Middletown pool and Healing Place on him as well as well with on this phone so I see how it works also where you will for sure get as long as you're able to write over something like they put work into that is giving you your guaranteed guaranteed Keystone coming out into the steam pipes but this is the only does and the other thing is interesting about this is that actually prioritize W Predator when you coming out of base now be a gangster from Spencer graduation this one knows you have plastic some good for the damaged but don't you come down and get some shots there in Spanish pushed off at 1/2 HP till I honestly think that's a great game from Spencer and you know he can go back to me soon I could just keep be back out and lost about half of his self he has no function so and that is going to get really difficult against my opponent so let's reset this let me get a free base and try to get back out on the map not terrible also of note is because he's a market into a dumpster to buy that really she helped him get some of the extra power early on but I really do like you as well I think it's actually a hugely beneficial ruin to just get you on the power spikes when you can't always do it that's why I like that pick up a lot in the Articles of graphic that if I could bring pictures that's it's interesting and I'm just I think of something that is largely unexplored especially the Predator interaction I really do think can have a lot of value you know when you're thinking about your core he wanting to get package and we can work out of it as somewhat similar way or just give you look up your package was on the map with that bullet speed from the package at the front of the route to discover a shout or nice curly pressure there is a force mid was pushed a force that recall off the hike up here as well and so the reference tables with great so far in that bottom Lane you can see that it was actually All Tech Force onto the sheen buy new trying to have a little bit more power to try to combat this is not going straight into the tear the fact that up as fast as possible we can have to go back to that later on so this will slow down his stealing a little bit but he just feels like hey you're getting fresh with this I believe already lost a fight you need to have some, power now a while but slow but goodies Burbank to Duke backwards it's really no way to threaten to kill on Lucian when your support is Rob like right there and I can't get a whole lot done there is one of the rooms at hard to get rid of because you need to have fully stacked before it actually goes away and Conquer to actually make it to cycle out that is a bit eventually I'm going to curious on your thoughts about lethal tempo as you look good to me it does help with Frontline killing and I've been seeing this pick up a little bit more there's not really a great room for Ezreal he had been gone conqueror by missing one more lethal Tempo kind of word additional attack speed which you need a lot of when you're trying to kill Frontline but there's not a ton of that in this game station in haste based on
