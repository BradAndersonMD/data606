very big pivotal moment for the entire series track is it snowing at the analysis was actually talked him out and we'll send money to your room that it's been three straight games for thika is certainly getting his Groove how much stronger game during the game 3 of any had him wanted to so do you want to take that away from him know they haven't been eating the Jarvan quite a lot but we try to push him down even further what happened to hear Club Tammy of course the blue side off and have some freed up and you see again that red side uni band to get to keep their to at 8 a.m. that has been the whole way through to get the one free. This time around and see what else would he is a must be removed because when it's ya trying to get all of the bands on a hoonie from the red side is so difficult because he talks about red tide Hats play the uni band switch up here so they are blankets it looks like he will get one of those GPU or rumble or something and I most like do the KC rate box so it looks like the bands are really much different they were at last time we had two teams on this side is always have always refers Pinkett and Will Not a blue spice they can't force pickets what's the band was the one final option and rakan goes off again not aligned is Ira conduit for last year culture can be found at the Verizon looking good trout Series clutch bar again as long as they want it because what's the weather for out with split will be silenced first pick this is the same draft we saw in the first pic when they were blue side in gay member to Idaho so well get them had a lot of very good ultimate for him to seal knows they want me from all these things will see if that is the case this time around is always a little bit riskier when you blind to just exactly sure what you're going to get your 40s and the time around driving a silver for themselves finally pushing Clutch Gaming in a something different for Cody sun down there then goes blank during the regular season the most played for Cody sun was in fact desire they've already pre band out of a consew friends at least another 200 even if they will allow of the tired to come through quite a bit of was actually Zaya as well as Nautilus as a Duo so I wouldn't be surprised Steve that go through and without driving on the band table speaker will be selecting the bad self no more good morning for him without being prompted by clutch driving definitely has a lot of early possibilities go left level 2 Gang Sivan all right there it is. I don't know what surprised that all number nine of the what counting playoffs going to be played so far so 1 final take for Clutch Gaming has been for Cody son of for that pool with narrow down even further I think it will be our we could see if you know him go a different direction but for that late-game we'll see if he does elect to do the to your bills this also pairs well with a nautilus that Vulcan does like to play quite a lot of Pi that CP have a plasma as a follow-up Rumble as well as as Silas Marner be kind of diving in so I can follow in front of help assist in that back on. Nation yeah we did see Clutch Gaming utilize this pic effectively in the summer split allowing Cody sent to jump to a lot of these scrimmages in a hive prom is going to be the lock in here once again though just dance again if you want to deny the Brom from your opponent's if you are the one playing silver as well so it makes it a good pairing it is going to make it one good open Falcon steel though last game we saw this earlier he was think that's wanting in the brahmins it's wanting the Brahmin had her to Pieces by the need it so badly she pretty effective to is that considering that is never let you know there's no Dak or if they were to be able to get out of that ultimate so you steal the day for ultimate you're setting up for the rumble very effectively be able to drop the equalizer over Whoever has walked in there so already I do think that lyric has a pretty effective off to grab alright what's up it's kind of been away some of the Demonte Champions tier Keanu was effectively use last time they had set up with Rumble and Silas Aurelius the first one to get Sam Bann out will they follow it up as ER here band away from clutch they think TSM is going for that race up team fight and they're going to need some 80 threat I think that's exactly the way they are trending Alistair for Fairy Godmother specifically you can hide but that you can stop over eyes so if you're going to play with her as well that's also a possibility you're not worried about the Keanu given the Puritan should have plastic with Angela you know if you if you think that he would be going that direction direction with voice but you get the point anyway gladimir were looking like they have a right now a broken plate had some good slide games and it's been this is an incredibly strong by combo when you do have the Vladimir as well as the Zipper at the bottom or ultimate is ramping up all that damage has a dama campworld a civet civet Ricochet damage that spreading everywhere and can't be quite strong play that get them are going to have to work probably without some Lane priority early on the pending on what they lock in lactic at the final piece looks like psylocke in just looking to have a lot of option earlier this will be a soul winner you know they're going to be sending that Dallas to Seoul Lane a very likely will be middling here for Demonte but we've seen them Lanes off from uni and Demonte already Nautilus as expected no surprise there for me but this is a lot of dive this is much more early-game Focus I think than what we were thinking out of DSM rest I powerful early-game dumler turn up alongside the silence in the rumble hoof you have good push in the early games and get active and try to really know flexes recti month old Lane in the last person to reply reprise his role on a champion should have a pretty solid matter to most things good putting his safety and as long as there's life away from both struggled all right I like the link that is actually for clutch beer get them going with a lot of a leader power will see if they can get their coming back winning their must-win game forcing ipr2 game number 4 draft feel somewhat similar to me to what Clutch ran last time right you know Tristana to her as well as good as beer I do think of this is kind of feeling a similar role in that you're fighting like him to be friendly powerful but you have to get there and know if there is any bump in the road you fall too far behind her Leon be fighting an early game Power I think I may have a clutch is going to be absolutely enormous in could allow them to run over to USM all right well for you can switch things around anymore it is going to be junio trouble yet again no one's surprise to your butt boys want to see him on that camping is very good at and it's always a pleasure to watch great players on it saying it's a chance right here we are very exciting sight here still a must-win game for TSM back against the wall that got to win two more straight and they can end Clutch Gaming hope they can find their postseason move on and so my files lets them sell they want to close it out invite some more important later on in the ALCS playoffs going to pop off game just about 20 minutes ago pentakill to help secure and on this ion the fans already we already the players get out of the risk game to underway the court star game for the quarter-finals counting part that's your specialty though half credit because 4 is a multiple of 2 that's right and quick Mac correct forgot the first to get to distant so all right well looks like we're going to have defensive openings anytime there's a prom you have to locked up for level 1 so we got by with Coach artist talk about question these guys Artemis predominant first two games coming out of Clutch and then game 3 there's a little bit of a slip-up coming into game for are you worried at all that the team has lost our momentum into play as we knew they would. I think as long as we stick to our game and do our jobs will be fun to get your reactions tsm's draft away from Cody sun in the potentially going for that late game I mean Cody can play a lot he can't just only place over here so there's no trouble there and we'll see if they can make it the late game I think it would be a bit of a deviation from the strategy I'll buy it again as long as we do our jobs will be fine at all again we just do our jobs movie fine thank you and best of luck to you guys do your job felis and we'll be fine at 2 a my job is to laugh absolutely moving on or into the game it is going to be having the heavy Labour party top he went back to the comment no surprises there is that is kind of the rumble standard and even in that that grass Rumble game in the movie mash up earlier I did to actually check in The Grassman you got two triggers of it throughout the entire Lenny face so it really didn't do anything for him but he should have fallen priority in a broken plate really doesn't get to have fun in this matchup in until really liked Post 9 and even then you're going to be getting pushed in very heavily so I will see what he can make with this Lane pressure AC valve Rumble Auto pushing with the flame spitter under Tower and trying to force missed CS through that message right now you can see it's actually a fairly effective only able to get to early on we are mixing early visit down bottom there is a word here goes for it that was not the most impressive engaged there but either way not much committed either they are going to speak is here though now and it may not actually be anticipating this they can go forward knowing the right size is very like he's not there really destroys the tunnel as well as barely get that Cannon minion with the execute big was hovering around the side of the map here to support honey anytime you have uni uni Auto pushing here on the rumble trying to deny see us through the Vladimir any further xtra-vision and presents from the right side early on will make him more confident and throwing out these Harpoon really trying to make broken played mrs. many as possible ever doing pretty well that's why are there only being down to five Cs not too bad at this point I don't want to see you know what they're going to take us probably actually going way too far for a backup from broken plate you do anytime Rumble walk to you in this mess up early on you have to walk away and it looks like he felt that he could kind of take that Tray Deee certainly was not able to as demonstrated their but I'm down here on the bottom side things looking fairly even I've had this gift I'm getting kind of the early ages with their xayah rakan so this is certainly a little bit less pressure than I think they'll be used to having on the 7th Ave and take a look at how this team is going so far it's Bill top wind pressure broke a blade is really thinking why I do have one as well that you were the roots voices are very really, he's got scorching there as well level pain and perfect timing to get a late-game stopwatch so certainly is heavily favored in the rebels pushing him in Windows for a few minutes here but I will at least four say pretty referee calls only on the Ruby Crystal not ideal atomization but as long as you survive and keep talking that farmer going to be feeling okay I'll be ready soon as you stealing up that middling is playing the fuckto porky so happy to farm it out there and it really it is going to be on clutch to make things happen at CSM I think will be very happy to play a farm-style game so nothing is more in there we allowed during the regular season was not TSM really being the dominant early game and it was more of a flaky to keep license and getting their star player I want to stealing Champions where they could really make things happen and once I got tonight and in order to do that clutch probably looking at Lira. No pressure recall off on the side long sword to back it up a little bit he's making some heavier move down into the jungle with this all Elena was pushing up our side level 5 with flat definitely can't be underestimated hail of blades as well pilaris a lot of first a possible and there is an entire full level over speaker right now they're both about one for the way the next one so it has been a bit early start for Leroy overall goal 300 and savory co-defendant the pretty nice DP back Tulane vs was already there so it's not the marijuana bill it is going to be the rest of storm early ocean are beets very very well to play out these next minute to the game stuff right here topping still pushing course 49 to 30 and see if that's not too bad there's a way to be Farm So within 10 that's pretty okay here in Midland close to equal 2 cups of Nancy putting jerks in the head in that one yeah I think that ocean Drake such a big denial as well if he is dead get their hands on an ocean trade with each batch of for themselves it is be dream scenario early cuz that really helps them just Farm it out and get to the lake in that are trying to go for so clutch really happy to get that one off the map and start that Dragon timer ticking away meanwhile as we mentioned Lira. Level six on the right side pretty big Power farming lead in the jungle see if he goes in to try to make a play pretty good for
