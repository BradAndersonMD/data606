it has just been TSM looking down and being like they are not that far apart in the standings right now so if CLG get this Victory Tye TSM in the standings to his point I think that's one of the things that reignites the Rivalry in the players in the team's themselves if you can make it happen on stage gear that's what has to happen honest I think it's much more on stereo. Back up what they've been saying and it's so true it is talking about how much he has sent was heads and shoulders above CLD it was over a thousand days since I don't get me a glass of eating Chia 72 Matt Street was finally broken a few blocks ago that you can yes right field is a winning record they were 10th Place flat split they've got the pants that tie for third place they wouldn't hear TSM tintypesecond With the Wind near these are top of the table teams that can beat a top-end morality at them against them fix a replace double if it won a championship with seals eat at the table to the same and its Affiliates blocked in double can easily be that botlink Focus carry that through fairly of everybody loves one of the best tailors in the game ruin probably going to be the one on Bolivar it's still going to be a flex pic but he was one of the first one to fully embrace the rework koala bear and try and use it in Lane super aggressively actually really like some of the early looks at they got with that champion some of the early wind I feel like that started some of the momentum for the comeback for the squad early on in the line of a champion play before in this split but not a highly prized looking atif you can push me into him he don't have a lot of defensive tool to withstand that there's life skills sometimes but not great and so I want to see if they could really take that with the biofrost and set up some more components to make this early Misfortune pickworth it is very good especially against Ofelia so I do like the mule Misfortune Pacific matchup but also I want to see the whole team comp with cc to set up those ultimate for stick say he has played it earlier there were some unlucky plays some Mitch plays where you know he would get quickly interrupted I remember one from a a prom ultimate but looks like he's going to have to avoid a couple things here Leeson and orange both walked in on very good hitting ultimate obviously on stationary targets and wanted to run in this game you talking about a we set up the fact that full of air is whatgoing to go either way they got really could have come through instead we're going to see how to get to cut a support role as kind of gave you a lock-in Nautilus here for Smoothie leaving Midland and a Top Gun go up in the air in a bit was going to be kind of guarantee that we'll be at the band start going through options to Keep Us Alive I do think that smoothie definitely deserves some credit for his Nautilus play it that's farthest but it's it's been a big part of their engages Nautilus as well as they work on the thesis more bottomland Focus the fancier should just continue playing at the ports get them taking away some of the Blind Pig Ogdensburg pobelter TF in Oreana both off the table or two of his vet Champions and obviously two of the most prevalent in The Metayeah of course we are going to eventually get a lot more roaming by the way as well I think she's been criminally underrated as a mid laner for very good at supporting by the way Morgana mid in the shield comp by tovi and In dr.axe odesza Bloom here in North America or it's like that one dragon eggs game just got it leads to a lot of these multishield Morgana plus a Karma cops but I like that you open the door for possible Purex and pick because I also know that he has been playing the AP mid Nunu andis is viable in this composition as well you want your other phone to set up the Orange is there that's great you have a really good afelio scaling a deep threat so they're the pieces are here to set up for a possible AP Nunu as a cop but 1013 playing Dark Harvest I track two of the top Callender's in Korean solo spamming it and I'm just fingers crossed for it but it just opening the door on it at least for a minute and just see if it comes through DSM going to Buck the trend of defensive options are not going to feel for double if they're going to go into seal GH Wright Havoc is Leona is locked into have a ton of really good and gate construction cuz obviously lead for double Queen up no problem too full of air is Blackfin jungleand more damn it comes through for TFM great champ overall office you can go I mean anytime we always see a zero and a failure to pick together skills like a broken record azir brings self dealing with also benefit the Affiliates player and sets of a crazy good late-game 5e 540 attempt to look at the sealed you died I want a little bit more investment in some early game here with most Corgi pics now because they bumped it over a couple patches no longer burn staying on you being able to even land the slow on people by dispatching them with the package is opened up some really cool offensive plays for the mid laners a note which that loves to me I'm sure most missed field somewhat on the field besides that we looked at we saw that really am okay here we go get Point Camp Island the top Corky can pile over the top but the come kind of got rounded out pretty quickly and I honestly I'm looking at the engage on the side from TSM trying to evade Leona + or in combination is really difficult especially with how good speaker has been on lease in so I'm at my eyeballs on the CLG carries for sure to to check their positioning cuz it's definitely going to require some good Play It Again the battle for second and third the Rivalry hopefully reignited being top-tier both together for the first time in a while after they met in final so many years ago. Bonsu and shake out and get the better of their opponents in this game through in a broken play will do battle topside I really want to see it you know I have to double with was talking about if this game is a banger I really do want to see The Return to the top for these two teams see if they can push each other to the limits ventev openings and you get your recall on Wiggly as you can see on the map there the topside he dropped his defensive trinket War then you switch over by recalling and buying your sweeper early for volibear because Volver is very good early ganks it just ensures that you are not being seen as you go for the first one and give you a lot more options for clearing out enemy Vision some quick checks around the map is going to be a bot line so I bought side jungle start for speaker ruin walks up and puts a wart to COK indeed BK is running at rest off no surprise there least list for Wiggly going to let 6 days a week to get a bit of Bruce Lee Lane controlled look like it felt that it was free to focus fire the early minion but it shouldn't really Diamond sing guardless Christian spell the first cancelled your second model of time comes between the two please go down and one of the big differences in the comps is is a force the top side of the Gangplank fair for ruin with the grass now that stuff does not in the game anymore trying to farm up and continue latest activehealth versus the orne your focus is on gold generation getting the most out of your passive out of those extra shots you want to try and get multi explosions with the barrels so you can cash in on multiple minions with a single cast but also keeping your eyes and balancing your Mana for those grass products would be there is queue Camp Rock the grass so it's very easy you charge it up in time it on the minions and then fire off your cue for your extra help stacking and that's the main point of the Gangplank pick into the horn in a late-game scaling for a for damaged where is Orange trying to hand out all the ornament yeah and I got to like you going to find a crumb of it in that match for second whatever ruin a keto stop for the Q broken played trade back in his own and it with the flow Lane to get the guarantees knock up that support vets for Broken Blade push it some damage back ruined with the early push only his loss to CVS on this truck so far but again every time it gets grass with the Q broken leg straight back get some damage to players is of all top leaders who played every game for their team if you have the highest and lowest goal difference of ten or top laners in this game broken plate is number one in his number I Building 7 of players that have played so far this school generation built into the champion so this should help out and try to balance that that climbing up the rankings a little bit early recall actually after this go to Crabby see weekly ended on the the top side their ass hobo jungle is going back to get their Smyth's and I want to see if he actually makes a pass at bottom side there is the the Scuttle there for them which you can be pleased to buy as a polar bear and double if brown frogs are both pushed up so that would be an area with some CC set up that they could try and attack Bentley wants to attack these Wards as he's looking at his own jungle song okay we saw us coming we knock you down as the first three calls come through jungle in Jungle items on both sides with Lee and now not going to be in the river brush. 55th and play Ratatouille still wants he's going to land the anchor big damage on to Leona all the trouble with before they saw toward you waiting Wiggly is claiming that work you see him clearing that Ward so doublelift about prostitutes her some criticism beer set up smoothie deserves the credit on the Nautilus he lands the hook he gets there and stick say he gets all his Autos in and weight saving his double up to then you double live as the carrier for the job on his double up to get the kill really well play there by cogn Sticks a butt the same thing you got to you got to say no respect given topside as well we get a look at Rouen invading taking sociology opening up extremely good in the first stages up his game now if you'll be kind of nice and kind of cold lead what you expect for the Sisters first blood as they now in a play run the drinks give you quite far from watts and walked up and goes back to Netflix on top keep a fire in a way it's another match double Rome jungler and support over here but pobelter has the inside track and with Corky getting there I like it really who has been on both teams of its arrival reflected in the DSM just last year they traded 80 carries in her so I could it supports I should say and hold up what's an early break at 6 minutes to alter a lot of the interview time spent on doublelift in double of saying all right yeah if you can be a rivalry again if c o g step up and yet double of thin Val Frost other ones that give up the first kill on the roam where Wiggly clears a ward beforehand and CLG make back-to-back Place take the dragon it looks like they are holding up their end of the bargain free Juilliard exciting to see it come through is Voltaren viersen fight a little bit longer than midlane but it's mostly wave clear for now are far for one himself might put that bites going to take for Wiggly is at least equal and can't count will do with the next aggressive play it's going to be into this game is there something to take for quite a while to Drake's already gone and Harold doesn't spawn just yet Corky starting tear as well filter super confident here backing up it is going to give him a lot of time or later anyway
