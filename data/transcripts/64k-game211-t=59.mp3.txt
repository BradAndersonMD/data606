slaughterfish Terrier jungler in my F-150 have players trying to stay loose and what is its a very high pressure game because it's been scaring thinking about the memories from Spring where they were reversed swept in the semi-finals I mean you couldn't get more reverse Sweet Pea then what were you just about like how far can you go down getting swept before you turn it in reverse and now it's probably the closest we've ever seen but that would still require two more games it still requires Shield you two probably win the early game and it requires them to actually come up with a new strategy for some of these bands it looks like they're on their way we do have both HR and can be available here gang is a bit of a mixer as far as the bands go we did see liquor sex you playing that last time at the start of the situation so he will have to go a different routeso compared to the last time that she owed you was on blue side the new van is Gangplank previously it was Keanu the bands for cloud nine of actually hit exactly the same in the first pick of stayed the same for counter logic gaming the both of these teams had their prepared blue and red side draft strategies that actually haven't deviated all that much that was also the game where we saw it come out with the syndrome that didn't work out very well particular match-up wasn't that good and I think you're just getting Caitlin so like I think that is a risky pic given kind of familiar with in the series right you know both of those pics are available feels he is very good at it they are going to go for a con which really doesn't mean I think we're garlic who work on is paired with you just go kayle Morgana here and you can secure yourself an incredibly powerful bot Lane that still needed actually really known for I agree but I also thinkAmericana the hands of biofrost is important for them and I would not be surprised if it is Kayla Moore. If you get gas to pick you do against Iraq are in the mindset of even in the counter match her pain is just so good you can't do anything has taken away then there are there of being a little bit defeatist almost kind of putting yourself on the back but they were certainly 10 with levels and some items search I hope they're very effectively in and hold on at that point but in the early levels I really expect the temple to leave very early in the day for this kid who should be pushy who should be working on those three plates and this is going to be a new point of power in a way that I don't think we've seen four killed you yet in this Siri i'm because they have not had a Dominus hoodie to match up yes strongest vs beerus when was solid but not dominant to your client has a trade sovery strong to a doofus coz it's been a strong point to them Karma getting out of the van last year and I I do want to see if Kiana comes through as well right that's the farthest Series in one that should really looked out for him I was really surprised to not see it banned because nisky would be the natural person to just pick it up again since you can Flex the Silas around to so many different positions but it's actually Cloud 9 hookah pens it because they're not willing to blank ticket for give harveyville to can't to pick it and then counter second thing this graph phase where Cloud9 is deferring to steal G in the draft face both with the Caitlin Ward and now what their own Kiana band so even though it's still 2 1/4 c o g of a mention of the draft is it definitely does soon as the one thing I will say about this feel like they're going to stay here for this keyand then you are setting yourself up in a situation where perhaps they feel hate you could be here I can counter pick it I can go for something like the Veigar that he's big he's brought out the path and had a lot of death with or maybe he feels that there's some imagine he's forcing his opponent into that he can then dominate in that case I think it makes sense but yeah I really tend to agree that from what we've seen revealed us far Stihl BR are certainly getting the better end of it and it feels like five nine or the ones out of plane to the tune of their Trump a draft wines out is Oriana is locked in as a very soon as you pick 4 power of people I believe his most played all time II on that list I want to force band away so now it's time to be charged with you or you and I think almost guaranteed we could see such wanting but I but I am expecting the Jade for I think they want to have work was it engage mean that's a verygood team comps for c o g skill test on the guy who can create solo kills instead of putting in the middle and they put them more comfortably at Top Lane good late-game initiation and it's going to be on Scenic way through will probably be a stylist Midland hope that we can get super fat again and then place your shoulder so what this is all about flying through play Clyde is actually an incredibly strong massive into the akali in the in the stealth so you can actually in the Shroud if you hit him with the eve review and you can pull them out with your tether as well the Grievous wounds on the Q2 that rifle is also very very powerful to the snap predominant matchup and if you still both but you can't take that around the map and look for hard engages with this but most come out in the ALCS was really ineffective to be honest with you and I I don't think we have seen few too many really a double game see how precious they are. Twice one in one on it I also think we have to keep our minds open to power he was going or Ian at top right killer probably all right we'll see if the old you can continue on the way to reverse sweep or Cloud 9 can close things out when they should have in game 3 every early games cuz guns allowed signs way every mid-game has gone Cloud 9 way it's been up to them to close out the games and more often. They have to still be reinvigorated off they come back when they've got another solid skin marks on there if you want to look very good I think both Caitlin and silver are very good of late game as well scene I have much more petite body composition lots of ways to go forward Chloe Dancer to feed you off excited to see how this game does play out of the load off the rip give me about a way to play the crowd erupted gear as we are heading into what could be the final game shop for me and everyone up for what could be the last game of the series or the reverse sweep yet again the second stop here is Game 4 in before we get into the game out right B. Wrist anybody with Arie play Grandma's gentleman what an amazing comeback for counter logic gaming last game tell me Irene how were the players feeling coming into game for so I think I've started the match up but actually play to wear so we're going to be late game and we are very good at tenpines comp and they either good prank and we just won the last in Python V1 awesome and looking at this position looks like you want to go aggressive again do you feel like you're matched up well against Cloud 9 4 game for much easier than chemistry because I think I'll have time so we can care for all the game happy for others Lane so I can thank you so much for the inside the action and speaking about the early game jungle pathing really have to pay attention to Wrigley vs. Fenty remedios brought up a point on the NLCS bit Wiggly look more head than normal in game 3 he ended up being level seven on Ruby's almost 14 1/2 minutes into the game but it's because a lot of his early game dammit which had been successful in the regular-season have not been successful in the series and you start to second-guess yourself throughout a series of the jungler there but if he can remain decisive and not remember too many of the early games that didn't work and continue to be proactive that's where I think we really due to the fact of play a game and now they can't track her ever get the AutoZone I see a really really big deal this bottling going to be even worse than it normally is the match because that drink it time to send Karen for really being able to track and anticipate weekly Collier to pretty much every juggler in your league and that is why he is a potential MVP candidate that is why he was the only member not to liquid in the first all team Rhino he has been so dominant Billy has not slowed down at all can do right now he's on his truck so we can put it on for the garbage walking down to the bottom side and it looks like a big leaf has a good sense of what Spence Karen's up to and he clears away the fact there are no words can I see post one video into camps in a sting The Crow If It could damage. Heathen ways to find that killed and it's based on a wiggly he's not going to go for any more damage cuz the minions being around 140 do first what does go to CLG wow so incredibly aggressive but they killed go to file Frost and then to nisky and the dive as possible top way around he's looking a lot of damage there liquid all the way away so it's going to take us can knock up here very well with the electric night was there and the double shield not enough to keep him alive and then his breath Place really well by 6:00 a to slow down this key as it came in and we do to be able to get enough braids damage here that with the rest of his team coming out of the minion spoke to him he wasn't sure to finish off that kill yeah so that was an attempt to break the lane Wine open probably doesn't write sneaky able to teleport right backhand Lane both flashes Burn only assist gold going over to stick say they can still be an advantage in that matchup of looking at the Gold 250 and no real experience so I'm loved the Gaucho by Steely to go for that play and I think C9 fairly accurately try to defend it the one thing I will point out is that the item by was pretty for 4C he has enough for a dagger no health potions so you know I do think that is fairly significant against this really poke Abby Lane one bad one bad trade you can be sent back to base there's there's no really cushion here without those oceans in the same state is slightly CLG favored 100 their lead that's famous First Blood paying for it to have one under the toppling went very badly for ruin to me to find liquor against look like 2210 Siesta is he forced the really rough ruin recall is he still 36 to 21 it's definitely a toppling favor for class 9 completely agree and it's also going to be about whether or not Midland can be favored for Nicki but as long as he just all any room here is so critical for this man to be favorable for licorice a little bit longer you want to delay as long as possible there so that if he goes into the Shroud you still can have a reveal use both Aaron and now you won't do it to be scared you know when you are dismounted if you have no current there is the potential of just getting first down before you can read now level 60 seconds licorice to the little wise to go for ruin the big damages found right there in a Flash solo kill only pick up the scrap with their first successful series of plays in the early games bit series at stage at the solo kill toppling they repeat. I bought this time the kill goes over to stick tape and that's has to infuse them with even more confidence series of play for them because you say there's going to be able to start fresh mint into his heavily Mperks LED this message we get really bad actually from behind so this is a very risky flight if you were hanging around without high courage you're not going to be able to reliably remount before getting birth sound he tried to flatten sure can Whiplash in a straight line got disconnected on and taken out and I love ruined flashing for the auto and then perfect timing of getting all of his passives off and also just licorice can feel good about that one really tough here now is when you are behind if a 14er force o-6 to this base immediately anytime you get to spend it because excuse give full value as if you were full health on amount doesn't actually recalculate as your 100% HP of your discount will kill you every single time and that is why when you fall behind his flight in the match of like this it is devastating. So very happy for but then they can control that way rather than going directly towards Butler and we have a CS Advantage for liquor so he can still get back in this with a Play-Doh if his jumper is ahead and get up there
