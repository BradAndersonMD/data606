we get to see this build up here yeah we're going to see it happened it happened right now for Golden Gardens topic pretty solid Wyndham sells takedown flyquest last week though we'll see just how strong these do you need to get ourselves into Champion Select every single game at Academy so far I will see if it's up here for contracts like that one two times as well as we are on Pat 10.13 that means we had some Calista nurse in the belly Ochsner has come off the table a little bit more often talk my bucks I think more likely have an AP bit later than is a pot liner contracts not going to get that looks like they're going to respect a little bit there with the diddly band pretty hot the ash let's talk about this for a second because this is been a worldwide friend had a really strong Resurgence especially an LPLlck because she is but the crowd control arrows it's best if you get out of fog of War do I really have enjoyed the sequencing an lpo and lck as as one of the main counters to move faster tire kit he has a very slow-moving attack platform heels by the outhere you can during Hurricane you can do more cryptoverse to see which way she ends up going to go ahead and grab a beer as well as raise gets locked in there were some very small a little while receiving more more folder jungle definitely still The Eclectic either Sunday or contract I have talked to contract I know itlikes playing polar bear a lot in the jungle so we'll see if that is the actual match up in one of the Champions that has a decent amount of answers you can smoke bomb what is charging and if you save your e - 4 for the volume that you don't get it by the slow mix a lot easier to kite him and you can prop your face so I think it is a good early pick up a ton of gold and Gardens there and then they pick up the time change what does it did Niall whenever you have asked it really helps to take away Tom kench to save people that get hit with the arrows but also you know if it's a batch for your team as well yeah of course with Rush locked and it's not it's only denial but it does make a lot of sense of Ash what's going to go on for that one that makes a lot of senseby fear and yes but I'm not the best at getting away from find as the band thing coming through trouble going to be a another Jungle Band in the way a contract that means the tops of your Wild on the graves trundle in Italy for the Aldi's today yes definitely excited to hear very well could again still be the volibear and they're going to have to reveal if it is Top Line or bottom land first so I expect golden Guardian first pick on the second round of pic do you want to be one of their other solo laners I would expect midlane actually because it's easier if you can pick like this do it right now cuz I put a lot of these Global Champions that one there would be with the ultimate for 12 old yeah and this is going to be because I do want to see who's going in the Champions want to be the first end of the fight and that means there's not a good and Galileo die Target in letter grades go in toppling we're not going to see Nocturne for closer cast EP is going to be the Midland answer to Caleo he's going to attack Mr but probably still going to be for Laine pressure out of Randall overall what kind of a gauge reads be out of authors are the top side we need his fixed he's going to have counterfeit to your nephew's get to the side where the bullets are goes which match if you want to go for their 80 Focus actually though so we started seeing a yellow Korean Toe with you there's a couple of dark harvest the blame for the jungle if we made it pretty much the same Renekton is locked in there you go we get the contract volibear all right have a good one free one from this list which comprises is not a Jace tfcon dalio yes you can Global end of the team but he's not the one to interrupt practice I think they need a team fighter gear for Hunter the top by tenant that combo going to line up the back line in the Galleria can dive right over the top just a lot of gate very strong team flooding the issue I like this look the following composite yeah I mean people can still remember Hunters Canyon at Worlds with DSM he's going to have to get in there with the flash a lot of time as well to either mentioning his appointment for engaging for Golden Guardians in making this whole team cops come together in the last pics to put a lot of pressure on him on his flask World on single most important spell cool down in this entire game moving forward for both teams to keep track of yakking to be a really really big deal again look at the Golden Garden composition they've got Frontline I've got a mix of damage type center lanes look pretty solid we know again galio yeah he's not to have pressure against Cassiopeia most certainly but he can at least a cat magic this pretty cleanly and feel okay about that one you don't get the Adaptive Helm or an Abyssal mask early on in and it kind of withstand that lane and then just get out somewhere else and feel pretty comfy I've been liking FBI knew he quite a lot overall not going to have a ton of pressure Ash poke is only going to be so good but they can only survive ganked on that side so I look with that look is I'd like the composition of side though we do have another game of Sunday on so you can take over the game is a game right they've gotten him off or on duty since Week 1 and saying hey let's give you some more pressure and if they can have some top pressure come out of the Jungle if they can get contract up there for some game Sunday to Monday night games like usual and it's is really interesting too because Golden Gardens were hovering the super hard Lane counter of Quinn into an accident and I use the dash you try and interrupt and they went with a can in it can be a much harder Lane counter if you go attack speed on hit Kennen and you go a deacon in but it's so much more important to the team overall that he go a pee for their v e v that I'm very curious to see how important they value shutting down Sunday specifically he is build path is going to give you a lot of insight into golden Guardians thinking behind this can infect and sent they didn't go with the Quinn it makes me think that they're going to trying to get by with the Deep earlier levels of you start with a doran's blade and then you can build into Proto belt and you can build into zhonya's and is AP items for the Canon to have it be back before the team fights later but you see I still get the edge of I'm range matchup I have this done so I can come out from my W's and you get your extra harassment of the door in slave girl might see a late invade that trigger wardwell place to spot it it's kind of nice the track most movies out there and indeed there going to try sweeper was in reign gold content about the FBI shared alongside closer ever going to look for that late invade on the bottom side which hey by the way already sniffed out 100 thieves a $0.40 contract to meet outside of this coming Sunday at the concert we haven't helped Amanda Lane you got a flash early instead that's smart there from contracts he does not level inability early when they see Hunter on The Invasion PWC fuel goes for the Sun get to be summoned immediately and that is going to reduce so much of the counter for the lane pick up early on Canon wants to try and harassed Renekton obviously if I hit the door and start you get your Autos off you drop into the frosting dry cleaning a grill but that assumes you so much more difficult now that they have to split the map and he has no flash to be afraid of red stuff can you stuff a math book 4th grade is a faster than the chicken stock and his jungle the same time. Contracts does increase the damage of Tom kench very much does not going to be in too much here easy pick up with the flu for closer once he's done Auto in a couple more times and Gretel for that one down and you can go off next to a camp but they're so yeah we'll keep that roughly one Camp leave for the golden Guardians jungler what comes through later on if they fail up and get more items in and look for those big play yeah you you mentioned the fact you're clearing that's an issue that's exactly vated by the fact that he had to level the burn the flash of Kenan you're not starting W your your first gifts going to be a lot slower there took him a while to do the red you seen on the Triborough Schwarz closed his heart he would tell about to get really dangerous if I can find plastic doesn't know they know that we can keep the damage and yeah that would have been one more strike would have done it have to be respectful is been spoken to help make sure there was a fight happening there hopefully is okay here farm at the second one and those are all the things I like about that kind of chicken in Atlanta Camp Hill PA into the galley oh is that not only do you have really good scaling PPS options for later for the Cassiopeia because she has a really easy pumpkin farm Lane Leon vs galio bite leaves today doesn't doesn't get yanked but my ass is so good against galio now that he can't do no, classes and stuff like that if you set down the stairs only Mobility from galio comes from his stomach hurts Bellbrook used to do with with all the extra speed that can get off and it is Cloak and cycling now is Summoner spells so those are really only like the prize cards that you that you now have to worry about and kept if she has a lot of answers with with holes in my asthma white sauce with heavy up the top and side haunted slightly down and dies with a lot of that is the wave is pushing into him contact Phil wants it all off to die but I just delete EP Fernandez the mid laner forced out of Lane and wanted to get some more down the cake will happen again but it is do you think resting a lot of time into this Sunday we can get them and that's what you talking about fans have been crying for 400 these Champion resources and there's any contracts up there 24/7 repeat ganks this does mean especially since you're playing versus Braves the graves should always take those opportunities to go counter-jumper you closer has done exactly that and has earned himself a level lead up several camps now and you have to start to worry about control of dragons and possible Dragon stacking for Golden Guardians if you invest that much on to the top side of my nose hit their my Sunday in October in both junglers recall closer is up a longsword in gold right now that we've almost exactly two diamond swords that are otherwise the items are pretty close together is holding true pot shop going to reveal what else am I spaghett I just drives me so much more into the mat when when you have these situations like contracts finally getting his Resurgence in the ALCS in his first game against the Golden Gardens with spent two years with him and got Bandstand got traded away I do know that there is there's definitely an extra incentive for him to communicate well prove himself worthy Christina Grimmie singing somewhere closer so just focus on topside I don't expect that to change continue try to focus on some Des Plaines and that would mean and that would also and pay getting ripped failed in 1 and 1/2 minutes because clothes are already for Golden Guardian the movie level leaves and Grace gealey biggest dragon I'll be so I'm going to go for the stars but make sure there's no words in the pit there weren't any Double Take It Down vs a recall for up for affiliate for Cody Sun you can get caught with plug boot for the ash no problem and will be with him through his clothes and wants to the matter at the red goes downtown directions to closer in the farm game stick lotronex beef yep and I guess that's for the repeat games up onto the top side which look at the DS consoles. His flashback and he is CS is still ahead of Sunday who I think I would have arranged to the queue to buy text at 1 but I'm just dealing with the pressure at this bar completely fine that used to go back to school for the clothes for the 2DS leave the dominions the ones that are late knock down and topside is making it difficult to see if dichos do you link charger has been some days when I'm closer going to be on the ward contract is here one earbuds jump over the wall and he's going to wait around for that cool down and there we go he was afraid someone slapping on him in case I am death in the most critical part of that interaction because both sides don't like they were baiting the extra reward their 400 East gave them the confidence that with whom already wrote the bottom side Lisa by himself actually let's see if he gets
