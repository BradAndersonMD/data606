a little bit quieter in lane and Sunday in contracts to create all the acting up on the top side a lot of people have started to throw a lot more fans towards someday but extremely cheap stuff see what they do with your Twisted Fate right after that pretty much hundred percent pick ban this bar contracts the target is on your back from Right Out The Gate Middle he's only won one game in the ALCS it was in the hands of contracts throughout the split were talking about Closer Closer Closer number to All Pro jump lift in the spring split he's truly one of the big Terry's for Golden Guardians he is tied for first for most kills of LCS game to split end of the jungler no less yes close was great contracts blows most of his early game stats out of the water first Blood rate five out of seven 71% fruit blood rate for contract the man gets it donegold lead the XP lead in the early game he gets it all done absolute to nominal jungler in the early game Guess Who want to see him play around someday that's a big magic for us here at the band's going through a bad delay for Demonte I was just as you were talking about before with the grades of Italy and the contract Olaf comes through foreclosure Golden Gardens want to pinch early games done with and I will still want to see them go to push a drum style midliner for Demonte have been taken out but you can still do things like Echo but I have a very similar purpose or you're trying to help with that big wave and get some rum. Threats of internal conversations about you know that it affected they said they actually came out I will say that it was picked as it wasand if we see around play LeBlanc which he has it all splits over like a few lysandra it would be the reason why does the same things that you're looking for you can be an initiator for Devante with a heart CC so it definitely does look good especially in those situations vs. LeBlanc but Olaf karma is the name of the game book that jungle her up we talked about so many time specially with this combo adding the speed and shield to Olaf makes your late game a lot more effective and not going to lock it in and this round a little bit of a beat there but still really wanted to get locked in in round two of their choice here before it gets bad to weigh cuz I really doubt that, with drop-down do the second phase of pics maybe if Elias the rest of the family goes to your FBI is going to play that every single time and dad are at 3 to go to play David championyou are right they want to spend the full minute or thrash was a productive cough what are they Banning what are we losing what are pillows going to be okay it lines up it's going to be, right I like how it was going to go cuz it was always a fairly Oceanside yes you might have to run cleanse against much BC that I be difficult we don't fight the lantern instead of his good comes out after it's a cold, and I dropped off the map so I expect hundred thieves to Blind something for a Ryoma gear you know Oriana Zoe those types of Champions Midland and then they can save their counter pick for red side for some day to get an advantageous backup for him Hitman contracts at work so beautifully toAdvantage 100 thieves on that side of the map so that's why all these Top Lane bands are coming through golden Guardians want to take away option for someday and someday trying to protect himself here I will say karma candy what's tier Demonte can't pick it up for the split that was another champion with very good wave Queen who wants to run down to help someone out everybody who you go on like an Alistair suddenly instead and the whole team comp looks different in the way it plays out you're expecting car but nine times out of ten to go down to who he there based on what these players have been doing but I could see it fit the composition you seeing more Champions with Riesling cage tools taking off the bath is Rubble loses the R button as well. But not been played by Golden Gardens at the split but it would certainly work the tenant is it take to be the Top Lane. Never feel good and all your matches what you got in a lot so I think I'll put in a fuel comfortable with it obviously have the to bill pass to choose from but overwhelmingly andoften a really good answer always like having a debt on my team to dump the cannon back out of Team fights if they can and finds a blank you have always tried Mark II Canon where's the teleport coming from where is the cannon actually trying to engaged and you just sold them right back out of the team fight so that's a direct answer right there for number one to your point about Karma she can build support and still it's a queer things to clear back wave if she takes minion dematerializer and spend them that way that's what I was doing a bunch in LPL and it is going to be the Zoe though most of support, At Your Service okay well push and roll pushing room that's the Zoe motto and that's going to work here for you well has put one game on two but it's going to work or Jana going to be heretypically say that feels good for Zoe but where am I going to be on another team fight May split is a pure tank yes someday can lock people down and bring donuts he has to contract to get and now I'm a little bit of damage but pure Frontline ER this is actually cute this Lexie or of course that can play support and more comfortable probably not to put the kennet yeah it is it definitely does better for that matchup and the set set it a whole nother Champion simply because of the existence of hexfly if not for the existence of that rude then we would not see a pic it in that role at all because so much of it comes from having your nipples cloaks speed after your your head flashing going for those constant threat of engages out of the project no jumping over walls in it and using your cues be on top of it and that really opens up more doors for him I definitely like itas far as you can really threatened for those Paul ince so, top comes through for hanser being Champion unique Champion number 10 across his game so far that's going to be excited to watch how that could use to one full but I like it I think looks really good we'll see how well they can do with a stamp overall and texture it does mean that set is there only hard engage on the line up Zoe can do a little bit with the Pope but it's often hard to make that completely work you know, one be 5:00 when there is counterpunch available to the other Squad rightly cynical and the key when you go over and then follow you go for a quick flash that's difficult but possible in some of the watch for He Is We are on a trip for our last game of The Weeknd golden Guardians only one game above hundred thieves right now if they win their up and sell it to game with the two head-to-head making it very easy to stay in the upper bracket part of the playoffsonly catches app will still get the Flash and are you kidding me you're not killing to finally first what I mean who he flashed to try and get this done there but I didn't quite have the exact angle so it didn't get them and they end up having it burn more Summoners they still get to kill do freak so so rewarded money onto closer on to the Olaf at the cost of The Flash from Olaf there's no way that you can really punish Olaf early though just as yams in especially with the first blood so every time you're very happy to trade your flash like that off despite his way out of any sort of situation that's not a one.all right well Red Bluff start of the one side hauntzer going to lie should you leave about two seconds for the by the way thank you and leave is too much are the Cavs going to go through this or do you know whose it is the TSM Jungle of leashes here is yeah we're going to take another look at another face jack off to get through on the other side to bring in for the stud that's why the flashing over that acts does mr. Wait till he sees that he misses the ACT then has to commit the flash I finally gets the third one to advise if that last Axe by going 90 degrees north and just guessing correctly killed by to flip like it was so close to not getting that kill yeah you can consider in this life for food if they check that one and then have to turn you away but also means no pressure by the way one spell exactly and you don't get even give the help back to your bit later like we're soap and seeing a lot of the farts been doing booty tho immediately able to fish around and they do see even that workplace so early I think it will be known you have an option for Lane ganking you can slip in there no extra Cypress towards obvious it's really important because of the fact that a flash list bar does a really easy gang Target and that means that who he playing that brush Rec Splash or clothes or sign up for a gank from that side of the map would be really really deadly so clear through all the clubs at 3:05 obviously with the extra-long sore in crease of the spell damage Rafi Autotech damage play a fast clearing there currently up to cancel the contract who's going through tough schedule we'll see if that plays out in the public stressful to go to be able to keep up with your query there so maybe looks for a top lamp play Fly floor plastic pots or something like that hospital immediately walks down to check Scuttle crab as closer alerts and hey I'm trading these topside is already taken by contracts so now on so I can play a little bit safer in the kind of match up with some days got the mini wave in a very nice spot though I might even be denying a decent amount, trying to throw out to use to just yes nobody calls come through double longsword plus blue Smite closer is very powerful in the jungle Hunter doesn't play a fair bit up but some people have a hard time letting crowd control on the karma as you can play pretty far away enough to walk up to get some nice hot cocoa in the back line that's going to be who he finding a stunt clutch comes through as well that was painful to Ruthven place to stay alive the Q is going to land on minions happy I cannot get any more follow-through and goes and eat some nice hot chocolate yeah pretty good a heel on the are eggs a side there for himself someday just say yes in a way here versus hanser the small Advantage for hot sore but since the minion wave he's on Sunday side going to start to build up a little bit year their reinforcements arrive quicker no harm no foul pretty good defensive War gear for Hunter and Carmen barely slippery hard to gank unless someday can get close enough Land one of those QC flashing With Yuri try and give your mini stuff to set up gangsta 3 vs 2 good luck getting away TVs coming in on both sides to show up if I can look like now something's going to land on a wine hunt Laporte pick a lock with a turtle live but now it is ever a time to go for Drake it's now your entire spots right here yeah so there's two choices to Golden Gardens need to do the resources I need to have a rotation to send somebody up to get the top way so you can already see on the mini-map Ryoma pushes mid-wave then heads up top waves Prime push that to you can try and stay one rotation ahead of your opponents and I'll just have all pawn to reset someday take over the mid-wave this is just more efficient use of your cell Elena since both of them were able to transition and they can still pick up the extra meaning waves in exchange. Golden Guardians happy to pay for that Dragon it with the gold of these many waves are going to lose like 1 melee the Canon minion waves going to soak the rest of them and Hunters are already here yeah that's the downside is technically the way. Had a cannon to the push was slow and it made it was pretty easy for Uncle to show up in time without losing too much gold he's comfy level six is there no problem in that side someday is actually the one who is a little bit hurting here is he's going to sit in Midland for a while receiving why I'm a walk down to that lane so someday we'll head back top but for now he's going to bleed a little bit of farm as the wave is slowly slowly dying contract level 5 time with Olaf your clothes and can't count and someday we'll eventually walk over to his land to get the rest of the gold in the Box a has to fight this fight will get sound but closer with the bubble Emmys has nothing to be had those are shows up at level deficit makes it difficult some they can't get much more done to have to go to regular me to Monta no scrub Sunday though cuz it takes, a little bit while to build that one back up in your eyes back top light just at the arrival of those minions even though that teleport bottom was very painful and detrimental to add a pretty pretty low on CS as we go get least he's able to get back for the second wave on the bounce back nightwell spell book of course here for the car must stay in for the Canon as they switch out of the teleport to go for a night he took the first big play and now it's time to play for the one of the ones here and the first Pieces come through child feels really really good enanthate match up with Kenan is super comfortable to Monterrey steel closes that's my blubaugh sorry but that's the way it goes please send you the topside hanser play foot sound of a tether going to be sun. Leaf in his hear no read out for contract kill picked up just at the edge of that placing Maelstrom they catch him with a stun two versus one closer went in bottom side is trading currently valve no health bars close recipe a little bit respectful to take the ferry to damage down to 500hp should survive
