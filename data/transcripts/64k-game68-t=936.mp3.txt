looks like we're going to playoffs it'll happen as well of course if we are in a battle between Havelock playoffs for themselves if they win here today they lock it upper bracket start and theoretically ezzell Golden Girls can finish as high as second in the regular split they can get a playoff bye it's almost impossible to get to go their way but it's possible CLG or just one game above the bubble they are tied for Seven 8 with dignitas and Immortal just one game behind them take a playoff spot away as they have had such a bad run over the last number of weeks honestly so no seal G's performance it if it is indicative of anything of these last few weeks and he started for and to write in there now sitting 5 and 10 so that is a pretty rough streaking a one-win eight losses over those last nine gamesgolden Guardian on the other hand is fixing to i-83 over their last 11 so they are actually looking at you no pretty pretty darn good definitely not refuse me but it's going to be a tough match for feels itchy and if they want to make it to the playoffs at all they've got to start picking up some wins yeah I've been took to put it in a very kind of aggressive weight the last time seal G1 Dave's what's playing in the Top Lane and they beat Evil Geniuses who promptly signed gold lipstick Advent start oplinger like that was what happened the last time steals you want a game the other team made roster changes because of the fact that that happened overall to call the Guardians here looking at a winning record right now they have yet to finish and elsya split with a positive win rate and I say that because I think this is the first iteration that I think can do it today are on the road to do 4th 10 and 8 would be that tour life their favorite here again CLG who got set locked in already and I want to find a big thing that I think does whole world Blind Guardian of falias was Nerf gunin the last patch here in 10-15. A lot of things have finally stopped picking the champion and it's FBI's how to split Israel also you know it's not as popular on this page and those two combined for 10 of his games and so he is going to be relying on those pretty heavily or at least he has been in the past we'll see where he wants to move also take me to make that they can even hire a CEO do you for the remaining games at visit flyquest and seen I so this is probably the most winnable Dame as you said they are only one game up on those bottom two teams so they want to maintain control over their playoff spot this may be their best chance to do so golden Guardians obviously trying to get towards those upper bracket game try to picture of that for themselves and has been looking very good maybe going back to the Affiliates regardless it hasn't been that popular down to about 25% presents I believe you were saying earlier and hasn't been super effective in those games but obviously still can be a monster in the lake ininto the can be so if you guys going to be on that yet again three and one on the affair Leo's going to be his most winning champions who said for this little to get up it's locked in here is golden Guardians have the set that we have seen who he play we do if we go topless show me the closest place to eat near as well and Demonte on another champion that got nerfed dispatch Twisted Fate was also a spot to Mid laner and Pro Player of the previous patch. Nerves a lot of teams the Bandit Montego says nope this is still the song I want to place it to work for me the cooldown got increase on the W's do at your pic of car does a Vibe lyrics to Second longer cooldown it's barely relevant do at Max rank if it's going to be the same but you know you're not maxing that skill first so it's not going to be till 12:13 that you actually do have that equal to where it was in the past but if you don't think that you're going to be bullied around the early game if you feel he can still maintain the pressure I do think that having that Global style semi Global style is something that golden Guardians have been very effective within the past it has been Champion that hasn't really really good for Demonte they want a lot of games rarely on playing this will push style weather looking for back doors and making trades of objectives in 2 hours and I think it's funny that they're going to be pretty interesting to know that this is the reverse of the match of that they were playing with the marked and roll cloud 9 it was then actually playing at the FL EOS and it was a golden Guardians who took the coolest and were able to really push the pace and actually snowball vacuum to Victory against about 9 so we'll see if FBI can have a better better better time in that matchup in entrapped hold Downs Dixon smoothie you haven't been strong later to be fair they haven't been but of course I'm active looks favorite for that you're seeing a pinch band or not convinced that the Ford is for sure going to happen obviously even if he does have a question and you could usually reactively black shield the facebreaker and you're going to look pretty okay so I like to see LG Duo statistically Golden Gardens wind that length mass of flies look filled your favorite near going to see more. I could use a bit later in the TF it does have a lot of lame pressure theoretically you could just got to push in obvious you can sell black fuel door light to Black lyrics cold hearted and can try to keep the mate under turmeric with the w nursing laning phase Nerf it would make that much a Fetter as though as the champion recently bought unless that rise go stop waiting for ruin it can have at East Meadow Lane pressure and feel good against Amante TF tell me some of the outside Lane again later on if you are thinking Golden Gardens going to really heavily depend on playing Thailand to having a champion that Ken Stillwell Angel a Kinderkamack side lansinoh be pretty effective in matching robes as well with their awesome work obviously not as good as the destiny but still can be fairly powerful it should be that Morgana down to the bot Lane drafting board here a little bit so much pressure in that to be to who he has been a great lame player of this does feel like it's more about the roaming no failures I don't think we'll ever really going to go down with that set because usually only seat that before I can repair the long side sometimes it up a steak dinner but also at the cliffs. So they are going to go with the rain support hear themselves but I do think we are due also ship them nurse should be pretty heavily disadvantage against the more, and close ties for sure going to have more Lane strength than that the Paleo so we'll see how much CLG can get done cuz I do think they are very heavily favored in the Scooby-Doo and it's going to be up to Golden Guardians on Elite survive but for who you to try to get out of Lane and try to force that Morgana to match his room so that FBI can kind of just before me and out against 6 day and CLG say Okay more Frontline for Caroline pobelter in 6/8 of the damage when it comes to Mid and late game the new can I was up in the top five they do with the match of was Ruth a pygmy maokai I'm ready to play tanks out of this one course or it was nervous patches while baby says this is now my CO2 tank either way this is going to be right here no more flop season things going to be coz looking favorite of the duo pobelter going to be an incredibly strong the late game damage Mage on the rise very curious to see how his matches going to go against the Monte if cleanse doesn't show up for the TF of course Rises pretty good gig setup might see Wiggly show up down there as well on the Boulevard and a very big Frontline right you got heavy tanks in the one side where is not quite so much that is pretty good over there on the jungle but it's not good email kaiv Boulevard and so Golden Gardens less with front line against the healthiest foods to fight do you think the milk I was honestly a great pic here it's it's my favorite tank into Kenan I do think that you can withstand that much of a very well and especially because you have another AP mid laner yes that is is damaging physical damage but he's giving building tank if it's a t f and a Canon so you can very comfortably Bill towards you know early Spirit message or at the very least you know a cow into a Sunfire you could hold up well in the sidelines Malachi has these waves lyrics if you do go for that Sunfire route and that the discussed snap go button is pretty powerful just flashed with Advanced be there very many squishy members over on the golden Guardian side so I think they're going to have a good time and you in those seems like I can also even be pretty difficult for Canon to actually find those engaged because even if tenant find the flank or a good angle to get two words that back line now if I can just say no lock you down with a Twist event into an ultimate into that huge knock you back even more so yeah they're still owe a lot of reasons why I really like this guy pic and I-10. field you pretty heavily if it comes down to keep fighting unless there is amazing and an ultimate but golden Guardians is going to want to be playing side blades still spreading the map out a utilizing Barton TF at the try to find these plays inside lanes and engages where are sealed she isn't quite ready for it and that's one thing we talked about a few weeks back when interviewing and asking you know hey what's your place. What's it look like for you and yeah you know we feel like we have kind of settled in on a play style we figured ourselves that we know what we want to do and it's a lot of this a lot of playing around the map and being one of those rotation heavy split push Focus teams in the league and so often I feel like we see a middle-of-the-pack or lower to your team and we're like all right look just refer team fight grab them Alki grab a nautilus Skyler filios go hit them v e v you know cuz you don't trust everything else golden Guardians have honestly has I would say is their best split ever so far as it to the others are getting better year of a year and it's it's but time and again they're going through these kinds of Champions they're playing more their own style they're they're doing their own little bit level of innovation and is it cool to see if it is working but it really isn't it interesting when you're talking about having the best butt ever I agree and it didn't even feels like it's even more like that this is our highest level ever when you consider how good they've been over the last number weeks because they started out one in for you know this was not a thing that came out of the gate so they are now sitting at 87th Ave been very good over the last to know about 5 weeks 4 weeks or so so I can be very happy about that it's also interesting to know that not only did who he start the wi for that you'll Shrine every time we've been seeing that people have actually been going to still lanes and dropping them there in this case they're kind of just having a bit of a nod towards their weak laning phase in this to V2 he actually started the W but dropped all of those help friends down in the bottom Lane in case they are getting pushed in case there are poked out they're going to have that they're going to have cleanses wild orange shield on that B I do very defensive set up the exhaust even on the bar which is pretty a typical so I do think that this is some pretty smart adjustment given that they are expected to to have trouble in this to be too early lead to push into food will get more Farm overall and actually just be some damage wisdom on Tazewell check through his potion Moser wedding around admit in case there is a game that have all of our for usually passed through May they're going to find some damage but certainly nothing like a gold card for a stunt both will be easily under threat and have no problems here will beat any small farm Leaf evolve Haunter putting it on the top side went through a cold start switch in a bun B one I'll be there was no risk at all you're never going to die 2 amount Hendersons really really miss play fun we had together so far though so good for Haunter pushing the wave has a small family and actually really like that closer just ran through laying there and he made the read that we lie was playing too that topside and since they had to push with wants her up on that top side you know that would always be a schedule that you would be able to get if they try to challenge me help them on tape you have to push up Midland you have to push you off so you could have caught you take the hospital and then he can Retreat down toward this bottoms go to the opposite side of the map from where weekly is and by doing this you guaranteed himself both schedules on this first rotation and that is going to be feeling very very good weekly can try to look for some sort of the gang Ciara but the Monte is playing at pretty far back is on so it doesn't look like there's going to be any opportunity to get something back here for Whately time of the day nothing really done but a 5c asleep or both are as the first three calls come through in the midline OR checking on botkier is well where there's a a Farley for FBI who he was taking you know the week or early later in a Paleo safe I guess. Counterpick on support technically but I still feel like I save him work on a slightly as you can with black shield off all your self regardless though as the wave is going to push back around you spoke at the farm lead on the afelio so you should have no problem getting to choose when the recall comes in the only way that would stop if it said you know we would rather play for Drake instead will it will break damage so far that's not the case once again is the second Bloom we have now seen spot Woodley clearing his jungle there's really no chance in the folder to be surprising in the fact that they were kind of has been on the back foot in this that double pedal went to closer in the Guardians x 1/2 bushing fat lady even taken a turn plate this early on which I do mind fairly surprising and a given that you know Morgana plus this Calista are pretty drawing there are you Kathy pole vaulter was looking for the entire group and not quite able to get it you do you have planned to eat for uwt actually have that via Route now it is otherwise just a slow I thought I was he hasn't paid for quite some time so Demonte has that window the lamp is gold card before kobalter could actually get that route set up for weekly attention if you're always able to go with gold card has locked that means mate can always be safe and I spoke flashes in or something you know more than listen to press the button really hard here I'm sure there's a reason why I've been watching the lane entirely in the mouth but felt like with blankets are they had if they want to take them back and forth I think they could have as well and it you know that it's just the gas but not in my mind if I'm playing afelio sand in the coolest in a plane gets Calista and we're both just AFK farming and no one has idubbbz I'm actually really happy at the FL Leos so maybe he felt like if I staying in Lane he would deny the base timing of his opponent and just keep them both on these these small items you know this is going to be stronger on earlier items so maybe just felt like a we just people walked in laying here we just continue this passive no item farming out style I try to delay a little bit more waves and then do the 7-minute Recon said this should allow unless he's inspiration secondary if it allows boots and things like this it'll be a bigger power spikes I'm curious what else he wants to pick up here certainly actually say something
