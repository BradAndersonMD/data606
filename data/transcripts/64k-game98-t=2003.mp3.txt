I hear the combination of the split with the championship qualifier today right into Champion Select excited to see where the priorities are really going to lies and pick them up and see if people are talking a lot about the Midland matchup but you know sometimes if you're focusing too much on one match up that can be at the expense of others and you talked about how solo was dominant over Kumo in their previous series when I get them. Then a lot of people to talk in a bag at the potential wind conditions in the late game do because he has his do solid throughout the entire year but that's far you know there are some of those keep being removed we can save her calling taken away for ignorant people really highlighting his playmaking ability he had gone back to come the more grip fix things like Blitz and pipes still available if you were to go to war with them or, I think is the most obvious to others by making sports that you can go to without having to think about while your parents are playingfor the AC in the cloud has ever taken off the table thing to do move around I think that was a good match of the day we still have the AC if they actually want to place where the bottom side of the map I do think VPN to foreign can be quite solid I think solo DP is France's best previous track did you say some more standard pick that is going to be what they will go to war with Kendall has been a strong performer on this year to scrapping you fellows for a wild turtle that has been Marksman but it is going to be an aggressive response here from EG Civic review on with Calista Tarik really strong pairing you can't utilize Kik Alyssa alternate Dubai time for a chair to getdon't alter it off beatin off the use it more aggressively obviously throwing in the tereck instead of the batch is done and that can be a very good pairing and is that immunity allows Calissa I would say the wherewithal to stack up with Spears and try to look to get aggressive in its worth play here for Flight Support either way for those you on ESPN heading to hook commercial brick online station stop tryna locked in here against the orange that is going to be really strong and when it comes to the team fighting stage we don't know obviously what the jungle choice is going to be here for EG I'm expecting that can already been. So within could be another one to get banned out here I do think it's it's been scaring probably has been Champion historically over the last couple years and can be pretty strong level priority in those early games but pretty well for that v e v off in Orange is bitter that kind of tea by feet think of becoming extremely difficult to actually hope down but what difference does it make, more of a tank and self and also does how to shred through that oorn zodiac to going to be the van here though so worried about some of these kind of the LeBlanc the Zoe both taken away those are some of the more economically dominant pick he does have a lot of those pics that are more Side Lane when you think about the rise when you think about the echo champions like this so we could still see EG go towards arrived but has less worried about the scaling pick and they're the kind of side lamp place and they are about to go meet me pressure in that early game and it is going to be blitzed so this is really exciting ignore again could be willing to go towards those Playmakers okay so aggressive support option is there resolve Mark Z with the beautiful Ms paint drawings I just got the blinds are Midland they're going to answer with Kindred off the table and I actually like that as a combo because the speed up and the rez you can throw a bomb on or off had you can see them up sending it to the back line to read gives you I think more viability to go later into the game billion as a picture I think this was just a nod's as back of our people does have counter a great to be another aggressive option here this does give you more damage or the Laker game because when you are playing it was Gillian and warn your consistent damage to be fairly low in the later stages the games that's been scared he is going to go with another Marksman option this is a good matchup against the trundle you can use your data go over top of that how to build a kite out the trundle and sometimes even use the filler again this is a power farmer very much does deal like a 525 South of the terror for the ultimate you have the support of time and I'll be to your front-line there of corn do a lot of Frontline a building of fighting ability with the humerus and actually taken down as Victor for power of evil so I have priority against the Sicilian but he gets enough levels do you get to a point where if you have enough that I think relatively new to borrow against harm you all right well wave clear Midland power going to be in there for power of evil is going to be fun to watch for with rates of course it has been a lower when Drake overall for him tobacco store ESPN. We are heading into the game start very very soon Champs have been locked in Peewee is on his signature pick in the Victor was actually pretty winning one for him if you if you look back in history is actually one of his lowest when are Champion that he plays a lot of I noticed I was up for example not opting into that one is a bit more comfortable and not only winning but more commonly pick for him but says okay Victor is a kind of style we want here I definitely see how the Marksman jungle pick comes through here because fence currently not been playing Champions like that he had one Kindred game is dorkly on the season so far no Bridge games of course Chris has to pick up couple of Puffs over time and go to see a kind of pressure face in the lineup why doesn't answer to the opposing jungler it was picked in the answer to the opposing top laner right was picked in the answer to the orange and scaring the ability to actually go for a matchup that he can abused in that jungle won't be one and the marks are really good at doing that cater is really good at doing it at Grace is really good at doing that you can out for him that trundle on the greys you can get in his face and I'll do a limb if you have the Red Bluff and and kite him out to use the quick try to get behind the pillar and actually use that against that trundle so I think it's a very exciting pick pairs well with the lower damage profile of the zillion in the Orion to should be really exciting game 1 yeah you don't have the easiest Armour stocking on the flak westside of course right because you're looking at the fact that okay A Truck Stop is it really want to buy a ton of armor when he's currently having to face against oranges or magic damage 5e you know you're not going to rush an armed guard on Victor really in general very much over all others you may have a decent chance to do it but even if your damage is primarily Marksman heaviness very physical heavy metal may still be enough to kind of keep up is because the reason that super durable Frontline that's still a lot of tools here on the flag beside of course right it can look really really good with blitzcrank roll around in the Middle Lane zillion don't have the best escape tools overall and and you never really really might see a lot of pressure down there right now and don't flash seats we can't get away from Bozeman to easily calculate from The Flash punch up either and the tropical I set that up as well so I can kind of see Midland pressure working really really well for flyquest even even the to be too it's actually really scary for terok because people think of tarek as a group of men with a Braum's in the Nautilus and whatever but are generally is building pretty squishy you're going for things like Redemption early on you know you often do not play Aftershock because it's harder to hit that Dazzle so you are actually fairly acceptable to just hooking in that tarek and actually just the focusing him down in that to be too so I do think that there is the ability not only for them to bring the same pouring down with a pillar setup a hook but you converge on at midlane is as marks he was kind of wanting out of flyquest if you show up with the trundle you pillar in the zillion slowing down that that's a pretty easy hook to at least work out of flash there from zucchetto do you think that largely this game will depend on the Play Making of ignoring I think that's kind of just how blitzcrank works if you are ahead if you were dominating Vision you can make as Champion look incredible and if you are behind and they see you coming every time this Champion looks like garbage compared to something like tarek yep going to be a while before I'll be having my eyes on the core stop playing as well we saw solo absolutely dominate Kumo in his to earlier or and games when they when they last played a couple weeks ago I was thinking more of the same so I am very curious exactly where the pressure does come down because like most has the Jets are really aggressive got any of those three lines that will be fun to watch for do you want to point out the 4th of you wondering why you're still see their faces and not gameplay just yet would you have to build up a gameplay paw perfect pet of Integrity that is almost done soon we had a bit of a slow start to the game for some Chuck listening issues but I will be ready to get into that game yet again and I want to sort of talked about some more of the EEG side of things then as we are going to first welcome to summoner's Rift everybody has a loser takes third-place winner faces Cloud 9 in the LCS 2020 ring fine and we're going to see in this game starts out better in this series of the five games for going to figure out who takes at least talk to a lot of starting out better in this playoff series is going to be about them boats election because I saw them popping some of votes so if you're going to be good with you most you have to have the right choices you have to have you know maybe the the surprise crab in there you know maybe the little popcorn eating amoeba know some of those ones are pretty good the monkeys are always a favorite band early in base here with a superintendent of a I really like because it does threaten a potential invade and asked if you wanted to give that experience to okay that's why they were delaying so much is going to expire because giving that to the zoo K would mean he would get to level 2 on that first wave that one minute earlier can make a pretty big difference sometimes in those mid lane matchups but a couple of really interesting things to point out already so I talked about kind of the preferential matchup of Grey's this Markman into trundle he's going to phase rush to to even further extend that because this makes it so that trundle really doesn't even have that pillar slow you know the pillar is not going to hold Grace and because he can't go over it but now you have phase rush to actually remove that slow and build the kite back and forth very effectively against that trundle which makes it even more difficult than just okay is also playing close by so this is going to be Super Soaker spooky ghosts going to be about the slowdowns not only does this setup for things like The Dazzle Sun from the tereck obviously makes it very easy to land a double bombs effective against heavy beams and we see that there are three millichamp compact is later on in the game and you'll play it more for the control which is really really powerful yeah and he telegraphs you put in general not only with just be glp out of the zoo kazillion but also even knowing for Azazel that he needs to pop his old lady in Mister into kind of re-engage anything really really impact really helpful because a lot of these things do want some set up where to build sometime and vacuuming for the nice early pushes going Kumo way she wasn't the truth that I should not it's a little Lots Farm giving someone a tap solo. A little bit greedy trying to see us everyone instead of 6 setting that he was going to miss some of those and prepping the next like sometimes you just have to make a choice that no I can't get this and you just give that minion allowed to Die 2 The Traveler prepping the other minions to get them in a position where the snakes but not too big of a deal with early on not going to be that big of a difference but Telegraph place the glacial augment can be very powerful and something that people don't always talk about that much now with the spooky ghost is actually how effective it is to help you work Friday allows you to actually scout out areas your tutu find out if they are camping in a brush but you can pop that active then your Tuesday so that is clear you can move in and it really does help to allow you to secure some more state vision all right we'll take a quick look around the map at how the Earth Elaine's have gone since we're going to get scuffs cuddle he went to the Evil Geniuses side with Graves and Co down their bottle and pretty clothes and farm Phillips. Back down again with Synthroid and Tow in case there is a gank but it looks like it's still going to be Kubo early on Mid fairly close to jump out to Camp so a fairly mundane early game with Jeff and be a fun surprise with Kumail doing well does match up very early on both teams have going on in the early levels that was because he was going to be clearing forests bought situations where you know your jugular is not going to be topside you actually want to bounce the Waverly so that it pushes back towards you while the enemy jungler is up there that is because the way people did not be put towards you can basically just get your turret be safe from any potential ganks and still know that you will have that farm coming in that you can collect that gold next. Safely on your side of the map get an all was well for him honestly, having a decent starter Leon will see if that changes around one of the things that solo.
