I'm from elimination and they ran it all the way to the finals which day one fanatic here though speaking of winning the first match up with TSM and it was largely off the back of self-made Zebulon a lot of people scrutinizing that getting through the Bandit does not this time around I think there's a lot more conscious time you are on the right side are you going to give up the Gangplank van or the threat band now because both of those are very highly prized Champion they decide to keep the hello thing pressure down with ease games like in the reason why is bantel often is because he has held a 69% win rate me more that he is over his entire career with his Champion fnatic is one of the teams that loves making crossmap plays do use ultimate from the topside to backup self-made in any of those bottom side of the map indicates that they go forhow to make dragon play all right so brave Premiere jungle pick up Kyle Whipple to play a match, stop playing her name is Ali met him in a bit later and you still got the damage that right you can't just a cat Mar or armor because you decide to come through we are going to get the most prized junglers at Worlds this year in Italy is I believe the number one most prized Champion as a speaker I love playing The Office Encino Evolve game for 25 minutes has gotten better since and we continued PSM style of playing through Top Lane Broken Blade on the Camille she has been an absolutely huge Paw Patrol on both sides break honestly to the the Camille pick up here is just barely Bowl because they haven't thrown any Top Lane bands that only the only one that could be considered as being taken awayMatt Poole Ave Louisville into the commuter lots of options for fanatic and they could go either way do you want to go team fighting with a horn style do you want to take it with these Phil match up with Broken Blade and have that fight at that's what everybody wants to see with o versus Broken Blade throwing down with Carrie fan played in that lane regardless Santa comes to your right away here for reckless his most played at the split double of second most Gyros while I'm. If we going to see TSM Rush pick a priority to Portland like a Bard down here for biofrost I can help keep them pretty safe as well give it seems to be gauged ears will come through or if you need to contact Oregon Like A syndrome surprised at all for fanatic multiple times that is the one for to beat a man carry for this team so more support of 80 karrie they are brings healing to the graves and they finally did get there and hear their graves Victory is different so excited aboutsocial media that was that was definitely kind of a benchmark for that even though his previous great beings have been so in a well-executed by him let's take a look though the galio Camille combination this is one where you can make picked around the map you can also backup your jugular the analysts I thought I had a really nice judgment on how galio is is about an extra backup for your jungler we used to have previous memes of of different iterations at world where mid laners would have junglers as the third Summoner spell and the tables have turned my friend when you walk in galle out now and we get to go put those dresses aggressive invades probably towards the top side towards the Camille and you have galya off the back you up give you that confidence to go for the all in and it's time to start coming through and it's a real Shield there aren't goodwhite starters and let's workout split push the Camille which there are pics that can do at such as Jack's Renekton you can see the more prize band right here I do want to see if we go to find another and get Champions like maybe about 5 if a duty ball to Hillsong on YouTube say a Bard or an Alistair or rakan or what the plan actually look like earlier the voluntary probably most likely for the side of fanatic right now but we are hoping for a little bit of spies we know that it's definitely has extra tricks that they have practice for pain comes through here no more reckon available Bal cross will not get to pick that one up first PSN to have their pick of the litter though they could go something like a Leona and just go really hard on the ticker for hard engage honestly that just gives you so many Tools Plus taking away where the possibilities of heart engagement from Fanaticsfootball championship this is a good one for if you have a lot of things going to land on your whole Squad wants to Die 2 player she is but I think she's fine wine and knock them down and refuses to dodge all the scent of still shots and what not and we're going to get it expensive to support beer out of Hill House on as he can do it this game every game that's fine we need to throw Spiced Right now like we said our advantage p.m. coming into this no sitting up there at the top of the group tied with the rest of the members of TSM are the ones that are in a must-win situationI kind of hate for the heart engaged part they are going back to the types of propositions that did really get them here they're looking for aggressive place they want to be the aggressors they want to be the one forcing these decisions on fanatic fanatic they'll have gotten some very nice mattress for them self Whipple I think will be a very comfortable on this volibear Nemesis has actually stepped up a lot for this team I think that's one of the areas that people were initially looking at for fanatic being a little bit worried coming in and summer but he had performed really well so far at world and it's going to be about where will self-made go Ken he hard carryall right quick fist bump what your ranking system for a 450 wants to go with stars or thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up for me sightings it is a incredible Battle Gear fanatic have only sale getting out of group at World once back in 2014 which was 185 Samsung white and it was the Travis beef in the quarter-final Fanatics have Time and Time and Time and Time Again Play excellently their last two World Championships were only cut short by the world champion but not a year over year over year with roster changes caps went to G2 rocks went to pee liquid and if continued to beon the rear fan Fanatic in 2020 or yet another version of this once again fact of the LSU final once again tied for first place now in the group Boyz pick it out here tsf it's a 03 stock for them have already been eliminated on that 3in pre-record TSM win every game today to make an atopic fanatic they still got Genji and LGBT but we will get ourselves out of the rift for the first game of the day and there's going to be at least 10 game has so much going for right now freak so much extra pressure here because as much as Citizens backs are against the wall and it's a must-win game for them fanatic also really really really want that first CD coming out of the group that gives you so much more momentum moving on through the tournament and considering the way the department is organized dodging the first he's from the other group will give you such a bigchant at moving deep into the tournament or no to the first bead spell far soon in order and we've already seen that someone will they only went 5 in 1 pop group b as well as those the teams that you would Dodge by getting first place in this group and if possible could get a first as I would probably asphyxiate yourself and exciting battle PSN fighting for survival fanatic fighting for topping the group here to in 1 vs 0 and 3 last time these two teams fought it was closed but fanatic made better place throughout the game and came away with the victory navigate to watch a rematch alright level one here from fanatic going pretty well if they do get the Jeep were down for themselves I do want to highlight the jungle matchups pacifically for these two teams speaker has been just what TSM needed in the jungle rookie player hasbeen outstanding for them meanwhile he's going up against a star player in self-made was been front-and-center leading fanatic to Victory after Victory and I actually think that it deserves a little bit of a deeper dive here while we don't have any action we also don't have any sweeper is going on so probably no no Laden vase and we can we can go into a deeper discussion on how the jungle meta a rose and why we're seeing so much of these Tower clears of of grazed in Italy yeah because it's it comes down to kind of Jungle Theory at his most basic at the same time is money is especially true for jugulars breed junglers you have to travel to your camps to your objectives and make these choices so efficiency is your highest priority and you're constantly being judged on that the best dunkin the world they'll create advantages for themselves both by increasing their own efficiencies in these Ways by playing a pass for the camps for their objective and reducing their opponents possible options that is through counter jungling and controlling the vision because if you counter jungle one of these camps with both of them are currently playing their own side cramps and and you do it without the opponent being aware that they don't get a chance to alter their path and make up for that lost time I think the biggest fallacy I've seen some of the weaker junglers fall into his ex best travel time and losing out that way because if you try to explain the rise of of Grey's Anatomy of the power clear is in in later terms it's kind of like if I give you the option for increasing your your minions spawn time to every 20 seconds set up every 30 seconds sounds good actually get to do and these Champion are able to utilize the pressure of their lanersgo then create those opportunities and take them away from their opponents looking after the full clear level four doubles afraid I'd say about forty seconds ago TSM sussing out a likely full clear and end of the day it is going to be a 1 Camp difference right now to do bottom Scuttle should be a formality there for the middle leave it has left upper Rock through her so far Through the Jungle to be a pretty easy climbing we're back at 6 to 6 self-made walking through and so it'll be easy for us to know this happening and he will tight back 5 CS bleed right now for Nemesis with four left the farm Jarrettsville get close to this Mark but it looks like you're looking at the beach travel time for these junglers not wasting any for each of them both of them getting off the phone clear splitting Scuttle crab this is kind of what you expect when you have fairly decently even lanes and a graves in Italy match up they get to choose their optionsthere's no heart submit from a a grave newly seeing each other it's it's usually I stare down unless one of them has a big brush advantage of small chance for some fresh from the topside Brooklet had a drink at world that would see if there was a grave gank but the waves in front of his grip bo4 getting a pretty early recall off teleport list and getting to doran's items you can CBD help are still getting worn down Broken Blade low on man with a biscuit to give me another rotation to spell but we're fo overall up and farm catching up now level 5 as well Brooklyn might have a pretty hard time believing him any further in this Lane and this is one of the reasons why we just expected of Olives are right really good trading power here building up a slow push on a minion wave is an opportunity also to call your jugular I trade in a minion wave is going to push poop go back this is an opportunity that's plenty of minions to try and keep in front of your Tower trying to knock some of these minion to Pueblo and get a little bit back here will probably see the teleport come out from Guapo only now have to worry about Middle Eastlistening because the jungles have been powered clearing there hasn't been any of that extra intelligence-gathering and the extra information and he's going to have to be very careful with his Warden which you can see on the mini-map places that control board and the drink Awards so even if Natalie Haupt over the back of that Daron Pitts would be seen by the control board and has a drink of water can try brush whippo covering all bases nothing. Weiner to your notice a big play in the bottom so I want to see coming back and forth we're going to be okay now file Frost is going to be starting now as all the durability drops off it'll take some decent damage and of the day though she'll comes up for his safe and self-made right in front of speaker is greatly reduced Drake information not gathered Goods sneakers play self-made first Drake diplomatic as well yep self-made Dragon right there is able to do it all himself gets right in the back there a speaker has been waiting very patiently for another aggressive move but the big minion wave pushing away from
