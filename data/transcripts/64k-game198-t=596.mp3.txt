the long time to see if they're over G2 and as we saw G to meet the pretty handily but there could have standing against Cloud 9 we will see you later today that's the battle for me it's really important here in and I want to see them convincing / h k h set it up for us pretty well here you make me hit the emergency in that match against YouTube what are the things that worked so well for them in the lck summer didn't actually go there I think underperformed especially in that really came out to dry as well I want to see him back on some confidence come up with a much stronger performance because a lot of people had him pegged the house is on fire for Griffin after losing to do to if they also lose to Hong Kong attitude but if they are able to write the chip and have a convincing Victory I thinktext the group stage would be much better for Griffin because this team is second in the rectum and never placed below second in the playoffs of lpk stir it ever won the title they lost the best season 3 of each time but they are for sale for 3 Split don't they are the second best team in Korea as far as I can tell he was so we'll see what they could do one of this one a scam for Thursday through the elements had a fairly easy play and run and a very tight game against power down yesterday so we can definitely see them and they're already opening with a lot of power here the singer that we solved in Flex between Mission and unified in that plane State as well as I call you that can move around a big deal for in the plants was putting 3z on something that was powerful getting mission to The Landing phase been through a lot of these different lines here and now they have some the Champions to be able to do itI think it's why to get show be back on that are really achy is Dairy Queen on that champion if the rest of the game around him is still going right I'd like the lease in as well and the wrecks I pretty much I think would Hong Kong out if you have to walk in here otherwise it would get banned outfit to I think the right size of a good answer here into the least in regardless I want crack on a jungle that can have a heavy early game impact for his Lanes the wreck site is going to be it and now I just want to see how France Works alongside its lanes because he had up-and-downs working with those players throughout his tenure here on Hong Kong added where does the sender go because I think Stinger plus wreck site is in almost unbeatable to be toliquid comes through here right now hkt's physical damage done working their lineup unified and expecting any Marksman out of him but we'll see what does come through the union still left up what it's worth the Aaron you become good come through and I actually like Tao Hong Kong attitude waited until Phase 2 to lock it in last game but first phase wristband by gryffin I think make the Gathering you be less threatening because even though the guarantee we can do this massive beat Wall Frontline to can push people around the map without also having some sustained damage the execution complexity of a chain composition raises a fair bit so I think that this is less about taking that sort of stealing often and more about looking for early game Firepower is it the threat Away by Griffin is it going to be something else that can pack quite a punch in the TVThe Marksman band swing out of hk8 is there more they're afraid of I will say viper give an interview recently that said he wanted to prove that you can play other stuff in the bot Lane it already in 2018 as one of the most Innovative lot of weight after patch 811 that kind of temporary relief through the pro game into upheaval so I don't think he have to pick her right now and I think is also keeping the options open to do something different cigarette is a devastating but looks like and you look at scary New Orleans the first name Mitchell krk shift and get you a wavy Leona or away from the central time and makes me think this heart then want to play horse the top side of map again in this gameyou know they could put your Elliott are they have the option to take another day or so later and regular season and it's obviously but is speculation that start with sub down in the regular season because of performance and champions will do much of their game against aside from the fact when he died she be back until he can he still ended with the Hyatt CSD f-15e other player that it did work to put chocolate it's about what do they do not get in that I really like this year with a Scion because of course you lose the landing phase against can take quite a beating in that toppling and then offer some pretty good game assistant especially when level six does come around he can either go for a kills inside of the length scale of 1 to be a super taking monster or use that to runI see what you're saying as far as the heart engage ability of all of them and I think that's absolutely would be concerned about him being a pinata of goal for a touch of that Jace because that is why we stopped seeing toppling tanks all right is going to play the Midway it is very impressive to 122 hope they can pop the center I actually love this now makes me think they actually want to play outside the map cuz you have all that's all in threat maybe just be stored on an island use the kleptomancy get your money because bottling in early levels that you can jump on your phone app on it Griffin one of the most exciting teams to come out of South Korea kept missing World shot at Redemption right now HK their respect the Invaders what is given as a Scion at level 1 just going in there total disaster for gripping a level one more time I mean cracks he's been coming for so long and they predicted this play to come in Blue Hens going to the dive and then absolutely Steelers you just don't do that Blake Griffin does it anyways just so eager to try and get Tarzan some type of early game Advantage they just as you say give up kills to Sion sintra Henley on it and now this you know makes the early game so much more explosive because both of our junglers held on to their flashes UCI missing flapper Toby the Midland on the Azrael maybe a little bit harder to punished but a flash list down bottom side on the naughty list all the sudden it's a lot harder French go forward when there's a lien on the other side both of these teams have the assistance to get there jungles involve down bot Grace Elizabeth missing classes are matched perfectly by the opposing sides with these are volatile to be clear it's in his Harley Flat supports so we'll see what does come through and then sleep for Tarzan was only a spitz to your for crash that he's not incredibly ripped he's going to like instantly complete Warrior so a fairly equal jungle presence here and I actually think that it's not a music going to mean that the early game is incredibly explosive in fact it might end up being the opposite so part of the game plan for Griffin we thought was going to be playing around a top Lee Jace I think I have to pull over with the killing to assist going to spy on his armor stacking may actually prevent stored from being able to get that power how about l212 in this River craft pushed away Landoll Ripper crash was passing down towards that side of the map to who stars in needed to make that play happen otherwise his bottling to be too has to give up all control on top of the two pills they get it's also the added safety for this bottling over Aurelia and our list that goes want to be playing a little bit more aggressively in those engages and just leave it behind in this fight so yes Tarzan goes in but the accuracy of the W shift and then right there red opal Mystic shot there by chovy showing off his mechanics and then they have double Red Bluff has no chance of Escape have to call out because he used to Tunnel forward without middling priority and then he also has to try and clear away award in that he didn't really have the CC he didn't have the escape tools either to try to run away from that fight when it was very obvious Toby was going to be the first one there ready to go for the TV 2 I take a breather check out what this kid looks like right now is I'll be there early lead in early and speaking of early earliest First Blood since 2015 tracking in world history Sol Griffin still badly he wanted to kill see how the game goes cuz that's so far Pretty Fly for a minute and one minute I think the average is going down here for a minute livable goes crazy off of that kill now has completed Sheen up against just the cloth armor there from Mission this is already give you a really good matchup for Cioppino that you deflect wiper what's the irelia to Viper in that bottom line so they could have disarranged advantage in quartz Midland you can already see it building up that's out NCS for Toby and with that more powerful first base of the scene as opposed to something like this year he should be able to harass a lot more because he's playing as a melee Champion it means a landing W's through the prepaid and then stepping up to prop the auto attack is a lot more viable and usually never get to pull that off and Bottom by 3 I got this is more power in his yeah I heard a lot about the back to come to the bottom as well to recharge yeah that was a play that Viper really wanted to make but the fact that crash was there for the counter tank and it was not necessarily extinct metis ended up just dying by going into early enough to retreat it's always going to be a struggle playing these double Mala Fama you mean all the time whenever you go for the altland there's no real Escape there's no running away from it because you do go into melee ranged New York damage here so as lanzino Viper Jovan in Viper was always going to be hung out to dry without minions to try to retreat onto with his que ya and the Drake is going to be set up next but I got a question and you're free why does 3D have a dagger Scion coming in maybe maybe I have never seen this before there's been a lot of difference in the Titanic Hydra there's like a zebra all of them seem to revolve around 80 and health very few attacks police ion have I seen so we will see this is one of the great Mysteries to me right now what it was like you know like that's it I'm sorry we'll see what comes through regardless or die down in CS bout to be there at that is the Extraco coming into the little one so he had it I've been sick the whole time but sore doing his best to go equal in the Scion might I think so much that he told it the end I think the fact that clown. 102 at the Stark actually really inhibits Griffin's overall game plan in this game like yes they did get the kills in the mid lane in the mid and jungle to equalize the gold lamp
