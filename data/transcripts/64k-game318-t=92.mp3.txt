every time he has been put back on the bench or traded to another team but he persevered you put in the hard work he went he grinded so Love Hewitt even went to Korea to Grantsville if he's there all his hard work has paid off this year on cloud nine and it's such an incredibly important match the most important of his career by far and you have to think already down one game if you drop a second it's so hard to come back against the team with this much experience and it makes it a really really important ones when I already Team Liquid with too fancy or Target at Spence Karen we saw five utilize the grave very effectively last weekend and I was going to join the Kindred on the list of Jungle Band dropping their zillion banned from gave one to do so otherwise this draft is be exact same as in Dearborn down track has the first pick and I see no reason for Team Liquid to switch their strategies Paisa extremely good in the legame doublelift is an expert on the champion we saw it last timeultimate well he's able to DPS Stowell Barkman players does and you can give it to that Gangplank your for C9 they did not really dominate your against the Scion in game one and they don't have to worry is it just going to be the Morgana again more focused on the try to get the TV to Advantage Property out there on the right side that showed that intentionally they're not showing either so alone or yet utilize their counter right side ear is elastic a solo laner to of the counter picks for it so that there aren't more options for teens liquid to go in and they just go back to Rob once again that was such a good setup for that they were able to go invisible and get the first blood on double lift with a jump through and basil Landing is donewell I do agree to try to look for half the counter pick on that sign the Scion I think is such a ridiculously consistent later there's not really a lot of pics I can't dominate here there are some that can kind of scale off of him and look for those liturgy messages but are you willing to risk it all on something like a Fiora who could take over in that one if you want I'm not sure that they are and now that they've showed up I was a hard that's not a surprise but a big do anything as well you don't really need to throw too many bands are so we'll see what the secret plan here for free food actually is pulling up it's just the syndra here as well as an old taking this one away from Smithy with allowed him that a lot of early present in the last game and it's good for the stuff to be about that we talked about it be about something that ReaperGolden Goose off that they feel that they can attack from the first game that he has shown us it's such a big event and we've seen a lot of things across the world use as substitute especially that jungle position exactly Identify some strategies what they've seen on the field from the enemy jungler and find adjusted at Smithy dominated last game completely constantly going for the invades and it might just be along those lines and there wasn't didn't work last night here for as they drop D is here been added Olaf to the list and there's the hover ondo their normal season game Squarespace Karen and gold include some of those killed best career on it for so many years World perform extremely well on this Champion North American final you wants to do it again and they definitely making some early changes in The Jungle Book very good combination irelia and says he has been used over and over again irelia Stacks up this done or said Juanita quickly that you can always threaten he's all into crowd control available to the duo he's insane if it is the or and I I kind of questions going to the red side.perhaps maybe even another Power pick on the blue side as they didn't really go for any link how to fix the blind pick their mid laner their last picking a tank I'm not saying this can't work but was the right side right about the Orange is something that has gotten Cloud 9 to where they are now a big part of their rise in the North American LCS summer split long-range ultimate from licorice they've shown him running towards the Midway try set up gate you'll for whatever made mine aren't they have it at the time or being able to start out those big T fight a great room for sneaky on the twitch the free fire alarms do say it even more focused on double if this time around here 4th PL while irelia certainly can a success in the team place in the late game it's a difficult for her to have a lot of the Bobby V so it's going to be about the tides for C9 you have to pick this recent me to have an effect in the early game to match what the money is going to be able to do later on because I'd make it all about SShe is there MVP player he is the All-Star fencing to be what's Cloud 9 will be targeting so he has to watch out I will Team Liquid keeping three of the same five Champions 597 two different players on this one even through fry some of those roles that mouth harp still in the middle and licorice off of damage Duty back onto a tank to play Team fight Team Liquid Frontline was far better in game one that set up double lift for a lot of success in the pivot for cloud nine puts a torn in front of sneaky switch to try to get the same here in game two hoping to type the series of Cloud 9 let's go to cells in the game 2before this early getting really going to have to watch this is business battle between Smitty between Spencer and and the rest of the squad sous vide certainly came out on top in that first game and feel was actually able to get both of the shuttle in those early moments and I think Tina is going to have to do one better this time around if they want to go to keep face and it's actually worth mentioning that the reason Team Liquid got both shuttles is a large part due to the bottom lampplay Matchbox the previous so that might just happen again here we'll see if that a patient's come in when you send of course can do some very good early dueling and had plenty of attacks to stock up if you need it but the bottom line is starting it off in a very similar fashion show more does Andy find his mark have you out play they're going to drink at work down not spotted by C9 and basil will not too too much I just kidding In this River I want to see what the options here for Spence Karen on this least in our this Champion is one of the most loved Champions and all of League of Legends because of the playmate ability that you have on these things I was going to have to watch where he places his trinket Wars and see if he wants to use those to pull off an early move around in Lane I'm going to knock down this road before. Much issue for the Dallas it burn and I'm going to take one more Auto after this is it goes down for trucks were pretty heady clear botlink wish to go to My Cloud 9 side as if we had LeBron the previous game and I think that's a really good Fallout will have to see what they are going to be if he's going to look up early or try to attack that mid-length really expect him to at least try to challenge or the scuttles on like we saw a Black River camp and again he runs this over heels so he gets a shield life feeling a little bit extra Spencer I know already out onto the field looking for impact impact has not yet level to get there right here look at the baby has it will tell her town too much time over to the Scuttle and that is a lot of early pressure there on Dan packet play on the big stage is able to take 1/2 of a small rose and get the regular split kill kind of feels so good but this time he knows at least in his on the top side from that early gang and he looked for it Nails the sonrisa que the Blazers than a kite are more than enough they made pobelter go and 8 in week 8 of the North American LCS but here it makes them start out with first blood for pobelter to Team Liquid in game 2 solo kill on a player that had been maligned by nerves so much this is his first time on a date this big I was so weak I might just shake you but we'll see what happens this time who's on here laying on his watch the Redskins matchup spotless hoping to go sequel toppling the summer and licorice not getting bullied nearly as hard to put out of course you dispense can talk about some of the ramifications of that kill as well pobelter did not use his Flash and killing goldenglue there did have to use his flash trying to get away so that does open up this pit Lane says wanting irelia like we talked about for a cup is his wife had took you to quickly get this done and as soon as those Capitol Building start coming through yet to be very careful and especially because they are also the expiry 6 if you can knock that pass it off to set it up as a heart is a team-based champion has a keep siding and Cloud 9 keep taking it feel for their team play in roaming around with credit if I fixed a hard time finding the word this time around all according to plan on the web wow just to take you can take it out thank you for it I've ever seen the top side though we have the real things going at it and this was a big issue in the last game the Scion packing up his grass constantly for this time around licorice with the help of Spence carrot note in the early gig is having a much better time here and he's on a tank of his own so once I get to the T V pill have a similar role loving Captain for 3 call come through for sticky picks up his own boots to dodge the dark Bon Iver. There a spot that word blocks level five on that and of course he knows better actually sent your volume yeah that barely missing may actually cause them to wait a little bit of time because he doesn't know that pobelter no 13th faded out a little bit you can cookies on the bottom side if you want it to be to kill you just want to be called Agro have to respect that and Aurelia they combine with his son to take down gold and blue once again and this is a 0-2 start for the subs very rough in a defense Karen also having his early game on this Leaf didn't do Chihuahuas he's not a head of this money at all Eddie's download Flashlight to have less play making when he gets sick are the games going incredibly would even with the oh Law Offices really nice with them some Farm pretty well for Seen On The Bus by little box that they fight against all right so keep liquid are planning this Counterattack Cloud9 what state what the Trap has been sit right here they just have to try and reacted get out only been able to do so good they might help her when they needed a boat and they really need to count on sneaky in the bottomlands there veteran with the squad to carry them through this early and now we're now in the Championships set here it is on this date you can not built off of some bad early gameplay in the details of that kill our personal this time or lake is missing flasher Morgana does it have it for a straight till next level more time will it does have a black shell toe feeling pretty confident that he's going to be able to live when he bought that stuff with you tonight the poison expunge all coming through this is again we saw the same combination you're from Cloud 9 Chico's invisible with which allows Azo a jump opportunity was waiting for that binding a jumped out of the way onto sneaky and allow them to pick up the kill is collapsing to this mid lane build his around that they could get cut off where it's at the game 18 liquid vision is the key near as they see them walk over and set this play up allow in the car for the road for the bottom leg goes plays around midlantic with so much about the vision as you said that Vision plate not catching the war by Midland setting up the TV to the response you're so quick to set up these played when they do the thing that is looking for them that's not for your glasses Kankakee engage watch that Midland flight once again is 50 sneak by the vision Smithy he's into Spanish perfume liquid doublelift had pushed Fairlane make it easy for them to the last on the Cloud 9 members of the plant is used at doublelift comes up with a gold after that one giant leap Leto 1100 goldleaf for Team Liquid defending NLCS Champions going for the back-to-back that look good tie the all-time any LPS Championship record of five titles for the best-of-five wind here today it looks like they are on face
