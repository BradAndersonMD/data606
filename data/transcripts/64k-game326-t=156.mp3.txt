strongest strategies to maybe they just need some more time and it will see them coming to their own this week's currently they are at 4 and 4 in the middle of the standings and would not lock want to drop a game here against optic because there's been a big rush tier towards the top of the standings and they still have a shot at shooting up right there and you're seeing DSM can learn some lessons from earlier the Talon away from power of evil he's a lot of funneling as well as sell funnel which is mid Smite but with a normal jugular they'll be played by Acadian town of the champion for that kind of strategy how to give me the news very standard tried-and-true red side band has not done a lot of different things they played standard self veraflox in very early funnily enough that there is song was playing during the break so it's kind of interesting and either way maybe their influence I got a heavily fix championthe record combo never mind which is more unique to facing off the gaming right it's one of these I tried that we seen recently midliners takings to my starting Raptor so you get an early level two and then our farming your way through the game with a big experience laid with Champions like a stock Echo Talon so there are many other option to Galveston Port of AOE you can do it with a mid lane champion and Bobby was always been a guy to cry no Smite or any sort of alternate strategies to get him or his team and Edge and I'll try once again off the gaming had a lackluster spring split and it's been a fast start this summer as well but it's built more games to play they can keep agency 9 to make that run towards the flask without the only two games behindplayoff spot as well if they can make the Run they've got 10 games counting this one to do it and they're going to hope they can make this one happen or sage in and pretty soon as well as a big probably expected Mundo for TOEFL here until I got the game play Corelli on hoping that maybe I'm actually plays into otherwise they'll want to grab those soon as they can honestly without that wants to run before we haven't talked about him a lot recently as it has been a huge amount of story around TSM hauntzer at the very good are Carey performance and we also even as of recently seen it in the bottom light so I got her like I'm Earl and something for TSN to work around right Global from the top they already have Tom Kent Global there from Missy the bottomlands been one of his most played Champions throughout his entire careerMobility here for GSM early on on the opposite side optic of course looking at those power fix they have the Kindred for Acadian and that guy isn't it is a jungler who likes to play carry a chance to invade a lot the maybe he'll be able to get it done here video snitching on the end that if there's a tank support for you with the kids it makes a lot easier for getting Vision on the bottom half the map and that is also true for themselves so that they have a pretty good for Relief Aid of the draft going already are set up to kind of play a good style for them to take pill to play in with the orange van right here, behold it count to pick to the mid lane and I got the one that I expect to do quite well for Optics mid laner of all time in North America is activated his number of trophies anyone else on the planet as far as NLCS trophies are concerned that he has been the star and its off the car to win it might just be through that lane and I can't help that happenI hope you never know if you kind of tripping around the side as well maybe it'll happen to sintra off the table no trundle for Greg either there is that Mundo band that they still want to remove some the big dump tanks at dhokla my flight between an interesting one because is the beginning of power of evils career a lot of ice buildup around defeating piercing help to get them blues Oakland or San Jose City Furniture very close together in time when the party of obviously used with a smile very effectively himself and look like they're going to be matched up in the window Cliff had been very good and Academy like way back last can we find some middle actually work I I like throwing things to the wall seeing what sticks thing I do, go to the beat of pain from the Top Lane hopefully your taxes there there's a cinch out done before Greg Laswell self-reflect or I cancel a jongleur convince the weakness of the champion is that you have no escapes usually but if you have a galio a gangplank ultimate and a possible Tom Kent bringing extra member play it maybe this is the top 40 at them to make some early to proactive Place once I get to level 6 is coming in and tries play around their jungler position on the team that has been changed out quite frequently and is always Hot Topic when you're considering their team if I want to take a quick look for their players and their style regions 12 Play what if I was already from him coming to the game now he is 2 out of 13 globally until a pit cover pic for him his second. Victor game of the split wood and Jen on the TV show is going to be all up to him to carry the galley the mid-length Kelly soon as y'all can be very very scary to on to you or two and won the game quiz so yeah I'll wait until later in the game he's also going to want early Mana in a rushing towards the speed upgrade for his huge trying to help out with that positioning as well so you love trying out new things he had the crazy Cinderella to be just fine klepto Victor into a melee matchup to scale up quickly yeah he's going to have a lot of opportunity to get those Auto attacks off to frock the klepto go for acute on a Galea whenever he moves up for the passive smash AOE damage should be able to get some rewards off of him and pink birdie over Bjergsen arguably the best galio skin if you disagree you're probably wrong and TSM does Fanning out to start things out optic doing the same school wait to see is that we get us in TSM are now two wins behind the first-place hundred thieves one window bring the little bit closer either way that would definitely their fate is in their hand TSM a poor showing for their standards and spring only at 56th exit in playoffs their worst ever want to make that better this time around and wait and klepto bag of gold yeah getting a slice out of gold off the first interaction here for power of evil this may bode well I mean the main goal is you want to fund your upgrades of your hextech or as early as possible and now it's going to get him there at that much quicker like we are going to have a bit of a distance on a Lancer start here for a drink with this is how is this going to be a rush to an early level 2 tank or something off of red I'm going to try and get maybe even a early level 3 possibility these standards Scuttle crab Wards are down so if he does mint Venture into the river early on he will be seen you can see those are the two words are Peter side there for optic that you see both Scuttle crabs interesting move also from Acadian who went red right into the baron wall you just answered prayers to get right over it so he's here for the spawn of this Scuttle crab and let's eat as much fun here or Katie and Fabian Griffin Walker right over there going to be a uncontested Scuttle no chance so of course for snacks before I give you bonus attack range but every individual stack gives you a bit of attack Cuba damage your WNDU so even individual one can matter of the course of time is going to be awesome. Blue buff invades on the boards or not it's still going to be a trade sides of the map here and it does pretty good for optical they want to have dhokla plenty of alone time early on with the Gangplank Jace is very impressive for the early stages the rain did Van do you know what a consonant get harassment off and push Hunter under tree early for a control board and is running has Western jungle in a bit are you going to be able to see him here and is there any much of a collapse mites gets one of the one of them gets stolen away and blast cones out he is not to be found but that was an interesting choice rather hoping to find a collab to pick up kids of that one will not happen I do like the attempt there they were a little bit quicker with the second half of their collapse the thin and Galileo from Midland to cut off that escaped maybe they at least for the flash from Acadian meanwhile on the bottom side looks like this then is fine with them anyway pushing towards them on the various and he's csing okay to be taken that opportunity didn't cost them too much I send it out a couple of minutes but he gets to pick them up right here at a lot closer than this ESV an ulcer painful right now for some that being kleptomancy on is this Victor slightly mashed by the gangway other side of the Jungle rating that driver Loft it could be exhausted as well the flash to give it more he's going to be chopped up no problem for the back end credit follow through there is almost no way out for not going to bring the flash proofed the goals go over to Richard receive Greg with multiple early bucior TSM their criticized for being slow and lethargic yet now proactive make the first couple of moves for themselves and are rewarded with some early Gold Hill on to big is going to go over and take another look at it now almost backed off their you know Arabic Camaro and big after this lowland is but they walked right back in his he was happy to finish up the stacks his first act in time out so he's able to get the last one was raised as well with the way it's going it's the disastrous for us because he also has a teepee both of them do you have two peas in the minion wave is actually just outside of turret range so it's not that big of a deal controller the fur optic means if it'll be a little bit more of a frog. Your 40s Batman going to go for them lay here to pick that one up Michigan down there maybe earlier with the top 10 she could try and threaten not being away the Scuttle crab from a far range but I know it's a bit too dangerous to fight over that one you do want to deny the marks to Kindred but you don't want to lose your life over here is another replay of dope for the all-in jumped in with the mail a cat's the Slowdown nice move it there with the auto attack and then he even though they both went early at the auto off of Power okay 300 goldleaf now CSM the first Blood of course making that change happened here for see if there was the toppling to right now at Oakland not pulling Hunter all of that hard and now a level 6 Gangplank can a factor not quite strongly also send estimate of game can be written as well as one V3 old he is. He's going too fast you can play there from Joe Clyde ice Greg flash he's in with inside out until it has not come right back under the turret and give that kill over to Katie and as you said not only to get the mark he gets the kill money onto the Kindred which is going to be very big for him early on already has a large to get lead in the jungle over great because Greg has been throwing out gank left and right through a lot of moving around the map and akkadian has been hard farming the jungle there on the Kindred so even though it to another early move from DSM and they're being super-active on the map cross that plays left and right counter kill their for optic they got honestly more back out of that county park with the exercise as well because that was a blast of Jefferson and Greg force it plus giving over the mark now maybe lots of wave is kiwi shoved it in either way nice hair back and forth I quit klepto track on both sides if I can inspect my playlist yeah I immediately have nothing I so we're done and you're fired fired I am one of the worst investigators of all time and that is unlucky that's okay we're back in the bathroom I found out all right back on track
