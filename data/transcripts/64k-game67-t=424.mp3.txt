very worrying trend for Cloud 9 is that I cute into a random Nexus was game with Licorice and Vulcan and they were unable to carry me you know how so I was pretty heavy to be fair that game but no wearing very worried indeed they can do it I want to see some pop office but I would like to see it again aggressive. Speakers full of Courts Olaf Remains the most important fan against Cloud 9 10 jongleur can fly ever find something else that I wanted to touch on quickly with the jungle pool here is that why burritos is getting a lot better get them so much actually been over 73% of the time again five 9 and that is includingReese first games of this place where you got to play it back to back to back so bad every single game you know there's not as many carry options for him to go to as there are for a lot of the other junk was the end of the week and I think you know when people are talking about the fact that the Irish always liked Ares you shouldn't be on trundle yesterday can consideration that most popular junglers that are carried style he hasn't played and whether that's he's not comfortable doesn't like playing with that first aisle is it another question to answer but I do think that cloud nine it is very easy to pinch the jungle pool and push flower off of a more of a jerk Harry Styles and as a result she knows they're they're having some time to show up on on the status of the trundles and and the day for us and things like this when it gets what they would want to he's been able to flyimage of the three Olaf pics it's been unbanned once since then and I was taken away is the first pic when they're on red side so yeah it has been delivered. Fayetteville a person to be more and more mostly a jongleur from what I've seen and pearl flake Caitlin by the way I think is most important in League of Legends right now I think she has the strongest Slater in League of Legends I think Jeff has advocated match up into a switch benign Rush pick up to receive as a rock but I really like Caitlin in the bathtub Morgana he was going to make TSM I mean things should be just like to just flip down plates like a pot trick to this fall it 10 minutes this game based on just can't be something right now. I make here that's just happened right now you go to work the pope support and be okay to work on his right arm affect exactly what I was going to say don't agree I do think if they if they went to Ward you know like a minute later or something and then piece of workreally good in to CC Champions at Hardin Gates Champions where they're easy to block of the black field jacket can't really struggling to Polk South Champions like Karma even pretty problematic yes, is in danger if you do ever get trapped up because you are Squishy in the end of finding into the Trap it's probably going to be death but in a straight have to be to wear Vulcan inventor not getting hit by binding they should have the winning lash-up I do feel now, plus Ash has incredibly strong push you can utilize the queue on the back line from the karma Diwali as well as going to help you know maintain but then the Caitlin is pushed back under fur turret and being poked out that could be a difficult situation so I like that answer here from Cloud 9 vs theoretically this still could be a soul in, but I am going to assume it is for the to be too and I think the TSM is doing the same thing here bending towards midline Cloud 9 also the targeting beards in here with a little bump in it does happen in the first game of the split so far in summeragree to point though I think the addition of, turn that mess around a fair bit I think we should see a lot of pressure down here in the bottom side right set and Volver have decent control we're seeing a lot of explosive Midland band skier as well you see Cloud I'm trying to get rid of some of Dirksen carries right live long and Silas off the table TSM didn't know what this key style is galios wouldn't be that surprising either it wouldn't I'm I'm wondering about the silence band at the if that's you know about 9 saying that they want to actually go towards something even liked malphite there are some of those those texts that could be devastating to have the ultimate stolen away your silence is not kind of generically popular these days a lot but he hasn't actually brought it out you know no one on PSN without you play Styles have to split so this is something or a nod to a specific counter they are trying to avoid Kenan also you know that would be a pretty devastating all to steal and it does seem like they are going to save last pick your for mid lane to try to interfere is actually available that could just go back to it if you're going to have I think it's absolutely Immaculate game on the zillion in their last game if he was incredible and it was paired alongside with Kayla I don't really see any any reason why you can't go towards a zillion it would be blind there are some a cup you have to be a little bit worried about but generally speaking once you get past the early levels on billion you are very comfortable in pretty much anything irelia interesting so this could be made or top we don't we don't know just yet it is a flex pack and they might want to go double Flex we used to do this a lot in the past I couldn't you know call is Allison what type of things were very meta people go double flex-o-lators and then just adjust bass on the matchup I don't think that you would want to be playing ghirelli into the canyon so I am expecting that to be can a baby see if it would be Top Lane a r l e n e will get you out of opting into that so very interesting stuff you're right I do think that broke or the Westside Lanes a peacock I think would be fine I want you again have some bubbles in your ear especially when you hit sick to Wayfair becomes a very good it does make it more about the Tea fighter and the Poke and they would maybe struggle to answer and so I could go with something else where is not profly broken plate of licorice or better than a few more than average in Kenner loses more than average against you know the field compared to this doctor so this should look at least according to the Houston have a great wife Elaine Morgana you're pushing a tenant good luck with that once he is going to make you dye it a little bit late for my taste in that can be difficult if you get behind and gold otherwise you're getting free fired on you get dark binded by Morgana and you're probably just dead before that thing drops is Ash throws damaging to you the same time though you got to close a team fighting on the other side right Cloud 9 disc look really really nice with the fact that pain in flank we just saw them his manhood entire game announcer isn't has an incredible amount of seats has lots of set up for the healing trap steel Gold Card binding even earliest honor or the set class from Les Mis on there potentially Kent trap out of that I will stay even if it is or irelia you having the ability to win that later on of microcephaly of Kevin is is that Kenan no winds pretty much all these ranged vs. melee matchups at least for the first early levels that you are going to have pushed I do think that Post 6 a really has potential to all in the cannon and where I can get more dangerous but you know there are answers there are ways for 9 to even deal with the TF and I think one of those is Kenya's year have the push right and if is your can actually keep drinks in a locked and returned it since he can consistently put it in you know we did see that there was that nerve on TFW obviously it's going to be a logger cool now which means you are going to push a little bit more slowly have less access the blue cards refill the man of the red cards push it out that's something where they could get an advantage of his ear has him locked if it's who we do is going well for the Vulcan and they can push with impunity because TF is stuck under store it then things can start to get tough thing for TSM little play hear the Cloud 9 did licorice comes down to be in range for Vortex P I believe in Fulton III Championship are you get level 2 off of the first wave of the Soul enter the bladder reveals it get last hit and liquor shops to the weeks that one awake in a little bit here to see the jugglers do is start their respective redbus TSM doublelift treats want to go right away into attacking this again bottling is really really volatile go to get to push has a really big lead in that one top link removal tool as well as you're saying Kevin probably feels comfortable in the dirty as time goes on that can flip when he becomes a reality be 12 years and having to play really far back but the fact that Miss Kika right here, you can see Volcan is going, as well they're indexing more highly to Wards Lane phase through this is not are you this is not Guardian this is no, going for, here and then trying to play just lay there going to have pushed they're going to look to pressure I wouldn't think that's also very nice about the lethal Tempo is that you hit them with the volume Proctor Eagle Temple and then you can use all that bonus attack speed to actually constantly shoving that way if he even more heavily and you can see as a result SS already missed three minions know when you are getting pushed in Non-Stop by this, by the sash it can be difficult at some of these minions are always going to come to the turret the right Mount of help and you can see the trailer back and forth Vulcan puts on The Shield is okay let's go hit you a little bit deals new it back and forth for us we are Relic Shield here despite this healthy stuff in the previous patch and I do think spell cease would have been viable in this game but with housing that's playing laying out that you're still going for the safer options on both sides and the guaranteed building coming to rebuild in case things go wrong I do think it's a good point because specifically when you are playing this title match up with your plate,, if you don't have the Mana regen you are actually going to run out of me that you're not going to be able to rescue on the cool down the whole time he's really aggressive betray you know we saw he use the key for the speed up Shield himself to try to dodge a binding and then you can go in for some of those Auto attacks spell tease would give you a lot more mineral gen to be able to to kind of keep seeing you up that he has a higher risk High reward because you don't have the same amount of Health that you would have here with that Relic Shield and you also have to be consoling putting air of yourself at risk to go for those place but it looks like they're trying to poke it down how to set up a dive here if they could get more damage Down Yonder SS remember there's no huelen double if it's TP so there is potential to actually pull off a diet but they're not going to go for it they don't know exactly where the set is and haven't quite got SS or treats low enough to to Signal a dive and ultimately speak it as end up skipping his drugs to take stop Scuttle and then write you recall by for a minute to get back where you started up in your pants come back up for now that we think we can head towards the top side of cases of play licorice has to be respectful the fact that he is in a 1 b 2 before too terribly wants because around try to stay in fog I believe he got seen and so this is actually kind of awkward for him he doesn't work there but it is on a pink horrible so that's good early damage licorice down to about 1/2 HP already and Prince of Flash not sure he had two Broken Blade could you again but there was no extra son either way licorice is I don't want any part of this when I'm out blood work and fight for a ward I guess but and this is now a really difficult top light and the TV goes back in 57 say about yeah that was actually really really tough liquor to put in a pretty bad spot he was doing fairly well informed but because he just had a waiver to tonight from him you know it is going to be broken plate in the lead licorice you nor did not have the cover their from blabber set could have been in the area to look for title play with respect to that and as a result the wave got frozen I'm broke up with me sitting in a great spot to see all so forth the flash so now the anther wolfcamp was taken on the way down words but because of toppling pressure they at least the night wolves weight room plus me to lose the time recalls coming through now crossing a double for the black shield on. Sit down with a Q gets the route and doublelift is going to be hiding in the back and side do you have to go doran's shield on Caitlin of all things how aggressive is a scar Moline can be how to put the more defensive option find going to land from treats that eventually double Focus recall off should be able to four BS or does so indeed they're not too bad this is actually a really great if we try to force them to stay around because his younger is behind but either way it will go after questioning if that's not a marksman teleport to Steve behind him and because we're out of a manhattan-based you can actually go for that and it would be pretty devastating either way they're going to lose that beat the whole way because this is not a Canon wave recall has been no will as a result and we pretty much even on Farm they're going to take this time and said to go for plates they are going to go for that rag in and grab the first dragon hear for themselves so going in the paper of cloud nine year they did have a portion portal to recall and we'll have some nerve damage but Pretty good overall you know it's all right there what you just saw that is what TP buys you the entire way was lost from the event of both gold and experience + yellow + Douglas to also help with the right to make sure it's completely safe but no one's going to stop that that is what you get for burning teleport about 6 minutes and Elaine yes I still think C9 could have played that bottling slightly better and recall in front of Cannon it would have still lost the great but they would have left left golden experienced regardless is the state we are now and where the game is once again pretty much tied in Gold double once again very close on Farm overall and hate going to feel pretty good for the early game right now is that neither of us 69 Soul winners have there flat so we have to track can speak actually make anything happen in this next couple minutes a few minutes have passed since they did get burned but that's far not much has come from it but you can see them pushing doublelift back about a third of his help knocked down there but he still has three biscuits he's not really in much danger I would be surprised if she completed this recall I do think that's just that him kind of messing around a little bit. Because he has a lot of sustained with those three biscuits + is Orangefield and Fleet footwork you know this is a fairly defensive kind of survival install set up and you can see Bleiberg and moving up here with licorice make sure that he does
