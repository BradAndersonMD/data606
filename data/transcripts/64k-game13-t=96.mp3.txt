basically here at EG that are undefeated undefeated team in sure there's more to play but whatever by far the worst team in the league base with HO2 skillshare Kobe it's been tragic for black was so far it's been a really really rough ER Altima supposed to roster still around navigate for you free most played Champions we'll see what the last band is beer from Geniuses maybe they continue to whittle down to Leah and Natalie already taken off so either or Graves left hanging we don't see on the graphic either way they'll Olaf is 2 / highly prized absolutely. I do still prefer graves vs Olaf again even though are there been a lot of losses for the grade vs Olaf and Elsa gay at an opl because and with good level one planning you can get the grave. So very very good start and you can try and abused the the reins backed up it is one of the few as you're stating that you know against a lock that I would actually like to Pilot prefer to be on the on that grave site progress I think right now it's so flexible you can play him in almost every position but we haven't seen it as carry bottomlands but it out I think it would work out okay just the PC Larry gets pretty reasonable but otherwise I agree let's not go for that one but yeah 83 does not have natural Escape because if there is even far from Ian to our space is so many times but obviously I assist you with that so I could think of maybe something like like delete Liotta also does no ad on top of your eyes I like the cop in itself of grass players try to play that one outs but we shall see already been coming through right now topland are going out to table also dropped off as well which is always tough because you know it is the nerve and cut the grass at the Alex Orban going to do anything if I could just put in the sport roll to see that one will have to Blind there benefits to figure out where the grass is going before they lock it in both solos I mean I was just kind of can't cuz jungle in a locked but dropped off so they're going to put a different brackets most likely is not a bit later to the lake well if he's going pop then you can't you can't play games like good enough for us and I feel like a lot of possibilities and text Doug over and over for EG rejected rejected rejected he is very good at playing at tank so the ORD is picked up that not going to win the lane like he was doing with the Renekton abilities are still really good teleport ways really good wife for him so those same kind of therapy go through three as well either the bottling place or in mid wait to see you later either way she's mostly played as a hard support down there exactly sure they do need a real top I mean there's still a chance it's practice before Saturday me to call the top or theirs. I'm going to say the most likely is Gamora is obvious one of the Dragons. Fairfield before I really think that he's been playing Super well way better than after the bank and he talks about really loving this new team last year did it feel like they were coordinated and if so how this continues to manifest a squad of players continues to grow because he can without remote leaf and it's the all right if the cops are locked it still shots really care about minions in the way so she should be able to play outside of Hope distance is always keep them in middle and end of the forest the opposing Sports have like walk through a like Make It Rain or like the Serafini slow and distribute really easy heart Bush Lane with a lot of control I actually love this combination even though I don't play a lot of bottom land this is one of the super easy to execute super long-range went because Sarah has such long range with harassment and Misfortune make it rain this past you know where your marker is saying like it is very easy to single out someone off in the in the lane and hit them with both of these just big chunks very very safe as long as you don't get hit by school shots and are you can hide behind minions and watch out for the Flash plays in and jungle place from thresh but otherwise the long-range harassment is insane from that duo is because Misfortune has a slow on the kids if their slopes every year upgrade into a route if they're ordered it from sarafi surfeasy to upgrade into a full stun so misfortunate actually provides an extra layer of ground control to Serafina in Cabo. In the ultimate that's like three four seconds of Hearts PC which means the NFL is pure start MF to try to spam that's not going to surprise you very much either Guardian for seraphine is outstanding because it will shield herself as well which means her W will heal it would have just killed a lot of really good choices here in this convo is that the Make It Rain is instant so you'll see good combos who have played this play with my friend you can cast your GE and then Misfortune also can cast reflux mostly at the same time it'll land it then gives credit for the slow for the for the snare and it's just really really hard for your opponent's to react to good to lay in bed here they they want to make use of that level one priority see if they actually even leave behind they were there we go. Does it delaying a little bit longer so that it will last a little bit longer 108 into the game like this more so than the brush by the blue oyster going to go in Reinventing the steel blue anyone else was hitting up in that brush you just want to see if they're doing like in case you lose track of somehow the dump in a fog like this is just the word you want to go for they're going to go get ya Pastor Flash in time to get away from the rest of this go from bad to worse Open Arms by the entire 5 man squad of eegee's Stephan stays around to say what's up oh my goodness all right so I love going for this power-play you do you have a crazy level wide bottom playing with the seraphim Misfortune that we're talking about and Olaf like that is it should be able to get a pic and should be able to fully out any even numbers match up that you find however this is not even numbers surprise surprise a blast coat over the entire team of EG turns it around they kill Jose no flash on the Olaf either and remember freaking Chef Select when I'm talking about liking the graveside of this matchup and it depending a lot on the start guess what ideal face wash Grey's with flash advantage over Olaf get the power Farm earlier because Jose died a little bit quicker there oh my goodness this is this is so nice to have been scaring okay so yeah you start obviously song Little Eva lamps up because it's been an exciting start of the game already Palafox to use out pictures I'm going to come up Wednesday for Johnston with the Teeter it's not quite infinite Mana it's like before you got into your feels like an infinite but really good lot of pressure down here you can see the goal is to have been pushed in and the farm is coming soon but you can get a lot of damage here if you haven't got a standstill to get my pictures I got to go for an early. And just like that I'm here I'm here and by the way here's a route years of starting a lot of damage and it's just cold and very beautiful play. Works out now for EG they moved them off of the minion way they do things a lot of experience lost their and because licorice got a really nice Chunk on to deathly right before the arrival of Decay that match even with the zucc a-coming there's no turning around they can't be punished for this aggressive strain behind the tower they have no health bars with which to do it so it's a lot of Defense there from Evil Geniuses and it results in teleport advantage and a rotation here from Palafox I like this play look at the ACs difference here cuz if they went down to the bottom you're good at you're going to miss out because of how fast does the entire wave into mid then rotates the top four that waive your akali gets the dream scenario going to get to level 6 without any effort at all and this is perfect because I was talking to Palafox add this card last week asking him you'll for a possible spoilers he said if I get a collie I can one be 9 so I want to see it all right. It was leading up to the game vs EG the undefeated team so what you do from Sprint. this will sacrifice place 10 minutes of the top is all about the aggressive plays all about the Tea play now pox is at that level six. Oz actually part of the fight just going to be a lot of damage wanted I'm just going to be a lot of pain does have flax. Going to help you much the way I hereby even has the extra landed here making a follow-up Diamond does not land that's they're onto definitely trying to get away by Jose wow everybody's looking at towards the bottom side Olaf power climbing Through the Jungle trying to catch up after the disastrous level 1 invade for himself and is at least able to get that do drugs effective for Life West the damage down here that was kind of going to happen to them is quite low 5436 CS over in that midlane is the TF keeps trying to scale top laners are closed but again a pretty tight game between these two 425 Huntersville difference is what in early First Blood cost so even after the field invade the teams of an overall living about equal and the reason we didn't see in fact in the NATO Spotify plays is obviously that he used to sell for it level
