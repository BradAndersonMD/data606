are in the draft right now I'm going to keep it a secret to keep building versus the rematch right before you on your screen please take a look here getting right into Champion Select Renekton first Bic but it is an LVL beam so right oblique Lowe's dragon souls to the claims 40 minutes and it went back and forth with Genji did flame it may be jungler very kind with topside even if Ray's were up you would probably still go Billy. He also did first big Renekton for launching but I like the adjustment that they've made them while they do keep the confidencethere they ban Out The Illusionist I'm there blue side at a little bit more flexibility with them now they lock in double AP for themselves Lilia work super well with Renekton drunk Renekton Top Lane because you can put allow her to you on with some of those in bed we probably will get one of those level ones as well be so quick to answer the immediate volibear into the Renekton it love the way match up as well as the in Italy in to Lilia focus on the hard engage that's definitely something lb will lead you know because one of the big things that people always point out for an accident is the fall off later into the game and fall off his because he had a difficult time getting a priority Target do you have only a single targets done so you if you are unable to get that single Targets on an enemy carry then your usefulness in the T fight is far below a standard tank from the topside if you had something like a Leo not like a nautilus to get some easy hard engage onto that back linecan you store up some of the weaknesses that are always talked about for the champion and while I people don't like the early pics right now you seeing couple of bands to support she is gone away in Pirates of the Caribbean like a galley open tethering really hard enough of your players from before world or mostly drawing away from the pic so that could be metagame being left mid lengthall right if he goes for the classic all right I'm not too far away from now Mark and Ethan Fort for for lgd need to come through to be able to push through the mid-game near Pantheon I have absolutely love this Champion Force before it's it is going to be really really focused on early game for lgd the weather in Acton pick on the top side Pantheon on the bottom side with gin there's a lot of crowd control that you can use to set up kills to set up CC chain on your bring the Lily off of the efficient clear that you can bring into those Lanes to actually try and get killed and it means that we are very low engagement Genji side of skull much of a kite fat composition has beer Santa and not one good reliable start a team fight tool nothing remotely close to even throw up in sleep and obviously the pantheon certain things often even better so lgd have a lot more control over how the game take to completely different directions here for you guys are going to have the properties of Tompkins trying to avoid scenarios where is lgd they want to bring the fight to you get those killed pressure with Renekton counter with the combinations of gin and Pantheon see if they start anything out with the level 1 million billion kind of facing off on the top side of the map by the Raptor camp quite CD inventories we'll have to see one of the rooms. To see if there are we first left for them pretty standard ruins across-the-board though no surprises the only little caveat sometimes his ear will go with Haley weaker scaling ruin in favor of a better laning room I think lethal Tempo because of the Wave Control you can get by propping it off the Oriana and then pushing the wave is a really good choice plus the attack speed super useful for you later on to the game what do you want to get to of course not what you said earlier Kobe as you said no early invades we've got a heavy leave here for peanuts with red bumps not doing it going for the chickens and leasing. Rest of the Lakes Region of course doesn't need that much help does putting out a pretty heavy leash for Autos out of his Djinn down there so instead of Health which I don't think is a prop nobody is it is a choice you making V not touch the chicken through interesting as well doubled we first start for LBD really like it with a with a gin Pantheon laying their replies on kill pressure it brings up scenarios where you want to try and Bluff a lot and sent it to the early Sweet Berry uses it right there coming through and they have no early in Vape information on Peanut we're about it honestly changes your way match up a little bit because you are purposely denying this information while going to hear that that Millie drops use the available for the sun got the right before the flash easy follow easy Flats follow option for than everything else oh my God I feel so bad for peanut you just clip that last 10 seconds and you have a blooper reel of all-time heat flashes forward but your watch out sleep moves you forward on Lilia and so he overshoots it over the following Bears head straight back in a really fancy can I get to Landon and they trade blows back and forth. He wants an insult to injury peanut yeah clip bike after that sort of play you don't even deserve your own jungle peanut chases him out this is going to be our son does nothing at all easy Tower aggro drop and this game has gone from bad to worse and it's still happening like rooting the battle here against Mark to get some Auto pick up more volume down Campground will live but I'm afraid of the runaway guys are keeping going out to go holy moly freaky you better already start handing out your tilt proof Duloxetine care that happens in your laid and you are freaking out okay focus for lgd he's on the bottom side you see him trying to scavenge he knows that played already chased him out of the top watch where the map cannot return to this area which is very unfortunate for long thing as he's incredibly far behind on the Renekton now after those early shamanic but it is honestly does have to turn into everybody looking to fend for themselves to try and recover from that early game deficit going to have a field day. Pool priority ncdex toward they are bringing this is part of the Jungle we talked about early on keeping up the pressure peanut that wants to punish with Mark and just tell back right now the owners are all going to Mark thanks for the road buddy be able to clean up the top side of the map and that honestly is such a lifesaver for both peanut and long thing all the types of the map here for lgd it's still going to be a very difficult scenario but Mark is able to find a perfect timing window to run here on the pantheon has an impact tell me about this doing this to make a Joker fight did burn Smite on the chicken with me that's what his deal is it going out of you could do it easy pick up there but not want me to find some peace and still stand up. He's going to laugh at you completely fine to heal him to go right back and get the Hill from Rascal any blinds that you want to kill last call Ono Shockwave get the hate and she is going to call you for the extra speed does it have any extra damage to Philadelphia TV after you move the cue over to Aunt and bdd knows you can return to put the wave afterwards so he gets the last laugh in that little head straight there she a decent attempt but definitely going to come up short there would be had the extra juice pretty quickly for lgd mm 6 minutes that is rough enough to take so much effort to come back from this and get to see what happens in a second ago the dark side and tires came through it was started that one house I mean while on the bottom side this is the calm area of the map since Jenna's gone with the the new tech we're actually kind of liked it you know you start your boots and your bunch of health potions or exit fee for Jen Wheeler.. On some of the forecast through damage there but mainly it's for the extra potions or the subjects the saying that you get for the lame meanwhile ruler able to farm up in time for the purchase of the tier Placentia lox warts on his first back and gets to head right back Elaine I got to say son of Tok been chilling with no surprises everything is telegraphic Grizzly fare for it turns out he's got no help and they're going to drop off a throw-in Time Genji find another kill cops that I was hoping to see more pressure and we're gonna be so much focus on that early blooper reel from peanut at the topside freak that was just the most devastating thing that can happen to your lane as a top laner and yelled you can see him right now watching is just try to keep it together he's only level 5 to a level 7 volibear so they can go for those Dives and he doesn't have the extra help to come out but they've pulled off a swap you trying to get him out of the Lane Benton to the bottom side of the map bringing up ruler hey so I want to see if this can still be preferable for Rascal they can use them to get a lead or we stuck in a onesie to no longer for me against Kramer and Mark went to jail plays out right now Genji have sent to you like mid-length no fighting just yet securus.net for the Senate of a long story that is going to be most likely lethality opener can come to lunch with to go to Black Fever phrase correct building this one is the topping took me under Fire it may just play Jeff Burley swapping the first one to do the play they get to push them anyway first well in The Blind Side you can see that Rascal has a long thing at once again you're not getting away from the match up and it should be constant bullying you know he's gotten graston to the Conqueror of Renekton so there's actually no way that Renekton ever win the trade War 4 for the rest of this game honestly I had such an early lead you go in your short trade for volibear it's always trust the rejected if you don't get to stack up your conqueror maybe if Brad Pitt washing random was able to find if I can go somewhere else and get to a play the ruined King Sooper super quickly somehow you'll be able to have an answer but Rascals can discharge of his brass prop to go in for the sheen trade and there's really not a lot of function get to say about itself meanwhile suspended time stop stop side to get that very important early Richfield love this movie or where he can guarantee themselves make the trip plates and up to the counter jungling what temperature right now he's fight for that one Roth wants to be launching who don't know what to do about to put runaway devil wants her not strong physically pastors that got the night away from nekton the XP got froze the gold Gap roads going to look pretty good in this picture play number 345 to the under-fire topside almost dead as hell to sell all right don't DC let's see what kind of Miracle kind of recovery can't can we actually get up here because top side of the map is a possibility Kramer and Mark has can't eat a lot of people down but that's where Clint is going it's just such a smart move from Blades he knows that there's no way that Rascal actually get taken advantage of all the box at the Mapco used to rip out there that's okay aluminum fuel pressure a little bit of support I'm here for you I want this a legal age of accountability no flat shoes by Phoebe Ryan is David there either so she ate and peanut you find some purchase for themselves and for compensation of the mountain breaks and everyone moved around the way it did all the pressure was topside for Genji a big dick came through they strike top you strike somewhere else because I have three B1 is unlosable as we have seen so many times and then I found a pill to keep the gold within 2000 the golden termite has not moved about four minutes and another look at it Shockwave did hit their 48ddd was trying to trade back thinking that you can have a one-v-one but what's peanuts last in really like this
