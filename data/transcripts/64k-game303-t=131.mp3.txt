he got caught on a war then go by Hillsong Young & Reckless then head over to Midland watch the river instead of fat behind the turret and one do you want killed by Reckless we need to see ID for paying that respect over to fanatics fanatics have clearly shown they can not only win but dominate against ID and ideas going to have to play a much more clean game if they want to come out first in this group that's going to talk about these a collie and a rally of Anthony not showing up in this one is still going to put that Camille ban against Nick move some of his familiar options there isn't picking start dropping Tanks off the table and we'll see what the traffic to look like there are so many things to consider here I know that fanatic probably have to Blind pick one of their solos and I'm curious what that might have been looks like if I'd be goes for counterfeit caps with the blind pick and rookie winning the lady face very heavily often farm and again now they are on the right side so we could be seeing another rookie counterpick in midlane and if he has thatmake the attacking that midlane attacking and grouping up with caps to try to get him in that is a blind pig midlantic Ali and catfish trying to do like a great first impression he had probably the most impacted by Kali game I think I've ever seen or whether this is going to be with on the top side trying to play it is something like an old Italian style in that matchup what if you are willing to play the irelia in aurelia's good news match if you can Flex that as well. So we have to see where ID does take us in this next Hill we'll pick another criticism leveled at Jackie love is a fact that he keeps going back to the generosity on social-media thing because the guy that has played much more lame dominant 80 karrie keeping something like as I give me something I can and let the young man go to workis it down at this time around I do like Jack 11 to play Stronger Elena to tell if there's a great team fighter as well on this diet there contouring is there the hills on can always be grab that himself earlier on is it worth taking away the wreck on and making your body to the night from the opponent having that xayah rakan and that's what is going to have to decide and looks like they're going to make the call that it is worth it but then you can look for more preferential Scooby-Doo match up here you already have a fairly Lane dominant Marksman with his diet and you pair that with another advantageous 4th something like Leona compare well it look for kills again through a conflict that could be a way for IG to look for winning way to have not worked out the way a lot of pain so it was going to pump polarity of Leona to not be punished honestly Willows Run so far so I think that would be a nice pic to go to was also the fact that you know now is as real you don't really have to worry about lifemaybe just drop the priority of that pick up a Bass jungle off fan two of those awakes make Brookes or suffer the kind of people that might want to go towards those tests and said they don't want to get pinched on for the possibility of Izzy cream of the crop once you see that work on here for Sia's real face pic no one that was coming and you want to be safe against Leona against irelia expressly should still fairly safe and should not require attention nor the babies think however bottling and now he'll son cannot run out nearly as much as you have to remember that is Fanatics bread and butter that is always what they want to buy them the ability to make plays on the map in this is certainly not the lane to really do it the way that can be a soft in the Middle Lane is c a r l e ever goes in just hit the root get your Aftershock walk away in case I call it does get flexed over keep in mind IHG get last day on the mash-up they're willing to pick the early Indy calling they're going to watch his Whipple pics of Top Lane Champion as well or move the akali and we speakgoing to get those stolen car fixed without the ability to put a rally in one of the strongest Champions into the midline that can be protected in this drop and it does allow juice if he wants you to play a Carrie up in the Top Line while still having bright engaged something that means played against T-Rex I believe and played it to a tremendous level and I think if they could get through the early game with a pic like that can be very strong but then you do have to worry about the fact that Proctor has a very strong early game performances a couple of lead-ins that he turned it have look really really good and we know that Zack can be punished early sometimes and if you fall behind you that Lisa and maybe never really get the chance to get the given scale steam play Olaf Leafs in trundle even are still plenty popular 24-hour place when will pick the available that Zack is left up as well and Invicta if no dragons probably and if you canHorse Sense there is a good damage a good early game Frontline jungle it's not only that actually really messed up that late in combo when leasing goes in a few just buddy plant back toward that make the cake a little bit harder than any specific it's also kind of that to do tank so once again you can do exactly what we said with his axe throwing the gauntlet buy firewood South style and I don't think nothing has really sell his prostate in that Way the final picture of an attic what is Whipple going to play with you keep the akali or they locking it off later and put that went into words made they lock in a tank for him to whip o will go back on it before and we have to call in the middle Aiden & LeBlanc vs. akali in the midline is another advantageous match up for rookie this is one of them. A lot of people have been looking at as an answer to call in the middlewith those distortions and looking to dominate that lame as rookie has been known to do is also one of the Mind Games with Heidi has done multiple time now carry they stop jerking they picked himself something that is flexible and then all of a sudden stop playing as well I didn't want to give away one of the safest top-class midline is in the game right now I think the flexibility of this has really helped ID in the pot and well it is a Cari Champion it's certainly not the few are where you have to come in this is much more of a team fighting carried this is a composition that certainly can look at a scrap with the Natick if they try to draw them into that by B5 so it's going to be a very exciting game on the line if your seed wants me out of the group you're playing Edward gaming Cloud 9 or G2 Esports in the quarterfinalshere we watch the EU LCS but if you received two if you do lose this game your battle for KT rolster the Korean Champions World never give up their own right the only other Korean time remaining in this tournament definitely things to play for in this time Breakers are in the quarter-finals but who do opponents will be are going to be decided now or the next half hour of League of Legends fnatic Invictus gaming on the rift the battle for the top spot in their group and we'll see where the fanatic can continue that momentum that was such an impressive Victory it would still be fresh on ig's mind and things me to change the Invictus lineup Nautica setting up for a bit of a cheeky Little Wonder records has been spotted to find out how is Q I like that if you was up able to get away no problem though and it will be a fairly uneventful early game free golden Reckless when's the Q that doesn't result in anything but I like the attempt right you do going for these pre-planned level one there's very little drawback to the most the time and sometimes it is going to get you a kill sometimes it is going to get you a Summoner at the very least it will show your opponent's a hey we can mix it up in the early game and you have to play knowing that we could be waiting in any Bush and I think this is two games in a row actually wife and I decided on the only game we mention the fact that it's laced then pulled his wife got pushed in allowed himself to scale-up never really want Alain versus the shop it certainly was more relevant as a game for Creston was more of a team fighting for it this time around we'll see whether he is able to do the same thing he's going for a little bit of a cheeky Peak into the top side of the map now with North when they hear starting I like that where the IG puts down it shows they're trying to push really game this really cute as well it should track most of rocks and fossil gang fast and I think you should be able to show up without any difficulty tell if I'm going to be. In place little bit of damage but this phrase not going to mean to do much either way though it is IG getting the stuff down here going to post and it will lock Hillsong up this is already brought to moving down if he comes around this way down you will not be spotted by the ward so we could be going in well he's only going to be level 2 on this one is going to walk for going to space Truckin to land the Cuban Jack you look a little bit early waterproof and they failed of last name from Jack Elam too late he brings lease it straight to him and brought some another game another first bought on the boss and you can look at it to write a The Flash the initial cheer and just admit that you messed up if it gets kind of have to hold you have to flash much later in between the landing of the Cuban the first one that comes out because otherwise applied you're just a Sitting Duck but once again you got to go for an early gameplay Sala fan. A 32 days in a row and able to execute on something like this happened this is avoiding where that Vision was places smart passing from Roxette it should have perhaps just been a Summoner but even then it would have been worthwhile and instead it is a first slipper broxah two games in a row incredible start for fanatic Forest that is beautiful right there from fanatic they saw the Lord come down to new the root rot so I had to take an executed very very nicely there so foreign to goes lead for fanatic making this so late in the group stage they had lost my ID back in the first round robin but might find those who wins in a row now in the back half is once again engaged before it's too damn much and I'm sitting here thinking you know people saying caps vs Realty this is Elaine match up to watch before rookie where is early to take the midline and get a lot of tools to eat bottom side of the map to be able to win out and I think that you know if game 1 of Easley it wasn't successful became number two was and now that puts a lot of pressure on rookie because he is so you might need to smash it when I'm in the car to pick and with your bottom line going poorly if they lose control. We have the potential for retail if you know all those alarms going going into the midline from bottom light this time even more successful at doing that yeah definitely agree and I think it is encouraging for the side of Fanatics I think I hate it doesn't always have to be about cats right you can have carry threats bro the other lane you can have a stepping up like you did in the first game you can have broxah having these incredible games to carry you through even against the top level of Moana and so certainly encouraging things for them moving forward toward those quarterfinals this guy is having a very good tournament as being definitely the best jungler in this group I was saying she has released a lot of pressure with some tomatoes definitely get stuff from him and of course is one of the newcomers to fanatic he has been huge for this squad and let's see what can be next for these players we know they're going to the quarterfinals that question is that what's the in with her but it will be before that drops will be there right after the game's conclude so we'll know these answers very very soon do separate ants coming in as tax is trying to subdue is Midland Magic once again has had to Blind Pig gets rookies never had the chance for a fair fight every single game he's faced offered to get Tyler picked every single timer to get this BS lead the cast is very good at losing the minimum not usually giving away kills it against you come through often does convert have historically baton LeBlanc I'm paying back to when I had Arena was first Chinese around by they will get it was either early man has more magic things like hex Franco and potentially get better depending on taxes out of my vacation if he's will it really willing to invest in the one we want I'm going to try but double knockout Dracula doesn't have a way out and they will continue on the Badlands one more shot and killed a bit late but it still kills on the bottom side for fanatic broxup has been everywhere the start of this game making so much happen for fanatic at this time it's Restless who gets one of the skills which is huge for them without any teleport response coming down so this is going to be as real coming online soon as I need to find it when they came went pretty aggressive rat is a very nice boy book and I'm going to try now the topside level 6 going to interrupt the old even a flashlight but it's over the trade-in trying to make things happen around the map knows his team is falling behind so we make the play happen in the mid lane but had no flash off at end was a little bit low Roxas turn to make something happen here once again and they might have this one rookie rookie place with every opportunity he can go to turn around and go for it don't worry about it happening on this but you could say the rookie wanted that too if you want one more time so good Rome to make sure Pat Tanaka the worst for Gila saying what it is and outplay for rookie and Nick once again on the top side no flash from with low as well as sick as my from the cast and walked away in his life what is halfway there from with both going to go 1 V2 killed
