our team we're right for three players at their first time at a pro-level Nubian 64th and have a lot of title to the names as well but the top three like these are all the new guys and go right with this diving top wait till I get kills in a size like GTA Maryville right like a really really good you can have it right beside of them needs to grow up he's right you can tell when people are talking about the Maryville Squad they were like oh that's really cool how Niles was able to join golden guardian and take a jungle duo with you that's what Lane is would love to do you know our eye blinking by jungle with you guys going to kick continue to can't male for me for me it is but I caught a quiz been in the spotlight for Golden Guardian so you know like you're saying talk him up because he is receiving their sprinkling through a nice interation in my opinion because iconic in the game yesterday so that he can he's very well equipped to use a champion today and then they go after some of the top Lane takes that were talking about piping up if Carrie Carrie potential here irelia from Revenge off of his performance yesterday meanwhile they don't want to let him take the Camille cuz I guess Brent doesn't want to play Jack or Ouroboros doesn't want to spend too much time there is convenia what's the champion. I like in him to the most of the applicant releases down the Comfort level some what it does mean the Olaf is up at the beer pick they got rid of the 7th at 6 a might have picked and that means that yeah you know there is I would say you Note 3 to 4 as you don't lose a lot of definitely one of them and then Premier and iconic who's the best performing play on Golden Gardens of getting an incredibly smart Pick 4 FL a hard time believing that we're in a world where is your Jungle Band ahead and go there like go ahead first take the whole lot of the times I have available and they're not a lot of great answers to Renekton if you wanted to do hey we're going to do carry style topside that would be a great pic early for Revenge doesn't look like going to invest in it quite yet I do still like it though keeping him back your mind because AP junglers have gone through the band face literally still available to Leah still available if you pick a red-necked in for that and you remember to charge up your Fury for your longer stud then kill combo and if so has not a single one of them his career so far even despite having some very successful run through Academy going to be the spot he's in pretty early on would not mind an early work on here and let dick say and do to get a lot done I think that if we're going to put a stack rank with it up from is a Golden Gardens are iconic and the bottom line I would love to give the Moore agency is trying to find winds early on keep in mind that in this year for LCS for 20 21 exist playoffs world right which means these games out right now for 8 days if there are going to be easier wins on on the board it games like this I want to see them influence at 8 go towards winter the game Pet Grooming in to desire interesting here for Mortals they are going to have a great fall delivery system you shock wave Attack Grill is always a great combination and you've got pipes me to follow up on it I would say they're probably looking at it you know. And attack tattoo yet instead of instead of bottom land then set up the desire and cut off the global at the source which I've always been a big fan of the strategy going to start a global sell-off while TF is really strong right now and you can enable your side lance that he might be taking a bit of extra Focus here has got a lot about on the bottom side stop playing Focus continues my friend yeah I expect Mortals to go for counterfeit there it works really well for event last night but if any of you heard how far is interview earlier today talk about you know the reason they lost three Mortals was there a little too cocky the Canon in D really went into him it went badly and throw horse Renekton is being is being left up here still and and that feels like unless you're willing to do Quinn which actually is so maybe they're they're leaving it up as I get really nervous even if I'm the team at picking you do a hard capture like like Quinn that if you die if you lose jungle pressure there so many things that can go wrong with it but not now we're getting right down to it both of them left up Immortals not going to show their head first and we get to see is Niles going to go for it because of bands at Top Lane Niles Niles is got the blind pick so they got rid of his Camille is comfort and the two big range tops that you can blind in NJ sand narf will Niles go to paint Duty or released y'all come to my land where do we get there but whatever the great, I'll get my eyes really are on what you got I was going to take cover pick instead because he's he's self-proclaimed best GP and this is something he goes to Blind Pig all the time you need to pick it right up and we do get the ivern you could if you really wanted to flex those two right now and it's still switch over to Jungle a neck rub the top side but I'm expecting it to be that the topside I ran into GP he he can Farm out towards the Moonstone be a great team Fighter for the squad's this Immortal team fight is looking beefy Golden Gardens better get on that Twisted Fate Ablaze Olive your first ultimate your second ultimate you got to be proactive with this you got an Olaf jungle and a Twisted Fate mid those two how to get stuff started before this group that Immortals have constructed here with Crazy amounts of filled with double solo Lane shielding Champions is is able to bring them and apply them to the acronym alright worldwide this is the fifth ivern top pic of the year it is currently three and one of those wins over in the LDC well one of the wins and losses Wonder Woman on it crazy lost but it is going to be fun to do this one come out this is this is what we like you know what just kidding we're not we're not doing the skill check top lame we are playing support of God we're all right and we're out what's going on at the utility that you do get for it is going to be all about this this team fight for Mortals they're building their cop send it around this so we're going to have our eyes on the early objective priority towards the bottom side of map with those dragons you don't have to send any juggle attention up to the top side to further I burn actually one thing that is often overlooked for the I've learned is the amount of extra damage you get from your pasta for being and brush and so even though you permanently has ranged attacks now you don't have to get into breast for rain to text you it's still really really heavily utilize for top Wayne to get that extra damage because you're Early Trades are actually significant with it and it and it does allow you a decent amount of control up there so basically just you know if you don't have to apply much attention and then try and group up for later all right just being a course this little late and you can't attack gold Global GP to make it look better cause of very explosive land of course or you can go top and Byron going to be alone without much support and not all of them. Things out for me to watch for the Immortals very much a team fight Wombo composition is there insanity and Rays going to be there for all of the damage with some support for the Iran and okay is there going to be anything spicy here hoping to maybe do it. Ideally they looking at Force the tribez person over toward the recondo so they work on can men W knock up over the wall and Mortals suss it out nice defensive movement from Revenge watch back way early into the correct brush Instead This has become very common that I've actually started here multiple secret names for that exact opening play I do I repeat all of them actually I don't I don't think we need to go down that path but the idea is always you try and find all the the enemy top laner from the tribe us to run towards your CC Champion doesn't have to be work on anything with a long-range cc to fire over the wall it is become so commonplace though that it's expected now and it's nice to see the defensive opening their from Mortals seeding grass I'm back and ride off nobody with any of the fish in here to start out Smart Buy Revenge we did see they learned and his okay what's the normal time in here what's it going to do sit in that brush but good burn and he's going to get the grass off as well extra q and that is a trade advantage health potion for Revenge he's going to feel comfortable with more things to craft a potion and Rebecca be careful he's not quite a lot so fairly reasonable but yes there is going to be you no more XP more gold or early pronounce we first little to do with the extra passes damage so you see Revenge using the brush twice kills it early so I can get the extra damage he drops back in every few Autos to be able to replenish its butt dials trial by fire for Gangplank if utilized that you can go so aggressive early on grass Q's as well coming through no problem delayed control gain but they should know it was a bottom Stipe start freezer say they feel a little bit worried nice stunt as well but you know how do you Auto e almost gets you there couldn't quite get salt in the lambo still a solid trades or say yes going through a pretty full cleared to take prompt as well so go to the entire Jungle by the rev up towards the Crux to buy sometime you might want to take time to get you want to make sure that confused a stacked for the cooldown pretty solid underneath the truck and push in 3 ways than recall play allows him early doran's blade and just take that relief first recall to walk back to Lane the kind of camps over close next to the other one by the way should be standard practice on any jungler that doesn't have some sort of clear mechanic that requires you to stand still I can't emphasize this enough when when you see jungle clearers often times that the people falling behind in the races these autofill junglers are once I just stand at the current Camp Auto attacking and using their spells on the thing to death it does save you a significant amount of time to always least your Camp over towards the next one the crop up towards wolves wolves over towards mid so you can get the Raptors quicker literally all of them cuz travel time is such a big deal when you're when you're clearing your jungle move speed is so important for junglers and and that should be something that especially people who are auto-filled into the role can actually gain a lot from give it to your laser didn't do it actually kill and make it through teleport even though I don't play with people on TV very often so I don't know for certain not quite sure either I don't think so yeah I know the TP I imagine there's no way that works in in length appreciate you can't you can't mail the menu with it yeah right back down there for the for the Olaf and he rushed the tier-2 Lucidity boot for the extra cooldown reduction by the way we have felt very very very rarely see the rain support items on wreck on you so often see what she'll be says you don't look this matchup not afraid of any and gave it all I can always get a way I can fix a we want to play aggressively I want to order your turret you learn used and so far it is working to see if they can XIV they're smashing bottling truly are and you know I didn't really hear you the first time we talked about so ridiculous 6 that way it should be able to get in here goes down all right that is why it's so risky to just kind of blind go for one of those dragons especially ocean Drake slows you down to do much damage not six
