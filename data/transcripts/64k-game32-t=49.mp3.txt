you took that one and that's obviously a sign of very good things for them you talk a lot of European analyst g2r probably forth in the power rank the who's going to win World right behind that triumvirate so far and undefeated run is a good start from the Before Time in a row raining LEC Champions and yeah you've got more Dornan shed and they already banned out too so we'll see are they just going to actually triple van in and try to force impact off of that try to make him show something different and that is the case they're think in fact you've got nothing triple band on him and wonder is going to look to dominate we will see if in fact pain no rise to the challenge he has been known throughout his career stats on those kind of stepped up his Blake international events and he's going to have to be able to do that here today as Wonder with a smile on his face walking in the first pick Renekton with the three most play for impact already off the boardspell Alice at the world championship group stayed so far Volver going to be a champion that impact picked up for the role of hadn't played it up until two days ago Baisley Boulevard them to the answer the top link Canby play Jungle of course for Brock's Auto I'm still expecting of toppling will see now what else do you want to play most played so this is a flex pack and I mean if it does end up being in this is a completely reasonable matchup for in backseat going to have to wonder how much did you to accomplish with those first three bands know maybe they feel like it really is a huge drop off in performance for impact down on this volibear but we'll see if he can hold up in that matchup because we have seen a lot of players playing this match up and doing just fine on the vale but that being said he look right now is going to have to find engaged elsewhere right without the shed without the orangethe champions of people feel like paper over some of the weaknesses that team liquid has and I do think especially now with rocks on the grave there is a huge amount of pressure on cor-j day to be able to find a champion that can be the engage 14 liquid while also not getting blown out in Lane fight Nicki X and perks well talk about getting blown out and lay in a course that's a pretty strong leader good at pushing but not incredible all in Champion we were talking about the possibility of twitch coming back in the lineup when you're not against a raisin or being Ritz vegan cinnamon craving a lock-in regardless and one for each of these teams because roxa in gancos first played it for the first time all year yesterday the day before in the group stage Keene on fanatic and gancos hadn't play hits of 2016 on h2k brought back into their pool because she's so highI do think that the callista picked year is to help to an able to engage I talked about that's going to be necessary from corejj there are a lot of options you can go with alongside Calista Calista thrash I think it's the most obvious one is also a strong Champion record JJ if I'm G2 that is probably getting banned out how you also have the options of things like a clitoris can you have Alistar you have tarek as a combo Leona there a lot of options that really can't be enabled by this to lifted white even more aggressively Leona going to be the one concern coming out this far with Tom gets banned out you know that does make me feel like you're they may be looking toward the thrash but it'll be interesting to see if it actually makes it through Big Ben the address but that one as well also curious to see what comes through at the Midland match-up is one that very clearly both V2 in tlr trying to save her as late as possible he'll be in a red side means they get ultimate did on counter pick and let them go blind if it was going to work very well and if you saw those are the facts green graphic during countdown it's been kind of a rough road for TL so far if you can bounce back there was a syndrome that was very very likely she's been a premier pick at the worlds group stage so far in the mid length will see what he's going to play for himself in this month and I'm expecting them to save last pick for Jensen because that match up he's going to be so critical yes you do gain an advantage by picking for that bottom line as well you know they're going to go for something like more generically Oriana you could do that Alyssa another pic that you know that can work very well. I think his could go to Denson but it doesn't feel like his style of Champions so I am assuming this is the support for corejj I will say that supports that really not very popular in a General Lee statue he have some success with it but really across-the-board no one was playing it ever since it got some of those nurse a while back who is it is a more aggressive option looks like she was going to go with the J Schmitt so very early game Focus, pure they're looking to smack Lane use the Renekton to Jason Italy to push in to get priority enable yankles to get aggressive takeaway jungle camps ambroxol add more on that back foot and Oriana not a surprise here at all if it does get locked in for a chance and that is really his bread-and-butter Champion I would say this is this is a pretty reasonable well-rounded composition here for TL they are going to have I think some trouble in the early game if they are not very very careful. There's a good set-up you know both in bought and top for than Italy special sick the a hero's can be very deadly and Jace can look to get really really aggressive on to this Oriana in the early game so will be interesting to see where they get priority in and what bracha is going to try to play this game like because I do think Abraxas going to need to step up his play try to be more involved in these Lanes yes he has been spending time in a warning for protecting those lines but I think you either have to go more strongly two words of power forming a strong leader so I can carry fights or ganking more often so that he's having a more direct impact on those lines yeah I do want to see him to show up a lot more in the early game Yankee on the world stage has been a delight here as well as second Italy game since 2016 and he is the only magic damage on the roster look better on the team liquid we got for the first to see all games was that they had gotten too heavily out drafted both times this one at face value looks a lot more equal and we'll see if the actual then play of their 5 instead of against G2 who's obviously the European team I think in the history of League of Legends you can maybe put a nap if they're for fanatic with the 2011 World titles World final MSI Champion like you are the Deep Run out of the LEC Team Liquid here looking really good so far and taking down soon as you already said that game was absolutely incredible I hope that where you are in store for a competitive one here today I agree I do think that seals draft is it completely reasonable I think you know if you turn name plates off you know a lot of people be very very happy with that TL draft do does come down to the execution Penzeys players step up and match the level of play that is going to be shown here from the European Champions a lot of packing to be answered then North America if you look at the last one game they have 100% win rate in the world champion take it if you look at 80% VLT D2 and this is a match that is a a rematch of the fastest best-of-five any of us have probably ever seen the MSI 2019 championship team liquid took down raining World Championship g230 TL as fast as you can blink your eyes and now we get the rematch here at the world championship to close out their first round robin of this group here at World twenty20 Del Rio in a few days time that'll be exciting there as well but TLC get a chance to shake off all of the malleus people have thrown at the LCS off of the rough group stage start off of TL themselves mg2 in their most recent best-of-five and we'll see now in this one if they can shake this off until you let invades Italy Spotify Turks and he walks away so I will see if if Jensen is as well caps rexha going to move down but nice. Does land and I mean I don't know how heavily they want to commit I think it in a drawn-out fight it should go the way of TL but they're getting poked down and look like flash is first part 4 tactical and a red buffer Brock's clothes and the red buff together this might is landed there by broxah and G2 I think they had a much weaker level one but I think they were depending on the back that maybe tail with play that more slowly Landing boys you landed up Spears you post them down you win this might and maybe goes your way but this time it is TL starting out with an aggressive level one plan and it does work to their advantage tactical also gets the kill witches cute are we have seen him dominate on Calista before you his playoff performance on it one of the best one benign style kind of 80 karrie performances I have seen in a long time and we'll see if we can replicate that exact year against me to spam out of Mickey X in a little tooth comes in first for the TL side across portege has a splash as well to start things off very important point it is Phase Rush Alistair I'm not always a big fan of it you aren't durable until level six that means for every single time he will do to the core JJ tactical re-engaged and very well. He's outstanding player I actually have a lot of high hopes for the support match of the ALCS MVP off the back of Team Liquid regular-season win on summer split making apps I believe was a top-three All-Pro voting number three I believe on the All-Pro team and just incredible part of the lect2 championship lineup as well as I feel like you know for G-tube Mickey ex has been a game again soon and I believe it was was incredible so he he really has been stepping up to the plate and no corejj I think without a doubt that the best player in the ALCS in FaceTime last couple years he's been really really crushing it quite a bit back right no processed old is he is going to get that 3 bucks and because this weight is crashing so much later it's not as though it's an easy. I like if you were going to do this this Renekton dually dive on the ball of are you would want to try to stack the wave and do it when you have to level three against the level to level four. That being said impact aerobics yes that's it honestly wonder is created a very large Advantage up there by himself and that is not from Jungle pressure you know they knew the Yankees was step behind that is just straight up from out laying his appointment was the one to already are you have to say those three bands for the impact are paying some dividends Ford you too but it will say despite the toppling difference with definitely is there and props to Wonder Man by Lana looking at the liquid Jensen is upset with a bigger wave to farm exact same boat for cat litter on the bottom side is he's got the previous lead now pushing back broth so want to be like for today turn the flash to get away and that is rocks a little bit too far off in good fun that was very poorly played by Brock said he have full vision of Mickey walking up you can just smoke screen a man walk away you know instead he actually stayed try to get them David's down Mystic you that is unable to talk face rash to walk away so we actually have to force the flash out there so it take from Rasta you know that is going to to limit his progress if he can be highest farming very well but you know you have to be careful for looking for any plays about Flash for sure big chunk comes out of Wonder yankles now it's leaking around the brush there's a war though the lane closed nearly stopped vehicle and punch them down but it's going to fit through the EZ pick up there and Cutlass comes down for tactical no boots just yet for his side as we got them through the topside 14cs difference and I believe the top we will push toward welder exact it and it has it so it's going to slow push forward and that's why we walked for it and didn't get those minions allow them to stack up against a nice trade here at the back because he didn't want to be able to push this to anyone feel the pressure in Brockton do the cast is really low so that's why he's going for the baby's trying to steal with them pants to relieve pressure this is why I brought that has been criticized for is that you know when he is power farming he's power from his side of the map he didn't match up he's not going to his opponent's side has looked a lot better in the early minutes here no getting in the face of you and goes trying to relieve some of that pressure and we can be the G2 bottle and heading up towards that top side trying to look for a potential Rome play up here and it looks different now Jake Olson Team Liquid game he was holding the W in case you went in all of you to file didn't get hit by the Shockwave are from Jensen the easy Turn Around from for JJ the W across the whole Squad G2 everyone up to the topside spend a bunch of Summoners and loses a liquid are looking really good in the early minutes of this game right now the Savior a G2 is still wonder up in the top side Force teleport down with you can't show up the end of the other fights for a while but still doing it right oblique impact up the topside Rock in the jungle lead feel safe going to beat the red bumps like big but I make you a little while ago no problem with might got to be close to 6 and finally as have to go get to level six so it's okay I will finally be fine with corejj occasionally there's a reason to switch the champion if it's really interesting situation might as well be your selfie option obvious one don't get some support to get it but middling you got to say is going well for Jensen as you said you saw the staff analyst and having the world championship that you
