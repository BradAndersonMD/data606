champion and him merely winning Lane vs ornn and having The Stand United Team Liquid the first 20 minutes of the entire game yesterday versus CLG and I feel like that strategy versus golden Guardians 18 that fully Embraces the mid lane roaming with Demonte trying to play around closer invading out of the jungler if Team Liquid are allowed to get Global Bike shed that's a perfect defense to try and counter the golden Guardian style fashion averus FBI Vera specials in open pretty long known as a family has been very good and that's the hover already feed liquid trying to deny some of those marks pain from him put him down to a baby and is real or a Calypso or something else and of course that shame as you mentioned not Bantu way probably not stolen by concert is going to be full of God is not able to fly exactly what they've been doing a lot of reasons and again in factHauser into orange to be able to have a very easy Lane phase where you can also shove it up and have Lain pressure in addition to being able to use the globals definitely be there the bottom land of Israel, I feel like it's so annoying to deal with defensive poke long-range to CSE super offensive now we've got basically woke up Landing Modpack use on tuna paleo slain just kind of the way that you want to play the early game so I think golden Guardians to invest in some pretty good Mouse overs from Team liquid soap some flavorful pics but I doubt they're going to lock you in you know this way in or anything like that and it's just good to be aboard the classic late-game scaling combination of Australia suorin but they threw in elyson in the mix up again for braxas most comfortable on and all of League of LegendsI'm looking at the golden Guardians Drax if it did not have to grab Azrael on a second pic right there they chose to get it despite seeing the evelio so they were trying to rush down to get the lease and they could have gotten that first pic do not to its death at wait and see what else can come through if they're not going to kind of pick top link they're not going to go for a blind Midland covered by the band both had very good early game little girl doing I would say yes better uncle just died of Rockledge and have play making tools all game locked and the thing that was talking about event golden Guardian further investing in this strategy I think they they've completely got it here with waiting on their jungle pick up are the reason you want to pick as you do when you don't have to and you're not rushing for a first pic is looking for what team liquid show first if you have foreign land on top side and a Bellows on bottom. Both of them blinded as far as matchups go from the golden Guardian standpoint you can invest very heavily in early game favorite answersat least it does have Mobility Advantage rate UPS man ever meet up you can taste them off of dective and at least it has to get tricky and try and no usable Billy the ski lift or Flop King's first but by seeing the rock the lock in beforehand to Golden Guardians now half that's very heavy Poclain bottom line with an Olaf jungle that can go down there and control early Dragon make a try and win souls before Team Liquid versus orange pretty good scaling their unique champion in Hens game of Orange Grove mordekaiser X1 of pics to Champion pools incredibly wide and I think you have weight gain with your back bite marks with a big tank up. But we've got a counterfeit top length we're going to free form u4 golden tail give me one of the carries I think Hunter has been a lot better this Flippin lastit's still a dominant man has stepped up it's a big factor how cold it better to me in this place is Orrin which is one of the very few matchups that kale actually get picked in competitive League of Legends right now is because you can get your tail past the early stages where she's basically a fledgling of a champion and get your excited to get to your extra range for the champion and I wanted to see more team putting their top winners Disney's carry positions so coming off of a Sunday Camille pick this is really exciting the trend that were not saying in North American League of Legends I like the little bit of spite their added by Team Liquid solute are there at LeBlanc pick and it's immediately countered with Saturday to fold counter in Lane face trying to AOE the wave and get your Wave Control and use your teleport to get right back to the Wayne after first purchase but later onsee the LeBlanc and put a stop to any type of hope that you tried to go in on your name for a second game in a road diesel block flying under right now to get off scot-free pack go to be loaded stronger as you mentioned go to the match up at all so that means it's one of those lights off of clothes are doing Ward hotcakes and knocking people in and then you had the Monday following up being a second and more often. It was closer leading the charge. Lee walking some people until it down two axes but the the hard engage not really only on damontay here will I not be as real and kale to be a kind of another threatening backlighting Pulte liquid into them but I always am going to be a little bit concerned when there's not you know the most the easiest engaged without their own lysandra can sometimes be too little when you get a chance of going to be dedicated disciple and an impact Advanced recovery needs to so I normally and fully onwith that but there's one thing here when you have a kale on an Olaf team it also turns the olop into another option for the late game which usually falls off very heavily if if the guys can get closer some early money having the kale later also brings that extra looks to your team comp where the Olaf gets to charge it as a juggernaut and start the fight as well with knowing that have that long immunity to create chaos within the enemy team and that's why I'm very excited to see this this mostly LPL and lck pick where we see Calles picked into a horn and try to scale from the easy early Lane that go against against it into seeing what Golden Gardens can actually do because it gives you multiple options you can keep fight with it you can also play your side length later with it very effectively jungle pathing right now you're going to see solo starts in the blue buff for both drunk lose your baby or it comes down at least a little bit but not required both used junglersvery good at taking their own camps and standing up by themselves means a dual lanes are going to be sitting there at the Lane right away if they want to do FBI who he could have pulled us into a freak and if there was Elisha M. Pease you like this yes. Me to Casey Randstad clothes are easy going to solve the blue goes on Prop afterwards if I could just a little bit if you want to want to point out to lunch answer is becoming more and more the count pick up here it's guaranteed golden coming out to expose yourself to try to help make you get the vote for the golden come and makes it very safe and easy yeah I'm a huge fan of starting out and thank you as you can in support role supposed to because of what I planned it I get autofill that I need to her as much help as I could possibly get but I still think the Azrael karma is going to have pretty good folk advantage and should be able to know her ass tactical Encore JJ pretty well during Elaine Paige crush them under turret and set up for these possible Olaf dragon that we're looking for a cute does Miss there so that's a nice quote on windownot for courtagen tactical try and do something about but since it's level two for the golden Guardians no possible rebuttal and so far perfect CS4 FBI 1 million drop by tactical open the case when you're against the more aggressive of the two lanes going to have for today help knock them out of the melees of going to be just fine overall is an Oculus without much difficulty and Dominion go down back and forth and it's just the early plane crash Denali send are they good to know for certain there were no T4 is he could have done a red start Solo or a blue start solo so his actual location should be entirely Unknown by Golden Gardens would just be a guess there is some of the respect they have to pay because broxah could beat any Lane right now the game plan for Golden Guardians is very clear when Oak Demonte actually are going to have to try and leave around the minions good job there by 10 to get me the full combo and chain off behind minions in getting a big person Demonte but that's the game plan here because I really like looking at the early stage of the golden Guardians are trying to accomplish herewatch free one-v-one time for kale vs on if your kale does not get interrupted early and gets to scale up to the ascendancy range bonuses then didn't your goal is really complete for the top side and it allows closer to transition off of getting safety and vision for on Sir into fat bottom side poke into Dragon Focus for them so you see his priority really high on clearing up to the top side to get Scuttle crab and popping the scryers bloom which reveals that since the ground was already taken they now can assume the location of rocks that even though they didn't see him directly or you can kind of extrapolate and know that he has to have clear towards the bottom half and alert FBI and who he took the weight on a closes arrivalI think it's like a lens once again though. So slightly down in farm with more minutes for impact to kill so it's really late for Kayla never really is there putting clothes back and forth on Sat really talked about this one but hopefully not going to get out of this one impact health and Mana for a little bit low on so much simpler baby wants to recall before too terribly long the TV back into Lane maybe on his first you know bit of Triforce her first bit of racially or something like that either way Quizlet going down to wait there for Monte small midlane leave here for Jensen farmwise overall but a close gameyeah number one golfer how to get to level 6 first so you really get start playing bottom side they do get pushed in so cord to 10 tactical taking their window opening at see what car did they can do with its bar if you could get any sort of vision he acted in a movie there newborn baby this one right here this is one this the last non-canon the wave like a du-rag on a hard shove one wave and then recall without having to bring TP which Appleton have disk is the way if you spend all your mana on a Wii stuff down we're seeing clearly stated last week. So those would like as not give me the timer where I think pretty close to BSR time like if Taco Bell sitting well and I believe he was this would be the way of your last hit graphite yes or than recall backhand Lane and Castle going to end up missing that opportunity I think that is an unanswered by Azrael so this feels like a small missed opportunity that fit I'm sure he has a reason why and we might be a fly out here but you would want to push that we've been recalled yeah and it can't be affecting them with scales objective here having to use your early teleport to be able to bridge yourself until your levels be fixed because I was in for Gayle you get to your 525 Auto attack range where you then actually start to be able to do something versus the Oren and first by Berserker grief and mediate teleport back for hanser so the question becomes do we diverge and have monster walking back to Lane because of the necessity for our to me for impact walk back because of the necessity for haunted have to teleport there and that's a sun to queue winning half help call JJ with the invade their deep into enemy jungle they do catch them off Jensen's LeBlanc able to capitalize on it that is First Blood phone is over to Lovelock we could throw a wrench into the thing for both plans on Sidelines if you start to have Jensen actually roaming up in and trying to get those pills on the other two side land everything could slip for the golden Guardians Team Liquid get the objective afterwards as well very nice early control of the vision on Dragon in the river plus remember there's a Teleport discrepancy during this whole time when you have that the confidence of your top line or being able to join you can die very deep into the enemy jungle knowing that there is going to be an extra resource for you to use the court JJ proksa combining their to go to set up the kill for Jensen you know they get the gold of the ideal place as well and cordage a right back out onto the math with rocks are right behind him looking to get some more support jungle roaming action you mentioned earlier that pop when was going to report for Golden Gardens in troll Hunter is safe closer has several times now make sure he's gotten top scorer xtra-vision and make the room stop or the gate for the top from Brock said that much more difficult to answer has to go to safely farm with desert breeze it will run away from date the consumers the ideal first item on that you're really really am a champion as well so yeah he's going to be pretty safe up there closer wants to go back in they can BBQ on Brock's light is up for one or not because they were afraid of what the world might be there was nothing that hey MIT is missing didn't know they could have stolen that they could have taken the mid lane without much difficulty sponsor should knock down to Florida and if they can crash that Harold 300 ultimately be too on this flight going to make it hard for Jensen still looking around but can I have the keys to the Orioles down three Chase golden Guardians back now they're turning around there with the supports roaming over they pull off blanket defensively got to pick the gold is pretty much equal between the team across teams probably feels a bit equal up to the K-Love great on one side but it's hella failures or on the other honestly I was getting pretty excited I wanted them to fight that as well because even without lysandra ultimate if you type back for your cool down on W then you have a kale ultimate and Demonte can try and W root Jackson when he goes in for the pope and if you have kale Ulta
