some jungles are only words I know. I talked on his exit with tsmp the interview where he said that he was being kind of horse Klay play style he didn't agree with and it's really unfortunate that it continues to happen where it seems like TSM when I had them but speak his back and for what I heard they want to play with them that they think he has a bad showing and then he proved is going to be here I don't think that you can expect csm's birthday who represented with their level throughout the entire year of the last time the Boston beer can work in Duffield running a lot of chippy chips together yes that was a couple years ago, double is also in a winning on slot on Team Liquid so there are high expectations now that they are reunited again your auntie at them and we will see you know can they actually met as a squad and develop as they need to I do think one of the big concerns 40 at them though is is how Gordon the jungle roll it right nowand you have a completely unproven jongleur in Topeka right you know people people are talking about jungles the most powerful role in the game right now and we've been seeing go very clearly in some of these other games you look at innocent parents games look up flowers games are they are running over the competition you can get to a situation where the game is completely revolving around this Tumblr an invasive these sorts of plates do you need to have a concert to have a jungle performing at a very high level in that puts an incredible amount of pressure on Beka especially on TSM where there's already so much attention on that jungle rollers you say they always talk about Vietnam Jungle Earth revolving door there it's like the defense against dark arts teacher of League of Legends Britney's is always a discussion about them being made into word of this defensive player so because battling cuz all of that without really having much competitive experienceabsolutely nothing you need a player I've had like 50 in a jungle are like blabber who gets hotter than takes the entire waving inflatable recalling a zit popping is recalling friends again don't worry I'll I'll take as good as 50 gold and it's alright it's going to head be the force to change things around in its rewards right now supposed to be in Z being played and and even though it's the gates of rain where you know late-game farming is more important than kind of are a bigger factor in your team fights than before things I was going to lock in at set for themselves labor I can do for you on that one but we know can also Flex the jungle in sportDefine possible I wouldn't think it would be the Port Perry the Azrael those two deals, convery off the ends of the spectrum so now I'm expecting it to be going up to Viper we have been seeing a lot of set jungle lately and yes could you schedule. Alongside that Azrael Azrael Lulu all these sorts of tuna poke Lane of people are feeling or are working pretty well and if people have kind of I think I'm more comfortable playing those and Cancers and to a level where they're not feeling like there's going to get gang to die because that was always been as both the logic for playing tank oh no you can't be going up against EMF to me that is a very very strong bottom leaves does have the ability to really going to poke you out and then one that lane so I do think that could be as real Lulu bought late is going to be on the back foot early on here pretty heavily unless they can reallyLanding a lot of those music shops yeah I definitely agree I'm going to see if inside and left again Johnson after really do Lansing good poke in and even know just hope is not enough TV off deals that are easily so I'm expected you to look good on the bottom side so especially with the pedigree players like it wasn't biofrost I'm going to go pretty favorites in general I like to undo a whole lot in the jungle with the great band to be very easy. And feel good about you seem to lead them dancing through 12 are wisdom or Jungle Band inside you can actually be easier if you just hop right over the pillar and sometimes even take to get to the Trumbull as a result of that is if there's not really a lot of staff to actually steal from that can drive out those Marksman junglers can be very very difficult for the troll there are still stuff like Olaf if you can go with us but you know can be pretty rough when you're older than youcan you get focused down there are AP junglers things like ragus at least that he could go towards so I have to be exactly where Katie want to take us but you know with that with as real they do have the ability to go to work clothes at a beach with previously all right well at least I could be locked in your the Top Lane as the expected matchups into that set upstairs yes flexibility between set and it before but nine times out of 10 is it from toppling for Viper and broken blade back on the h-r octave lose two games in a row for him to try to win that sort of match that there's the Olaf hover definitely no high-priced Champion Acadian though they get about other apothecaries and not only did as imaginative lineup switch does not have a lot of right now but if they have that big beige and is going to be here in Italy you know what I was kind of expecting a p jungler this is obviously another option is there a newly also very strong I think in this current Meadow power farming jungler again you don't want to just be power for me you are side of map you want him getting in your opponent state power farming dare jungle to Italy has one of the fastest cleared of any Jumper in the game and does have the ability to always be able to get in and out of their phone would you like me to count jumping over the dragon ball dropping jumping over the Ritz-Carlton Bal to move in and out of these situations birchrunville can't really fracker don't get the Katy can get rolling you could really see him look at this dude have you been to the one B-12 should have you been to the clear to be not going to be such a lot of Reliance on him to kind of get things done TSM underscore key for their last picture with mid-length much more of a can of splode healing style of Pixar we have to be for Keith new workout very very well with you via that combo just do Jay and Diesel kind of gathered up in their first game to really really look good there in hundred music I do believe that was so that's a situation where we could see to get them looking kind of utilizes imfdb download to get ahead and bottom layer Leon then see Bob Ross moving and really kind of gathering up with your sin to utilize that combo for going towards Bleecker and Mystics game looks pretty good overall got a good will write a set of Champions if you do he'll want to stuff I feel like a monster and come with us to Asian wedding there, looks pretty good overall as well although it's hurting my eyes are on what they can do because that is no she's not actually very uncommon in the Summers limit of game around the world she still is very high variance Champion if you don't have to go to the provide very much is almost purely a damaged champ Majors like grits or Carthage that used to be popular AP junglers like well even if your behind on gragas you still got all the Predator games for the early game you still got the voice of Casper big stuff and I need to get one shot at least friends on Uno defile the Wild Wild n Out there or at least can be very feast or famine and into you know I like to know as a player and I want to see how that plays out on your side right it's because I'm trundle it is very hard to screw up on trundle even you are behind the Ulta tank you know I guess the opposing set and in this case you take some stuff back in after them pretty reasonable Throwdown pillar you all someone you're doing okay right you know you can also going to build and support itemization at the one caveat I will go is that you can do Builds on newly like Iruna cat goes into an athene's and you can actually do kind of more of a support of style of build your they do obviously have a lot of shielding already with the Lulu and the Oriana so if you're as real as having a really good game where you can be spamming heels with your things as Natalie on his asriel's giving a taxi there he's getting double shielded from this movie Warrior on a combo and all of a sudden he has Roku become so damn hard to actually knocked down it's already a very difficult Champion to deal with that time that being said it's real not really that kind of trishul hyper stealing Champion that you really think of having all these passports in the pocket of I will have to see you I think a pretty damn good came out of Jonathan that's a really make this work yeah we had a ton of bands right clothes and family hosts were gone up to that right away the nearest as well soap yeah it's real heavy fries with you right now what is hyper carry Champion that you typically see all the buses go onto so have to wait to see what comes out of that one still can't do very well as you mention John has a good game he's worth supporting has been a decent player overall and it's going to be the pretty standards Red game start here sweepers for both the junglers but no Wards killed you're going to see that despite sweet being used Acadias get anything out of it he was looking up for that top side for a pixel brush Ward perhaps not able to find sorry I should I should fix what I said I believe you bought a war drop the whole freaking switched over and deal with 10 gold you get the 10 go through sweeping what smells last hit it come on man it's a really minor thing but it's objectively wrong maybe didn't even mean to Uno's but either way we will see how he can be able to go from here and you're right of course before the board then swapping the sweeper also worth noting that problem is actually playing FaZe rugs which I always love thee against rental in particular Final Four score he is not exactly the most depressing of the game combos they're very light on that pillar and the pillars slow and when you can profit is Russian all these you get to move speed increased a lot of people sometimes forget about know that the slow resistance right so you know it's going to make it so you can just easily walk out of a lot of those games unless you get completely burst out there just going to get the reliable golden Broken Blade right help kill the board with level 2 on the first wave goes in right away by hurricane ever fight back finally. Have some more abilities learned up but that is a very very good for a straight pipe organ or line is passive health regen of the doors blade not going to make a potion of a broken blade going for another big trade right. Good enough for him just text her name is a shin a little bit because that ain't I have to have something people kind of apple why are they going this right you know why it said how do you know which one to buy an end the way I look at it is kind of similar to situations requiring would have been good before where does more defensive if he's either too risky to do for you cannot consistently get that coke off to keep your selfies on cool down the whole time to go generation just isn't worthwhile right see you then want to go for the relics you know that they're still situations where they'll be some very very good again slower Rhett smillie supports for example of things like drama and very easy to actually bought that fact that Tom kench going to go for it but skip it was Heavy engage or that it is hard to get that poke off again like the fresh like the Nautilus or if it's better to just go Raleigh Shelton back up that gold medals so far to the early game as we look around the jungle and whatnot Topeka and Acadian tide in the camps clear does Acadian runs over the top and side and Look to You by the most common trundles near path by the way is do your entire jungle - Scruggs and then show up and fight for Scott on how to get to level four and usually when you're only one that's most of the Champions cuz it's that feeling 24-hour jungle CS overall is frogs are up but it looks like beer actually being up Farm on the nidalee is it out really good situation for the struggles that look like you're trying to go if you're on the top side whilst sphere but nothing's happening I side step by step the wind and the wave Loop 202 be as well as most of the way then he wants to recall there's the rest of it and hate you dang they built from the potion to CS count to be pretty blue cross tattoo of woman by forgets first three calls or even a broken plate laning looks really good he's ahead in this Lane exactly did the training doesn't really matter if you know unless you can get something from it in a winning trades is only good if you see a bit of that steep rock rock band Rush to get out the Flash's Bells run he was down just by poking Bjergsen and the day that a seminar down and and its calf Rocklin forced to recall a time that maybe you didn't want to go for lunch I'll do you say wedding in faith in everything becomes vignette it's by a doran's ring of buying apps home by some consumables and yeah he's about 300 short of getting you know the first big house like if you wanted to be does prioritize them the double door and was dead, just the pieces of that lost chapter you know clearly wanting the most power now still feeling like this before so that you can see if he's going to be going for this year built hear something kind of similar to when you see a drill just grab keys at four this year news actually just grabbing pickaxe power know my God by Pearl Jam lead he was level 5 broken plate haven't bought any items the damaged just wasn't there off to the tower dive in it completely blows up in his face he does not uses w there like he had a life I'm not sure if it was still on cooldown but 21 Auto auto write it just like okay I'm going to call you in a minute twice twice then W and poops too much damage do so much damage early on especially when you haven't bought any hbr armor you are going to get absolutely roasted by those turrets and that's a big mistake honestly from Viper to die like that without fee fee you do can be pretty rough situation thank you for him at least he did have to waive shove out who will be able to get back in time and actually collected in a little bit of class you're onto a gabion could be trouble that will not go away and there's a Shockwave forcing speaker to get out still got a point us because gup to flashes for one face this game so far acadians on the chase can't land the chat without the eggs are still good give me away from that one
