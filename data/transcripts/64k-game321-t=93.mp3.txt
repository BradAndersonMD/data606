today and their back to their old roster and meanwhile experiments have settled on this roster and it has been working pretty darn well they have the to a weekend last week with a pretty tough schedule and they are free in one with this current generation so that is very good especially compared to their overall record and a jongleur blabber has been very aggressive he has been playing very well looking for is a morbidly getting wins against both getting with over TSM and I bought with stinky play Queen on both games was pretty cool to see their own cake on board as strong right now and Nikki or I want to watch 46mm bands coming through I think the sort of focus on 590 super interesting again exactly this current iteration of the roster is 3 and 1 in considering the only veterans on this team are Jensen and sneaky licorice flavor in Sayville all had their lcsd used this year and if Weidman record in that small sample size pretty impressive knock them pick upwhy we're going to see how that one can go spots on their side do back-to-back zero two weeks they definitely did they really do I mean if they want to make it blasted they want to make it to Worlds they need to start doing some of these winds and about nine and similar boat I mean there's a lot of teams that you would expect to be sitting pretty in summer Split near the end of the schedule one of them have a long story history of success in the NLCS but they are 5 and 7 of they are on the outside looking in at a possibility of world's going to go pick the gym as the available bus going fishing again before old school for aggressive rock on TV and getting Picks Against The Stables Champions be very very good and said 20 to get more potent Poison. Control stated by Zanesville on the supportwalk inside 1e and if you can answer that fairly well keep this Jen safe against against the roof from the Sia guess is Ronnie L Smith in looking pretty good we'll see how blabber is going to perform on the Nocturne which has in a very highly prized Champion throughout competitive play a mean it's one of the highest van rates in open up and then I grabbed it in mediately second phase advancement through Gangplank about to go to a cloud nine with make their Force Band of the game and I'll wait to see what comes through we have much at the previous game the same role pick in the first round both solos waiting to be seen Zoey to come around going to be a face to ban for Cloud 9 1 / 2 event do I think has been largely pretty good on the champion is most played though is Wayne and that one still so faris it be able to be play good look for that if he wants to go that direction and I think I can beat fairly good at into what fun is showing already is another word for not really actually Converse down and get on to build naturally to do near as I can be pretty disruptive and thank you in the front line and kind of free space for that's Tire on to really work their magic in the late game he bites you comes to print you a lot more cuz right now but I'm throwing a lot of good split push power right content Brinkmann over knock knock the old thing to a side lane and if you want if you want to play like a Fiora or something up there that we just sit there. Last week you are the same. Have a good support for that to make that back if I could go very well of course you can turn it on his head on the flip side though they're a good bunch of heavily out damaged gin and if I'm 15 fighting cho'gath I can withstand length of wasp and Frontline first though750 splitfoot I wouldn't say you want to pick up your style mash-up in the Top Lane could go for a Buddha also is available that's going to be easier answer as far as this one that has some lien priority in the sidelines play a Jensen could drop by mid laner also and then have a little bit more of that threat as you said Oriana could be something that is pretty strong or Jana and Nocturne are a very powerful combo and he's going to give you a lot of steam pipe damage in the later stages the game Jensen as a starting mid laner not funnels half his game so far has been on Oriana's 3 on that one and away so could be gained number for here looking to kind of push together 18 V composition I think not quite as well rid of nose is zillion a new look here for Jensen wants to Blindin the mid lane and hope that's just have a mundo Bita everything forever making super fast in fact that knocked her and runs Celerity and giving him more boost be me to get even more attack damage there's a lot of small Synergy Seeker that be fun to watch for and there is indeed that's way from Heaven play was that that prompted that has yet to lose on Oriana to split it is his most played all time can be in one of his best game I've ever actually never lost any exactly 5 + 1 zillion also was very impressive but if you get the late game 5 E-5 can you actually match up and be able to to punch through a big swing with his own is in this a 20 until got to do that is not the highestyes and then Nocturne really wants to be kind of diving on a squishy Target and not dealing with that Frontline so yeah it is the concern there but if you get a heads-up that no longer matters but we'll see what they can do I do want to speak to run with a bit more of an interesting game plan in this one because I grew up in the Batman v does not look C9 favorite but they have been on a very good run right now three and one with the roster of Azazel and bladder in the lineup the New Edition from the previous split here in Rockledge gaining back to the starting roster but as rocks as done four and six so far the splits biggest 4th Place finishers have not looked as good as they did in Spring and capacities at best but open with a new look in a new week they can look a whole lot better quite a lot of comfort on this team lot of changes to know how to play Clash alone in last place I knew about quite well order the split both these teams dokkan turn their Fates around we'll see what they can do c9ty for 6 pick up in the standings clutch can come up that spot as wellbetter run of it recently this ties in the standings if clutch wins so I could certainly would love Scrabble win here going to reverse of the fortunes they have been having recently I worth noting some of the master choices here is lethal Tempo there for the Ziah which is going to be very effective is hail of blades jhin so again Africa and acting higher towards the damage and and left it on Surviving laying with things like Fleet footwork there's also going for a spell book and husband has become more more popular I really do think it's just interchangeable on any Champion that is going to go Guardian is his word you can also just go to spell book and have a little bit more utility but I feel like I haven't seen anyone use it super well so I'm kind of a little bit unconvinced on on how much value is having you generally as you pointed out in the previous game they grab a teepee they come back to Lane but mostly it feel like people are just sitting on their default Summoner and then it's it's that muchthanks guys I'm here with creating new coach for clutch you finish your first champ select how did it go for you but I mean I didn't think I was too much of a big deal I was pretty nervous going on stage for the first time but I think once I got out there have all the nerves going away and business but wishing you the best of luck thank you back to the desk if we go we'll see if but when does Game Theory is officially so sickly the best pink bandana list of all time on defeated in Fresh Meadows only result time it is nice to see another a new coach on the stage andfighting for him to be able to get up there and make it happen if you are on level 2-4 this Jensen stealing but right now bit down in farm as you expect for a push what are the two on two level two is going to be pretty closely tied but I was going over to right here for a clutch and you can see that goes about 9 to go to the naw, not quite damaged and I still trade is there now they are down here on the bottom side of the map as well but not sure that the lady is really going to be in a spot where he can actually feel pretty gangster zillion is very effective is far more items for CBR it feels really hard to pressure the champion at a very much so can cuz Wayfair endlessly flapper is level 3 though in it for the bottom sides of this makes it pretty difficult actually get in there nice spell she'll do anything to be a force flash out and I sent the game can good time and everything else right there and really waiting to cast a beetle after the clock hands passand then it's time for the routing portion of it and I'll blabber will be going ahead and grabbing this site without really any issues almost guarantee none of those forces of flash because if you get hit by the sun there you're going to get food out of that and then you may be getting broke down so your sexual flag from 7 good job I've learned density of the group up in and make that work in what is the Toronto from Midland Nocturne zillion not the dynamic do you think is going to connect group up in and get that early kill but hey the force of The Flash early they returned they get that kill no summers use either by 5 if it's a really good bit of pressure here I from laverge engine only down one Camp right now for the cost of a gangsta me through soBrothers Nocturne op 400 go look at it to under the bottom Lena is pretty equal trade of farm and the top slide also only plus or minus three licorice did get kind of a year we want to thank you again though set up a time or place to slow it really makes it almost impossible to actually Dodge especially in the later stages the game with that float and go up to 99% and set up there with no flash on. Washington DC not active this early in the game so really not much you can do to get rid of that one 40% slowed but still enough to make sure the bombs can land and almost all situations when I sit down and not quite that you could have been needed a date for a while and I didn't expect you to be the one going to prison you could give at 8 if that's been is down flash maybe he should be playing no more towards the bottom side or more on we're jungler is or perhaps there should haveI'll bring their that's kind of what you have to look at it because the ones are already in that situation there's no way out but there are things you can obviously do in advance to try to prevent yourself from getting the situation in the first place in farming well he is still up some and in the farm department and it will be scaling up on this way and that he has had a fair bit of support on this way and I have to be back in Jensen actually himself walked so still have that one aside land sometime down the line still left in the camp difference in the jungle Uso still good job to blabber getting to GameStop and keeping up in crime against the wind is Brian about Lee not going to land it but it said I should be good to follow through a seeing-eye side and then if we are now a juul in the river is not quit going to get the spear alive still that means they actually get to schedule control in fiber will be able to grab another shuttlecraft feel as it's actually a lot of experience a lot of gold in these early stages and that is becausecould come up knowing that Jensen is going to be the first actually Roman 2/4 are Lyrica not fighting really those advantages that he kind of gave up that are now coming coming back him and helping him out but not until 6 right now going on for climbers up to right now if it's raining tacos quit going to get any kills but yeah well off the lane and Weber didn't get fish wife by himself but nicely responded to the dive was good here from Cloud 9 but the TP Wards you're not in place really in time for liquor to join with the rest of the squad and it's actually watch that responds back of this is the Acer Predator replay here sneaky devil have them chunky low The Flash mask their Bible ever goes in able to get one filter able to chase it down and going back in but if you can see who do not actually answer nearly as quickly toward she was there so we could ask EP there of the TV is also available for Jensen not sure if he didn't think you needed to join or maybe didn't he could join but had both the soul enters TP do that laneworth for cloud nine I think that fight was massively differently being silly and also someone who do is there a lot faster maybe straight up win. On that play slow but it went so fucking actually the first blood and it was going to kill in the beginning to teleport down make it later on in the massively ahead up 7 Pharmacy equal TP uses for his help a student really goes down anything and is Rich yeah I mean I think if you're on cloud nine side you're happy of where those pills when not that they were giving up but at least it is not on festival at least it is not on Apollo those guys he's really would be more worried about
