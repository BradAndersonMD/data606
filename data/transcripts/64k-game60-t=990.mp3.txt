there but all the teams are alive and we'll see which team to go to sneak at the very end right now we have two teams who are locked in the playoffs Evil Genius and hundred thieves all right so right into it and once that's was talking about Top Lane Champions obviously that's always important with you know players like someday and hooty hooty already on the band fear this has been very easy for complaint against Evil Geniuses Gangplank Rumble Visa are always the Champions that you associate with him because those are the ones who performs on and it's still true this split we start Evil Geniuses is Kenan game really rough with his flanks is Camille game even worse as he got sold out by Ann orellana so right off the bat Hunter these Banning away the rumble lot of feedback be left up the Gangplank to their own detriment and his heavily for it all righty tighty off of getting rid of a lot of aggressive strong laners being notoriously has a very very small champion pool is very small. Cuz it is a point people keep on bringing up and bring up these points a lot with players even that we have had long career that long stretches of success with multiple murders yes bank has played only a few Champions failures as real but those are the champions at the top of the teeless 480 carries and I don't think it it speak to hey Bank can't play other Marksman what do you know this is one of the guys that's been playing the game for we will no longer stretches that we have had in professional play I think he's they're just following the tier list it's it's not really restrictions on him as a player thing right because I totally agree that you know if you take us to do this to you he's he's a big members of the highest but every other 80 carries well okay if I could play as real as Varys Game of us was the best day to carry I have a pic today but talk to you lady Carey play syndra here and then he didn't properly lost that's what I was there right with you anyways I can see the prove it yet cuz we have to see how well he did but the point guard for an anyways if I still could be a flex by the way I have actually played a game with Hootie top Calista and he dominated on it yeah you know that's so cute anecdotal evidence on a flex tr8 very easily cancel play solo Lane even have seen a few people playing at midlane so keeping the door open their hearts with these obviously don't think that could be a champion I don't think it is either and they're going to ban out some of the Golden Goose tile at longer range control Mage has he had a good as your game where he carried for them yesterday you know by the way man who needs healing solo queue that's good I like that Kobe off the table Sunday yet or Advance against hundred thieves as we saw from crumbs on the envelope says indeed somebody is a 0 and 3 on the pic give this man of fighter XIV of these are on right side they can save counterpick for someday I expect a blind bit later here for Ryoma right now so is still up would be a need to pick for him will still come through and as you mention the cliff that can be flexible enough to bend down there as well honey G getting rid of fighter toppings or something yeah and I think everybody is kind of on the edge of their seats hundred the saving Red Sox Pick 4 Sunday that's what teams want you know when you're looking at a hundred deeds and especially since they have in Italy you expect really high pressure Lance now is a Galileo locked in hundreds of bullies that up for very high pressure contract jungle trying to invade with Italy and multiple Global's to back him up so easy right now since they have to Blind their top laner for uni they just need to get some some lanes that you can have pretty much all purpose strong Lane faith in my opinion cuz that's what they're going to have to defend again and now is the moment of truth is it going to be a spell Elaine Calista or is that indeed Banks pick as we would get am kind of see in Spanish through the top 5 is a very safe blind top laner it is going to be calistic game of the split we know we can play it want to see if you were alongside Zazzle has pretty safe a chip in a lot of cases can withstand a lot of Fighters with the Dodge Zone animated Camille going to come in and set the Magnolia is very strong is the Bible top when I think we're going to see exactly exactly the question that I was supposed Evil Geniuses who I'm talking about super high aggressive playstyle from hundred thieves trying to invade in Jungle Dennis perfect you have a global you can answer their Global's with you can use defensive Stand United or you can use Stand United extremely aggressively with thrash Graves invades and that is what I want to see from Evil Geniuses the big question mark for me Corky for goldenglue generally they're going to try and farm up early will have a pretty easy Lane vs galio but when he gets the package 8 minutes I want to see EG completely change perspective here if they need to play aggressive off these packages time them with the dragons the timer's perfectly steamed up you basically have 5 minutes cuz it's a 4 minute plus adoration is one extra minute and that's how you should be able to win the game yet and the Foresters even Asian delivery system right if you really want who needs a note on the go to glue he died in the back line to deliver Shen back there you get an EZ Dodge you get any to taunt needs to feel good about that one and I'm kind of happens what what comes through here for EG we know they're going to be fifth or sixth seed in playoffs no matter what best they can fight for seating but we know they're up a bracket the question now is what form are you in when you take on a first-round opponent be at 90th samor flyquest think they're only possible first-round a you got to get ready for that matter cuz that's next weekend and you're gonna play best-of-five how good can you get goldenglue was awesome yesterday one death where he said they were sending the Top Lane and unit rate his here he is again on Corky another backline high damage champion in a year and in a gallon to see if he is on for because of Cordon Bleu is playing at that level is a very very scary team with retinol 3 length of golden glue goes back to you know Springs put golden guardians or early where he he can't have a consistent performances than EG look a lot more Mortal so I want to see what can happen on this quirky me know how to decide we know they're going to be on the lower bracket side waiting for their first appointment I don't see if they can get ya and once again they're taking the Natalie something must have happened in scrims because we got like three already this last week and the team's still have been kind of struggling with fully utilizing the Champions get really getting the most out of the counter jungling and the speed claim with a champion did Italy also of course is going to bring the kids later for a little bit to stain and can possibly set you up with poke but I think the thing they're trying to highlight is galio mid lane plus the aggressor Italy this is something that hundred thieves did when they first put in contracts they are able to get Ryoma the galio which is a perfect Champion for him supportive to the more aggressive players on the team and we get to see someday play the champion belt lost them their game just yesterday where it was Viper on the Camille do you know played Camille into some days or three items that got to ignore the tank and split push to victory in eventually eat eventually had a drop that game this time around someday is on the commune style everyone expect out of hundreds he's all year long you got one of the best top laners in the world on a lower half TV else in this guy is your wind condition it has been the case back with their first wedding splits or at least two regular-season it's the case here still at 6 and 11 Sunday is the man to look at and he got the chance to do it Sunday is also a very good take glare at has her a history of being a good team player most people do agree with you as far as the team doesn't have many other players at his caliber they have no they don't want to use him you're in a damaged dealing position also their game yesterday had a lot of other things I mean what is a 6 and 11 teeth there are flaws in hundredths he's right there not a perfect team two players are not on Sundays level into those why is Orrin in his bow kayak malfeitor all very good but he's got to carry this team and it's not just well my own engagement pretty good A lot of players can do that you do want to see a monster fish on a carry Duty so you know that is the point kind of being made I know you're not even supposed to make me different point there I just want to really clarify the stance that yeah someday caring is it site so maybe he's going for more of a full clear Natalie up towards the top side and then tries to put the map because who needs pulled with been scaring he's trying to give to skin a little bit of extra damage then actually gives a really good least as far as solo Lanes & Stitch go because of the Q start out and get a huge amount of percentage Health damage you can do to the blue so it really does accelerate the graves clear which is already quite Wiccan it since it's a no power for Members 1st power farmer match up with Natalie Graves we'll see if that actually can go a long way I just he's already trying to keep track of sense can you solve Ryoma on your mini-map there with a galio pushing up and trying to get in for a wart so they know he's out of fairly quick clip here on his clear down towards the bottom side and that should signal to Cody's son in whom they need their Wards up and they need to be fairly careful Graves obviously with that ask and circumvent the common tribe record and dash over the dragon wall nice Claret they are talk through but he hitting the shield from Sunday who goes back into the socket the Empower to nice play there are the Camille this matchup really interesting to watch cuz they both have self shielding they both got different amounts of range tools you know if u q auto pack on Hoon you get this filled to the trade some day goes in for the range damage to get to the slowing of the he'll back you can you put on a dog's going can you play run the taunt really like seven different blends to track and play around that matchup definitely very compelling verse which goes through the Sunday but he's now out of Manus was going to see this through for just a second doran's blade and maybe waiting for a potion before I get back in the lane and this is what I'm talking about with Graves having the ability to get down to bottom Lance circumvent those wards looks like we're not going to go to the shop here as well and that's going to be first one in the bottom Lane things are going to lose his wife as well literally everyone in the bottom Lane it's a 5V 3 pipes received ready for that play no hesitation on the double teleport from their solo laners everybody down to the bottom Lane Cody sunset set the bat signal and answer the call you can see how they're playing really really far back very defensively for them so it's been scaring his attempt to your Shout Out by hundred thieves and the trap has already been laid some day gets the key off the wall immediately into the top for my oma just beautiful layering of the crowd control their from The Double Cola laners a project even heading down for the spear to claim the gold for himself and I got to say someday was being toppling instead he'd be recalled to pick II Orange Play he got the refillable and Tapas going into history is a chance that guy was about to hit that button topside and as the gate came in he was always be here and it got them Outlook ambulance shots done so well done of course to The Entity side to put wheels on the bottom side 111 went on to the galio they are the ones with the money he can't push on top fast enough in line bus from Sunday that farm is equal to the two of them everything they would want exactly sells up for Success has a huge bike when you complete runic Echoes that item just gives you so much burst damage and it really puts New Leaf over the edge of the contractors using electrocute so you have this kind of break point where as soon as you can rush to your ruin it echoes completion Italy gets the power to is basically hundred percent to zero somebody if you land the beer with her full combo at once again contract is heading through the bottom side hovering here waiting for the possible since Karen came back in the bottom side yeah that's black Pumas do around as well with guardian and his own shop keeps flashing really needs it contracts right now though going to pull the Drake out of the pit for the floor down cuz Okay you can see me but it doesn't matter has Mike Pence during the same and equal level looks like he is unwilling to try you put last plant over the wall and then yeah like there isn't that much risk on Spencer Drive that said not going to go for the play and it's going to be the Drake picked up he's about a thief so I also would be really scared of that incense Karen Uhl position because they pulled the dragon out
