all right should be a good one golden Guardian coming off their first win of the split and taking down EG yesterday I did like the idea of the historical but I think that could really intelligent not to possess the generals game plan but also has leaked into the donut who wants the group so Hadley and I think that you know that was a really intelligent answer to Camden I was there for me one with you and pick Dan which is really what your goal should be every time right you should try to see what your plan is to try to craft what their game plan is going to be in trying to pick that apart know where the seventies that is going to more effectively work for youwell that's going to work for immortals are going to Hope Has looked pretty good so far as a champion and the LSD at the robot voice really Bush when they lose to go equal amounts kill the champion but that's the way you want to go in late is that have to engage in scrap of them off and Lucy is incredible. They test you for taking more than he does from a silly farming about you brought fighting but we both have used gas and I'm more happy about that than you are right you're going to help scaling still I was like to see something like that from Golden Guardians we saw a lot of actually really good 5-year play monsteryour kind was able to carry Thomas game with that though I think that could be a viable pick I also do you think Ciara and win that lane against that early Lane can be difficult but getting into later stages really hard for a debt due to how easy to stack you parry the hitmaker which is where a lot of the damage is coming from set to reduce the tax rate on the Perry also very valuable and all the HP docking well you have a tremendous amount of Truth in his house before you damage on Fiora that can really cut through that so happy birthday themes in this game earlier so far this split but it's on my seats that so far todayback teeth by Sam heughan press button team Fighters are the BCS and so yeah I really do agree I think that's mostly where that wants to be right now getting some people died in the front line charging up your sugar passive Celiac UW Haymaker out. I think it would be interesting in a long size that anytime you are paired with Millie champion of the past have worked out pretty well but don't think we're going to see it so it will be the syndrome it and we're just waiting for that last big jungle recti popping up to be as a pretty obvious one and that's going to be it for a Smithy people just like this matter in the least in so much and it got to be too comfortable back by player once it has syndromethen they're not a threat of being fully AV though I think pretty nice setup does not pick their top laner before the jugular here they say no set up on the top land is like really know at the cake and otherwise I don't think so actually pretty well in lane and Global healing on global healing FBI my only question is do they have the actual damage output to kill any Frontline Immortals my real concern with its composition iscan you ignore the bed and be successful in that to you by right because with long antennae aren't the highest damage Ambien and it's hard to have a very early in her favour go quite a bit of bushes it's our fault I was at Q they can fit them out for the regen the problem becomes Champion like that very quickly if you take defensive ruins if you take note of regeneration ruins in it was all that you start with a D fields and you have all your passive brezza Lane to 13 Frozen on you because you can't actually sort them off the way you can actually fully push it in what you were looking for Mosey on the rocket is the types of frost a play you have a lot of global help in the form of Dennis Shield fundus Rock ultimate the most effective built Ivan thing and see if you rush into Redemption and that is going to make it very easy to have a super powerful offCynthia feels like golden golden Guardians because no one else besides laying here Soraka in the Middle lake am I like you know it's not the best at the controls at that said I've seen a tennis racket top in prose so you know we'll see what happens if he comes a thought like I'm under play Datsik will teach you to swing by so much it doesn't matter what you do you just walk over everybody so I want to see what's been doing this one going to be exciting game here and our fourth LCS game of the day is on Mortals and golden Guardians 2 battle on summoner's Rift got the visayan free over the third time in a row here on the blue side and a suraka top we're all excited to see for Golden Guardians how many years do you get for Soraka top interactive Kathleen Champion that every top winter hates the play against all right better or worse than spell cease billionprobably about the same really really trying to do much I want to throw back to the worst All Stars event ever wear it was aphromoo vs fragen Autotech only silly monster no Mastery firaga Dragon actually completely outsmarted everyone in that won't be one big ass like he convinced after me to do that and then he convinced take her to do a Nivea won't be one with just birth through have to look at the brand is better bring the hands those hands are good to empowering up empowering up all right but also PTA onset that's a first for me I haven't actually seen that you mostly Jesse conqueror grasp is actually the highest win rate as far as solo queue goes I'm going to have to grab be fairly effective I can not they have everything PTA generally speaking when you are comparing PTA vs. kankuro for stop playing at BJ's is it is very effective as far as Converse in your early game being able to get powerful trade the what I'm looking for is something along the lines of you know hitting you hitting Soraka with the polling or in and then trying to get a really quick trade their to process GTA where you didn't follow up with the handicap trade not too bad I'm not going to be slow and nice to you at all to hear as well yeah pretty close to the pool there as it does have some of that extra range in the exhaust coming out very effective starting absorbing a lot of the damage on both sides is going to work a little bit in Immortals favor as both 80s did use the potion in the Immortals look to try to get a little bit of deep dish near as they do have the bush with the skill order will be for Hunter you know what is going to be humax but there is some differing on how people actually fill this out when they take over 20 W do you actually fully maxed Acuvue Goku and then about 20 feet before you go to w oriole look in the group earlier so that'll kind of tell you how he wants to play the game if he starts back CW early he is looking group if he stays warm purecure he's hoping that he can find me to to be affected in the inside Lane the ones you want to install OS for a while on Castroville when you're alone doesn't do a single thing so going to wait at least two level at all as you mentioned not knock the first no reason to do so yeah yeah it's it's just more do you put more points into you before you go and get that board or not cuz you're always going to go pointing to queue yep that is your way out to your poke it is what is going to keep you healthy throughout these races should I attempt in the bottom side closure is around but they going to cut right back there. We'll go back to his team and just be able to opt out of there so no real issue for him but it doesn't mean that seller is going to go over to admit he is spotted on that you 50 times the camps for a brief but closed going to grab his Grouch without medication if you want to know. Just make sure they passports wrong and the fairly early game in this one it is a very valuable can't take down gold for XP bo4 time I am at Camp Creek pause it was Keith you submitted the command will see what is for a little bit yeah so just a little bit more it is going to be second wind taken by so as though you know that that becomes very very effective against Champions that are so poke Reliant likes rock needs to go down to really threaten any sort of a killer or even laid pressure because you have the door on Shield regen you have second wind region and the passive on that where you're getting additional region every 5% of missing help you have a becomes really a lot for Soraka but so far in the hospital has been controlling that lane fairly well he's been trying to basically hold the wave outside of his turret without letting and crafts which is both a safe spot for him and also you know it dangerous to offer to us not going to be something to watch for certainly as though we wait to hear us out they have not yet heard what the condition is for this one but as we wait to get into the game over August 8th of course very very close gold nickel and a guy still want to redirect to go to glue being a primary can win condition here because you know I'm not expecting this The Rock aside later not switching to the Senate Side Lane and this is the second time is it back to concerts for your game we are golden guys okay we have a very sure we're going to play around one person on the other side in the four of us together and last time around it was it was stingy with the group and all that stuff this is a different one for its gold and it's it's a trend coming through for go to Karns where they're at they're playing very obvious would have one for play Styles actually have LeBlanc game in the first game of the season against these were they had a significant Advantage they felt like they should have been with clothes that came out but they weren't quite able to do it and you know he was performing very well in that but they just couldn't actually close out the game and you know sometimes with LeBlanc you can get the cycling event has what is a very often more about pushing the side lane and then finding a pic you know being able to actually control Vision in and catching people in rotation people going between lanes where you can then pick them off because LeBlanc it's rare that you see the games where the blockages winning through you taking all your towers for a trifle but it's more just about the pressure and then creating vision and no areas where you're going to have a dark spot on the map where he can pair up with closer and try to take people out here as we about three and a half minutes from this point on is what I'm getting for when we're back into the game so not too long ago but he was a good commercial break I understand we'll see you back for the game starts back up but otherwise it's been a closed-top play match up right before and sees over there Midland very very tight there of course as well and on the other side of course we can just line up it's it's been a pretty Center front-to-back stuff as we kind of expected I think the primary engage Duties are going to be mostly Jaco here and work on he is used the most rely cable and gauge we've talked about the fact that set enough to walk at you could walk the front of the art of them but only to get rained it's all pretty short rain is there in and of itself rek'sai flash engages usually not that strong can you be a champion you do Warrior Cleaver and if you're flashing for inform your team you're going on for one that's not ideal either so got to be very watchful of what I can do when he gets out of line for throne season 20 20 or support to spend more than they are opening gold on support items feel like early Bogey's comes through a lot of the time I know I was worth something to do is recalling movies with lock Top Lane and no one ever remembers that supports Monroe yeah I mean I've seen it remember playing a like 5e fight like full pre-made normal game with with Glebe and use total support he's like yeah she told me to buy land on 43 Conestoga Lane top basically it's like pillow the top later I was like one of the few minutes because that you're not feeling good job I worked out we're getting the letter r in chat so ready to go back in this one The Spectator 3 has unpause the game think you could a spectator 3 Let's play League of Legends or waffle play it second one yeah you know you're right let's you just want to get out of here if you up yeah so we will see you know when you when you're comparing gauge options though they were fun as someone who is reserved be very reliable right and you look over on the other side for Golden Guardian they don't really have a super reliable way to engage know you have to rely more on getting a pic with LeBlanc no coming over Crush for some Sofa King flashlight play it with leasing but it's so difficult actually pull off when you are trying to go forward into your posing do you know if you actually just die then you take a cue it can be very Telegraph or on text message prank calls and you starve yourself as you're going forward eventually yeah yeah this is one of the things that we've seen a lot of teams draft me to call me if you like golden Guardian app and they can be successful in the plane for the position of power and the way you essentially for Spicewood TX is 5 going to an objective and forcing her going to come find you in Enfield he feels that they are but yes it gets one of them as they are just for them to get back but it's going to be a pretty hard green or I'll take has TT but I still be damaging the threat can be more time for the counter jungling up on the pasta if he's actually taking the frogs away right now in time to actually stop that way from fully crashing and Smithy is going to be behind author of Silence
