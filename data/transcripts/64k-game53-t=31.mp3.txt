what's the poor Trump with our people they sell them out from that fight they get to kills they just snowballs snow effectively and put a stop to eat at every turn the drafts of also been extremely good from flyquest you know the Swain early we met them multiple times but even the groggett you know as another angle coming in another surprise will be able to take they're not really respected by EG and they get punished for it and move on to Kaiser band now it again is actually a pretty solid picking hecarim overall David you really want to keep playing that one Champion well I'm work as a band does make sense of that what you're seeing Marksman band come through for flight with it again this time they are dropping the Calista off the table as well think so pretty solid from and we get the instant set pick up this time you will still have the project and its chance like what's a whole lot like game 2yeah even those that was nerfed I mean it's been used so well by both solo Ant-Man torrent still pricing that as a takeaway pic but and going right back out to follow their he's had some stuff with it already I know all the early play as I have been dead for successful has kept himself alive the entire series as well as it does for Superstar assist jugular santorin so far 10209 last time can be very very good I think it really does work with a dive composition the question is can fly Quest answer what I'm actually getting to be a dive comp based on these be fixed can they make things happen what's the third pick and Abby are they going to grab an early on stop playing Pixel Force Band away and try to get it so a lot of ityeah cuz they let the both the Gangplank and the rumble so so it's kind of throwing it down here already alright do you really want to pick the game Plank and do I write accident we are going to try and drive you kill you or rejected volibear is such an incredible 2 V 2 no matter what EG try and run on the top side there's the Gangplank pants coming through will they also the rumble up there I feel likedenturist what hecarim break about 6 because the farthest theories and it feels like that's where they were looking right now though support bands are coming through for Evil Geniuses the gragas from last game the 4th is still available I will see that come through some point but part obviously highly prized very very strong was played in game 1 of semen sample of playmaking champion he's been so good for congress all these types of things with the engage so see what they pull out here as your bed away from goldenglue Amigos with the Zoe or something then it's dead I mean if they do have the descendants VK kind of safety bottomland so cold include he's going to have to do a large amount of damage if they want to kind of you don't have those big game device to pull them off5/4 according to the GPS on the backside gear Blacklist I don't have any reason to early pichkari I think they are better boys grabbing their support and waiting but I reckon not a huge shock right here very good engaged tools rakan Renekton and polar bear even ask for the top getting really good in there of course pumpkins to keep people safe pain center can feel sick on her gate apricot also can jump over walls the back but now you really got if you have to focus on those are all right well spindra is left up as the most common orianna counter pick and with Oriental locked in for goldenglue of course it stillgo forward. I find your magic isn't real friends in a row there's on it like based on composition this actually would make sense this is sort of what the cop looks like Santa is great when your teeth and diving in and no I like this is it going to be locked in and goes to nard yeah I really would have liked that too because if you're showing so much utility already sent her a lot of the Laker game is no comeback for healing also she does have a really good rains going Oriana with the extra fuel up in front of you till you can bring with play making with this Champion later would have been cool to see who he has played a lot of Nar throughout his career throughout his ears even at Worlds with SKT and he's going to be doing it once again here in many forms you have to be worried about flashes coming through with a Renekton volibear cuz that could be a really scary combo if they get a flash done on you you are dead other than that though you should be ablekeep your distance hyper digits of buff for a tax speed sonar can utilize it to be really annoying and fried you know keep your range with it the boomerang spam allows you to also play defensively if you aren't we decide you know your junglers already down bottom and you know that there is going to be pressure around so it is a pretty versatile pic but later into the game you also have to play around that rage bar in coordinating with your team shirt know there's a lot more things to think about a lot of things to give up for sure I want to point out that since three games in a row that I believe who he has gotten himself counterpick and this is the first time of those three his Champion is actually favored to win a game of League of Legends against his Lane opponent not saying though the match up in landcape me the case but overall game impact we saw the shed. I've come for example all that stuff can you can make it really really tough right here so now we expect her to do well in protected in line or these pretty decently then also obviously teamfight prowess with the comp around is the first time I feels when he's actually sayto do well so I'm curious to see this is what it takes for you to come around again we expect Cinder to be good at the Oriana but Sandra was heavily nerves and if he's not given First Blood at level one if he's not giving a double kill at level four you might see Golden Honey Bunch better time in this Lane and e g I do think have a draft that we can get behind and be excited for is he they can pull back the series yeah they're going to have to get is flyquest new model of the hashtag go deep but it is eg that have to dig deep right now because they are back's against the walls are going to go down to the lower bracket it's it's looking really scary for them right nowhow to help a TG can play against one win in game 3 music and play a game for otherwise they are down to lower bracket with a date against hundred they'll play that this weekend by the way dignitas first TSM is tomorrow is tomorrow at the same time and place off the fact that yes indeed golden Guardians 3 o t s m and EGR about to face that same fate staring down the barrel of a 300 at the hands of flyquest to the battle title 3-2 are just constantly taking notes how can we get some day to the clap Hootie is heart of solo has been how could we get everything else to go well with Wyoming arrest the crew need to win to keep themselves in the chance of holding I can never buy Cat spot flyquest looking to knock them down here and now immediately started laughing because we talked about a chance like was a those watching that wall light right again as wellis going to be normal start this time around and no possibilities of those level one and a bit more sense Karen and since we're both starting bottom side so if it didn't really want to do you can do blue buff Rob red bumps on volibear you do it really quick cuz it's just a single Target camps with your machetes and you can immediately run up to try and punish Mooney Narcan Bush Renekton early it's super annoying with the range advantage in the boomerangs but I like I was saying if you get up there with a jungler with flash you get up there at level 3 with Red Bluff they can double flash on the on the minion are in even if the other junglers there you win the to be too because the double flash you can layer your CC you could kill a minion are before I can transform uni has worked up his rage bar though and we'll see how well he can keep it lasting and Lane was going to try and stay de autos for thatKahuna Fleet footwork going to be running around trying to type and keep doing the damage 11 out of 12 CS going to be the start good job so low with Dash by the way to get in and out of those fights and gets the F without taking too much damage that match up, it's done right there I think it's working for the hills when needed so nearby they saw it when you walk down to the tribe has really wanted to pull that gank off then he could have run the long route through the river but it made me think that they didn't actually want to go for the yank his whole purpose there was To Kill The Ward they do the word was there he just went to efficiently sweep it and look what it's causing it's causing some extra time since Karen kind of hovers up there waiting for it now possible fight over the bottom crab Midland goldenglue so looks like it should be a dentist scan in the crab fight against the ward knocked out as well so that's going to stay or go to do I get to push So Good by santore get away from this onefour cans of peas benefits can't go to spend that one first and it is in Turin out running the other side of the map to look for walls and second Scott or something it's not going to be it'll be all excited for the guy has been so he's like I can't get the crap either devil crabs. Or empty as being in Basel there a little bushline up pretty easy to take it for themselves as well I always goes nice to get the the Devil's Double strap with the extra safety and leave santorin with a lot fewer options cuz he did kind of reverse clear back down here no more cancer from the take only his present or up so you just going to sit there with no extra cancer taken these kind of forcing of the possible think they're on to Oriana think better of it and just has to return to the crop I really like this Landing by Bangin basil is hard to do if you don't get really really good farm at Bank of a recall off of five waves right wave number 8 3 6 9 12 oz can of waves going to recall in theBeast of a can of refried beans going to recall on 5 or the 5th Wave write any medicine recall on the 5th Wave with enough money for a pickaxe you did not get that without very good CS 32 CS gets really really good Mark by Ben well done to him if you don't have Mechanics Bank you're not going to get that kind of Rico and so he's able to get in line at a certain time he lost 3 melee minions and how we going to have to have a recall this boat in sight for a while and he's going to get a lot of Lane pressure I think we should expect an early break out of Spencer enough pressure that she look really good easy side bun I slept right here from hunie twiddling solo down probably going to force a Teleport Rico husband he's doing good job keeping up that pressure and looking good right now for so long already down that potion to heal back up to 1/2 HP svenskeren does have a reason to be topside get a gun as he's burned through stop jungle once again without any word coverage theoretically write a 1/2 health fieldAmazon flash available dogs away the boomerang he's okay but did you really see who he is putting her down right there and so was trying his best to pick up the scraps and to be fair and equal and see us so not too bad. Just yet because it's been one charge of his race by so close to turning into Mega that it's not as scary as we're talking about before where the flash would mean instant death on 608 from Megan or you are just you could know about and Well Done Right There the XP could have been truck but it could play fight who would he gets to spend the wall Goodfellow I spent staring The First Time all series EG gets first Blood between mini and that's why he wasn't scared they even had things down on the river looking for it who did you just turn to the juicy jungle are coming up you hit Level 6 off of this minion he's able to get that last melee kill immediately turns for the chill out of the level 4 jungle are so so nice to hear for EEG cuz they had really been getting destroyed in the series now they've got a nice early game to work off of my right is a fence Care on Garfield it more comfortable at the fact that he's got the same boots that his opposing Champion has been touring but you better recall it was more gold in the pockets right now who's going to pick 3 call hilai Portable Buildings and their Rico 6:40 into the game. Late other threats Eternal thankfully for himself has teleport to get back to recall he's going to try to recall the wave is in front of his door and it doesn't get better break their winning in Top Lane that they are winning in bottom line is looking really good right now and I do like that Golden Globes going with the more scaling Oriana option where you start a few early heading towards the seraphs it's it it does have a little bit weaker than your other man options but I just love Sarah so much with the transform especially with with Oriana added the extra shield for yourself later let you use your your ball in your positioning so much more offensively yeah but you can stay alive and get those Shields everything else going to feel comfortable there power people just be one until we get the better of it the 210 CS at under eight minutes for three calls come through Forty Thieves come through as still look at ninja tabi and double longsword so it would stand a lot more the damage and he's like well I'm a recall any way it was before the big year old who cares knock it out to Binion's I'm going to come back and get my items to yeah she answered pretty quickly to with a cell phone so I was pushing fast pushing in on that wave to try and force it did you see if that was a no way yeah so there's going to be a small distinct beer for flyquest in their favor for solo but not going to be a very big deal and 1/2 minutes in a bit normal for Rift Herald spawn as
