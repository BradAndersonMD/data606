this sort of crazy style Cody son is a very different style play raise a standard Marksman player so clutch have to really decide what kind of style you're going to play in and start to work with that quickly mail right off the bat Clutch Gaming have their ideas on some Jungle Band Zoloft first band is usually a little surprising for me we'll see what they can give it to you later on as they are still going to drop off that support pick and it is I'm sure there was a reason why I and end its could be proved out through doing lots of drafts but I think he is almost always lose Side Band there have to be some reasons unknown prefix before you don't respect that you're also your support as attractive as a very high skill cap as far as I know Des Moines he still shots and being able to jump in and out on Tuesdays popping off auto tax in all in all these sorts of things thoughI also could be simply a situation where you are not willing to bet you Obama I mean wild violets again first pickable here to get there if you want so I reckon and the Beast Engel Jungle Band of Olaf dropping that's a lot of answers available here a lot of them are still actively up yet because got nerfed that is still there call he is still there if they want to go that route Nico going to be locked in very close as well as can be both made our top but we generally do see Nico top yes it was also very rarely played in Flames it was my fault line but certainly expecting to be going up to author Silas could be going tothey are certainly a team that can Flex by a bit well right off the bat we going to see jovon answering pretty quickly in and you're going to pick bought one of the very end unless they kind of crazy Shenanigans and they're ready to go last week it was in a lot of their O2 but it have a fairly good performance you know what was the situation so where it felt like oftentimes he was reaching in trying to be almost as you're looking for these long-range Wiser's instead of combining it with the rest of the team I am happy to see if this time around because I do think the cataclysm set up for some very powerful if you can block multiple Weiser it's an enormous amount of damage and already feeling like clutch fuse again looking for team play a very good to see what they can round out this draft with you to Golden Gardens dropping to the big as of river marksmen off thewho I was David Italian singer probably are the top two overall bot laners League of Legends as far as Marksman are concerned also worth noting that the golden Guardians bottomley this place before it's as real Tom cash so are they actually going to be in a way, cancel or not yes it has been kind of Nerf as far as I know the rank one open it for now that's something out to be grab them course again no stylist in trouble or is only matchup so right off the bat for frog in and now it is read yet ruled as it gets here and go late great do that with Jinx do in pieces going to have to be a guardian have a very magic damage heavy composition when you're looking especially at a half side of the math aliera Miss certainly can be looking at things like in early cow or lemur tread best type of deal can be very very effective and that is always a concern I have when I'm looking at the three AP top side that being said I could go on it to offset some of that they're looking for it feels like the last are switched around as well. engage Gulbis Garvin and not really good team by back up with Rumble and drinks and Silas good all-around can easily handle the side lane himself so you like the Click Five On Five to go to the guardian more required distance in setting it up you got it didn't work still shot Reliant for example I either way I think still good chance it will be very interesting I always liked looking at Silas and in what time opens there are two steel and wild Corky's ultimate is not the most compelling Azrael thrash stage 1-e and Nico all are very powerful the certainly have to be really worried about what if you file it looks like when you can steal an ego ultimate to have so much guaranteed set up for it with the Darvin and the Nautilus we're getting ready to go on to watch turn their face around golden Guardians star in the summer split they are expecting and it is pricey tecnico so maybe this one here yeah so it is on hit don't think you would be going for that ruin if you want Go Ahead Tours blade and that being said you know yes they already have double Martin but I do think it is one of those situations that the kind of distracted themselves into where you have to be really cognizant of the fact that if you're if you're allowing your phone Cisco so easily into magic cyst on the top side in and make it come here early AP that can be dangerous but I'm getting wrapped around on here wow that is that hit if that was a detective left that would have been a slow into I think it would be knowing that it would have landed cuz, I would have fired and they would have gone right over the wall on to that one answer that was not frog in right that was a fake frog in so he doesn't have Valkyrie there's no way to get over the wall and it would've been maybe a flash down by the fact that concert. he backed off at just the right time of the tribe rush they didn't have any information that it was coming over and do the contract is going to be starting with that sweeper will be able to figure out that Ward and applied where he goes to a program to get level 2 off the first wave so if he's at equilibrium at all against money he's going to get to First have the route available to have a good chance that I keep battling with Rumble off the rest of the wave and I could be pretty meaningful as time moves on and on song that goes back up to the top side here and now we look at both these guns with safety driving the red Boston do you do a Lincoln Avenue in Bala have you really exactly where hanser does go you know how I would love to see something along the lines of a width and I think that can be very effective early on it if either of the people that would mean in The Rumble in Tempe right was there but that being said you do still have to be worried about Jarvan and the potential for early Gangsta with that sort of a bill because you're not building any sort of defensive stats against physical damage from looking for acculevel to now is Lyra always not going to spot the ward is it comes around so he doesn't know he was seen it might not matter there might be no chance to stop him off his blue buff but yeah they turn over without a Golden Gardens Hilo sweeper misses you will still get this blue buff steelies doesn't have to that's coming through to him vertical jump length but I think they actually didn't notice I'm not sure maybe go into vertical jungling from that position because almost always you will see the jungles make that decision when they see near Jay for coming in and being there just goes and takes the blue you can see who even expecting this going to check that blue but it is just going to be a three month year for Lira he's going to be able to get the additional camp all right forget I'm done going through the fog of War right now and actually yeah I mean that was like I'm just like watching it back and forth over and over again in like Jarvis like walks by the floor they saw him and just no one noticed so that's pretty sloppy honestly from Golden Guardians to not have spotted that out unless they spotted him know one thing and still decided to just go and give up with rebuffed but that seems pretty strange but it is it is possible given that are there was a pushing toppling from uni maybe didn't feel that you can make that in Vape not really sure either way will be the free bus start for each and every feeling good about that opens tell if you can have a pretty decent I actually admire camp Lee just Inn in current kills for contracts and are you going to have slight Farm leaves in top and mid right now is contracted looks around pretty nails to do and now honey bunny a really good play Anna Hans are good damage there I'll send it back but certainly by the rumble you at the way of pushing and you're able to shove him out you're going to get to see if he almost guarantees you're out of Haunter and who needs to have the luxury of just pushing this in and walking back to Lane so they don't have to look for any sort of curly Dragon play if they want to look for any sort of early bot Lane plays as well and I will see if he can get it pushed in and try to get that sort of an advantageous reset sound goes me but yet again we'll see how long a who he's able to greet on to this one it's always nice to go to stay a bit longer and get a bigger recall off but simply to doran's Blade plus the refillable potion would have to come back with a thousand gold and now we have fallen under pressure is Leah comes around the first plate goes down and Golden Garden Place so far back in his Duo would be a very second plate right now lyrics to wait in the wings there's something in this could be some damage going across and that the flight was pretty sun sun damage come around there saying hey I'm here be smart and now Hootie coming down as well as they shut up the waif how well will this dive go through at the Swap Shop take out here for the Fitbit always still alone and I'm going to drop him that one is to kill a whole lot of seven deadly TV back in his own lane yeah really aggressive play here from clutch and I love it they got to be events on the top side now getting that Jinx the head there are already winning the to be to straight up and Christian invoking doing great work in this matchup that we will be able to see if you back and no recoup some of this Pharmacy vintage but still they even got frog and CPS Authority down for the bottom Lane end to kill gears look like this one more time II play was already down it was good Pokemon the volume which didn't help to dissuade earlier you can see the father on the hook too kind of counteract with Russia trying to do there and you know they were hard committing to this because he had committed to CP they pull aggro here in just books on house Jager around pretty damn well bending of the reset it rabid up your from Lear who is voice being commit that so I can kill 220 music thousand gold lead now for clutch but not supposed to guard his testings around early stages life from last time he had no coffee or Demonte is up to that top Sides Now Judy answering in the Middle Lane so not sure if this was just because they want a cat make up there faster because I believe he did have a seat be available but I do like the moving you having Demonte now has that pawpaws weekends deal from Haunted right now so let's wait and watch what the next play is going to be so you got still at 1,000 gold lead clutch burning after that bottom jungle yet again this time now they know it's no 7 is down there they just saw Olay flash Cody sun has often spoken not that far away from 6mm self but another frog heading back towards the midline Now look for what could be done to this poor Corky is looking this coming through fog of war that trinket without spot for the rotations that contract might do it tomorrow not seeing him but there's always a possibility would these tickets are going to bottom and well they know exactly where he is and now the number for us to actually try to fight here around this blue book case is a little bit late to the Play-Doh on a good smile and give him a right back out of that one's that's between basically nothing against that she told us it is the Gardasil to stay safe right here sitting there with their boss and their own hand not the champion they wanted to have it but at least it's under their control is a good attempt it doesn't get much of anything but it doesnae that leave from frog and as you pointed out so I can wear these little piece of pressure but Oleg contractor able to handle that one pretty well we'll be but you're making the move for the dragon is very powerful level 16 Seer and when you do have a little thick by Jarvan as well as a stylist who has pop up and failed to engage into and when I was at 6 as well you're going to have that guaranteed engage and Kylie impactful pop Blossom wave please the midline. They had a timing out there is no more to be had is that Drake was already gone and now what's that going to come back up if he can take himself 7 rockets and went through with that to you on this package is just going to get out of the map I'm not likely to be able to really get any sort of Romans done with it just using a
