when when we hear that money get sight seeing people sitting so when it's atticus of bowing out in advance of a lot of around one who was not really stepped up those martin hill c. has now back to the track points easy it's easy to specifically that all their losses that in these klinger games and then the kasten versus cloud nine the whole we've got to get on the supportive of the comet that's not the work that all was recently that caught my game which cannot go split was free bo mobility champion the people are starting to really come straight their view on since you gave him when he can do is of lawyer in with the overall team issue then to as far as their game plan coming in to check in selecting having step was shocked yeah the nearer they are putting people in the second and third best team of those prints blood and all that was on tobacco them bigger explosives either very aggressive even that would give it seemed like they was there to be cleaned up the sniffer dogs leads all the teapot exceptionally well that was aggression on us and stare and you didn't do want to stop and that is what they're much less aggressive see him dear frontline ever looks as you mentioned the blood that has the right where we'll have pressure on that one out either for the first vote but again and the flavor carver game we're okay yes yes was pressure but he get the explosive as of now because of a composition thought bought clothes olympic athlete we're not even reverse merely been your weight is deals with goldman and though they're throwing those styles and a big burly in summer is the time before those files level with its seventeen trying to branch out because the topic to make why not study for the couple with tissue with yes that doesn't work that but we lost because of those trials in so whether go back to old standards of all they pulled maybe it might well they walk in a little piece of old faithful with is a very good stealing from wiberg it's going back to an eclectic rebellious and all of a first round on the right side here we see so many teams do it over summer's flood water most alert gat little bit more play making i like always trying to go this route into nfl yost final opening round needed you be saying that it enables least in her enables its maybe to buy your goat frankly a lot of those pigs earlier in the game and basically your goals were you saying i'm gonna try to play get a kill then i take the object of trouble is the one who writes about plays out of the o. winning winner something and focuses on the u. p. the oh little bit more by leasing and work on double walking is so much more we need a finer pygmy viewfinder kill first then we'll go to the detective afterwards and the priority and getting it to go on the wall there's the most awful no but yet it is the announcement of a troubled when i'm older but outside we're ready to go with what delight is not sit here and the warmth of the very keen with a man was giving power back on the moral side he's like the gas the law by t. this man is to be on dates and that's okay that's all i did okay with it again i'm salsa music to both of you be very afraid the cavity more about that because then a couple bags away and what the problem but our right to be focused on support than supper con always worried about figure the gate supports the amount of stress also to me is what they're really good ones i i always thought about it but seems like people then we'll an anomalous more often now but i'm always happy to play pressing to wait not take this film accept i love when you see that dress player into rubber conflict of ways and then he'll hit him with dad's death sentence father trying to jump back to their carries a straight line and so and i would those days although for that little bit more skill intensive around but i know so many people just love gone with the not 'cause it's an easier point and click and our bodies t. v. set the auto stocks it pure course didn't respond in yeah i i get one of the bowels of the was going over all the bands are finished going to use that as the enemy and the band was there so the driving through the lore of alf white so are available they think the oregon colombo the world water problems of our although or a bill that would not yet they'll both number of us wanted our studios robocop or on their immoral very deeply that one of the motor organized opposition so we'll push infinity down on his is only is still all lies locked into that graham of florida one a one last thought you had at last the middle of foul play and i and i didn't know what our agro borne out by four larvae that there why is that a lot of those games thus far better god is another red tape is that he's super are well known for now i have this time being academy i do like it to the top side the more i think he ought to scatter grind you down her guide is gonna bust a couple of faxes ago now i'm pretty far in the past but no one else really picked up the sea sometimes like some stockings from whitlow or something they need to know it's the other other players it really not like the champion and enjoy the yeltsin might take the news of it but running out with instead he's as the year like you said i have really liked his quarry on a witness mark for now get out already he he poured super well onstage and ours guys and signed by you were the most iconic terry chance the league of legends that is in the bomb what i like the goddess of the boats like they're evil geniuses or going again hurry fairly standard screenplay based opposition now i will say to date is good on they've noticed in bonuses court the game right now with the rebirth for the gay with clipper them right when a dismantled field you very very hard on their first game's we can play the background is really well i'd like the budget in with the agency in the or not can be a big way maker to go for flat shock waves of whatnot as they did so i think this became very very well i still think any edi got that backed up with solid team fighting beggars on the belly of speed all the sea got a solid front line here with it with trouble with the ball up there with the nautilus end of the corky thus far the well put out you got to bull rider still good for what the good will do all blocked and waving the gun up with something more standards that would be solid i'd like to board a flight i'd think they have looked pretty good on this one up they played some top he was very very close and onset of iraq about yes i mean ever since they gave they put the arctic smith the roster back in a deal with apollo woodcock awoke and then the the rookie so lame duck of flavor it states that a bit of a revival for for the team and for the branded anti apartheid cheering for them again as underdogs the deadly still a big dogs going to get he'd see here as they see the draft of we've talked about having kind of a checklist of approved do seagate that champions that is that way does the step that box as though they are aware there are within the bounds and as setting themselves up for a success he adds up to that the the funding of course we know now that the place we've got to squad that they're tied it fits into each he cannot reach that market began the first round robin they will opposite around for birth so you know they went out about it until they get the reignited the double teamed up with them i had a lot about is that it's purity needs of the desert agreed and easier still exceptionally strong team got bigger still will be reasonable to you very well may be good world things like that we get the comp the bottom three hero's welcome an iq hold out hope for mortals we had the interview for you know where any thought about wildly improbable else thought they do it but i think the morals or are they really wanted up is it please the voting booth is about where i'm at this thing so far you cannot throw out the first four games look at the one who played so far and eddie's the book with all those team looks looks pretty solid yes i think it was the one with a king day here we are not been stealing some competitive integrity right now suited for other dive into the champion so like while we have some time bomb again i talked about as good as they were tapes but i love this this type of jungle match up where you stand expect the white here he is the detective hearing here's the ball take this ball in the early game with c. with hannah plays you can create baum and him in a taco bell that you have one of the above average support in jungle that time spent together howard hughes medical support proximity sacks and i ended this is a match made in heaven cuisinart onto the most mo bout sits in the game boys love to see it when they can make those jobs and play off of each other to catch someone outside opposition and so you look for these important time in windows when the bottom get their first recall for the support on the thought that bill head straight at the plane so they have options of pointing this at the map on before working to to place their words with their jungle or sometimes again you know go ostensibly trying to go when an a undergoing is one of those so those types of diamonds were you looking at the police backs are working for eyes on yeah and and real sick leave these lines to look gay couples well aside from both the goal very good old the waco little bit the immortals jumble support our july think a lot of very good targets at the skills that the league of russo i'm theory cures see how that one can play out on coming into the week hot go okay and stated he led the entire weekend killed as a patient overall the b. word by the best the roll their best to be entirely goes to how don so what the heavy lifting your firm or the gear to we're very very best players and and a bigger look really solid metal we did have to rig the game is that the i'd leave brought heel of the game which means we have to rebuild the way bob dole for all that stuff we're going to go to waste for commercial break we come back about me it's your vote he thank thank that could had a fifth up for of theft didn't have and fifth for food food food food food food food food food food food food food coughed up why a room and to put this out the hope and a have a thought cold and half the hull of all go back to sell we're getting into the importance of white got our faces and routes in and head of rebel a place that is that your head indians and summer icons and boll boll could do good old austin
