spell league as if it's a game of unforced Errors right it's a game of capitalizing on the other teams are in trying to make his few unforced errors as possible yet at a certain point was not making any more ways to initiate and drive Templeton that's where you need to like to see CLG go to a range hood for play for bottom Lane dominance look to really push the tempo there if I'm I want to play risk aversion play Eddsworld sit back in the bottom line graph something that can be taking their turn that can be really punishing them and drawing pressure they're away from those solo Lane build at your sole interest can be more comfortable in and not necessarily under constant pressureno one comes through here at Forest a lot of times teams have several looks at they are kind of ready for Seattle dress the affront it okay rent to play a certain style here in two different here and there was a lot of Destruction around so I would imagine the last conversation was about or would you still lose I think it's the right choice Advantage here because of the Jungle pressures it's been known for bringing its what pizza last game I think by and large dose Marfan makes a lot of sense because they're in and then pick away that akali still you know kind of accomplishing a similar thing in this picwork to dominate the skills you bought length we saw in the regular-season steals be also using Caitlin very very well and they use Caitlin Lux that can take down liquid for example and a strong leader here for six a those this good luck to be trying to fight this match I've had on the karma is still up right now you stop talking fight scene I didn't go for it there but the major Lane. Support left up on the table right now with the uni band away and locks not really in a great state for pro play in the current patch 9:15 one. Do seals you really go hard for a person following to try to answer back to Caitlin Firepower I mean we have seen this is our last week we don't know, last week that there are options but I don't think these are the kind of blind pick 4th you would go for G4 makes a lot of sense here this is more play making I think it's listening for the side of cod2 they have an additional way to kind of pull the trigger and start fight so I do think that is going to help quite a bit like to see how proactiveexpensive is very exciting cuz I was called back to the tiebreaker game against Ira cotton Cloud 9 will we see Cloud 9 band Camille with their final band game and walking in a prox because they'll still have a lot of flexibility and you'll still have what looks to be very strong Lanes locked in and I are getting banned out I wouldn't mind a Morgana van here either we got more going to last week and I actually think work on his is one of the better matchups into fresh the black field interaction with book is very very effective this is certainly something that well now they don't actually need to bend a meal because they dropped this bandFox reports Tod Healthy Choice Sports the latest date we're not playing that game at all because it's still a great pics are you can you can block the hooks with bruise so now they are not a lot of the intelligent picks year for field we have to be okay by Frost what else do you have for it are you willing to go for something like perhaps you know the car you can use that fairly rapidly are you going to play the part that we seen a few people bring out in recent passes and they sort of a higher risk and you know you can still run a lane with those texts but you don't have the innate defense against the force that Sarah does with the plants walking them or condos with the black feel so it's basically LaSalle's play one of those spot where I guess is going to be taken into the jungle Hunter lateryeah Discraft because teams are adapting to gain 1 and 2 3 games they played in the regular season actually quite unique even the first akali which is a drop that is already further than not very popular kick the first time she has played a call this split so a lot of proving to be done this is the fourth time they've actually play Tom can chickens Cloud 9 so they're really needing to get that Tom kench off to make an impact on the side lane which it did not in the last matchup this would be really interesting this would be a very heavy focus on those islands there if we do get this Alia intro to be going to that event before it answers with rash well but it means that they are not going to be pulling this land are not going to be having a lot of pressure very likely down there and carbine will have counterpick here in the middle and I decided this what does he will bring out for us and it may have to be silent yeah with an ultra flexible first pic like Silas you're able to do stuff like this towards the end of the draft but that is still an advantage to match up first injury and if we look at the way game one played out where c o g was trying to withstand pressure in the mid lane and make it work bottling they lost that game pretty horrible so this feels like a pit from c o g with Sandra and a jar been looking to actually play around p o e in the mid lane and not let snowball and put that pressure off work and definitely a new look for CLG trying a lot of things here in game 2 Cavs game 1 wasn't so hot for them. I got to see what field you can put together to your neck and neck throughout the entirety of the summer split a tiebreaker game shows wisdom has a higher season the same vein coaches shake hands off they go and we'll see you still didn't answer back for game to buy always liked looking at anytime Silas is there what are the key ultimate you can take a nice man is going to be very big just filled that ultimate in this game because Sandra and Varys don't have good ways to actually escaped from that cataclysm you're extremely dependent upon your block those numbers down Garvin are we as well hear from the Gangplank and some really powerful and I think he is just no consideration as we get into this game 2 for 69 is how well there was one tree one matchups go play out later in the game so not only is Jarvan a good alternative steel Force Alice in the mid game feeling ultimate is amazing if you get ahead to see if your collie vs eyeless backed up so many times during the year and really Whoever has more gold this win because of how much Mobility both of those characters have and chase you down ocsc 920 start or cattle at the gaming answering back in style you have to help line of scrimmage across the river for both the sides right now and do look on the light upstair on both sides. And I'm playing much more about their boettler the keep fresh line up the very strong to on to ruin their with the akali going to be exciting to watch he's been one of the big stand for CLG that split and he's got a great Champion to make his mark on the game but he is such a player I believe it was 11:00 unique champions in the regular-season know the first game of the season he had not had a double for any of his Champion pics so it's been so exciting to see if the new life has brought to CLG now he's got a handle on The Kilted coaches take away they got him and I am doing by Weldon and Irene well didn't you kind of told the players before Embrace that pressure that comes into this game so how do you reset mentality coming in a game to I don't think they're needed to be much reset on the Fireside they're really focused and and they know where they miss play it and they're confident and Irene a little bit of insight into what kind of may have been some problem from game one so I think we have another strength against the do, we are not going to make it into that plan so that's our main problem all right thank you very much for the game we'll see what that has for us they said she's so interesting to see how she is actually initiated Lance pop it's actually power of evil give me going pop against the GP so laying against that TP and they will be bringing ruin to the mid length and it's a level 2 coming up a weekly but I mean syndra Kathleen is kind of the definition of a low Mobility top laners how is highly vulnerable to gain but it does really changed the complexion of the game because she 9 how to watch to do the mid lane to be too but since Karen is just kind of being told you should go talk to her that since she spent so much time it is early game this is a threat to talk so it is jungle path was actually read it all the way up to Top Lane then from toppling he goes over Tuesday the Red Bluff do you call this just nothing there so we still have one Camp killed unfortunate for him and he is going to be set for got there and has now the ability to look at pressure top plate that was an early game cam but it definitely didn't work out and now look at this quickly actually cutting chase down till you can actually fight that guy gets whatsoever so now he's going to have to go back to work as well as a potentially the bottom side Scuttle it's early level to play Go Round and Round Top Lane and a great war from licorice really bored at all of it will end of the day by 20 minutes to get his to Camp so Spencer went to invade and saw Wiggly kill his own blue and wolves and other days they both kind of a popsicle to go to spend that's of course good Fantasy 9 slide that Vision very useful for her. We match up is but yeah we're passing only got to work till also a camp and Facebook app and a half ahead Horseman scared because you're not the first girl dress the game but we definitely not completely out of it because he was able to recover his action doing and if they just don't know in defense Karen spend extra time on the Scuttle crab still those early game level to get price can be recovered from a smart or they can go to that Swiffer licorice trial by fire the fern from GP condom at the end of solo Kill from the GPS disaster in this Rangers is really lame sometimes the game is all about where you create pressure and then where you spend the pressure other time it's just about killing someone especially when they try off and throw a huge curveball licorice he's not going to know how to lean against us but looked just takes a little bit too much grass poke and that was lingering the lane surprises. The second one comes down Liquors knows exactly how to convert not familiar laying against the Gateway. And it cost I'm somebody's going to feel safe and have come to the bottom Lane, just like they're either but he knows you cannot buy a break now yeah yeah I always have a question do you have in that table top link is quite different compared to mid-length without especially your supposed to ovulate the mini waves get advantages and when you can push when you actually fold know it's a lot easier kind of play more safely and how are you so good at doing that in the second least as I do believe but it'll getting killed in game 1 and number five. Going solo kills here early on Indian first time she has done that there was another game in the living room. Hotel 1 B-1 solo kills for both of them and that skill matchup midlane boat ruin and misky Bernie basically everything but this device just enough time it look like the turd shot was the difference in that fight and I think ruins are to their came up just short it actually looks like you did not connect with the second half of the r on Tedeschi and we'll have to see that one more time but the confidence to Fashion it what came down to the final Auto same as we can go for that one but weekly ultimate do is licorice year at make you safe in Wichita disinfect over the walls and then it coming by as well no kill Sierra but the game state is 600 gold in the lead for C9 the Venice of the kills were three in a gold peso Misty is 6 first but ruined looks like he gets level six in the crowd pops out like trying crack that are 2 Aftershock right at the end there to give them the extra bonus resistance and then steals the ultimate to get that final execution also almost all the time
