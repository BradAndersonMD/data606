carb lunch right now to change whatever the hell you want to make things better be there over in the New Wealth as a team setting to Champions like that's my cue to had it back over to our Brilliance pastors gentleman for horses not quite that record but so far I go wind in four sticks a sure I can accept that logic but look at the Academy games when does play take over there his stats are fun6 days there is no thing that I can look at it healthy wind is a better player than six I eat around 3713 instrument a meeting point better there there are other behind-the-scenes and maybe the ability to really step up and become a great player for this organization if we give him space time and we allow me to Bellefonte sell BLTs Squad then maybe that makes sense because they're not going to be credibly unlikely for them to be able to do that very well could be Wonder earlier today Top Lane Champs definitely stop playingspell thieves as you going to heal the crap out of receipt yeah it's actually in a free spells that are on the live now this was the highest win rate oplinger in and buy a lot early overpower her way without actually going into the penalties for selfies you pick up a couple of minutes for weight gain range for experienced you harass and Brock selfies on cool down and then you just become a ton of goals and Hannah levels and can really support your team come t five time when you're playing at the big like a norn or I can't just win the game through cycling is Jana you know so with that walked in I do think it makes sense as a pic and I am assuming it's going to be tough for secluded who played standard in support role but it's one of those things we're generally I think the best strategy against detective off rerun the support officewhat is a slow cooker and give him back some type of Flip or Champion which they probably won't play making as well so for sure top yeah and it's looking pretty hyped by I do think that this fun I'm I am always happy to see teams grow out stuff and try it out when we had if you watch this morning or evening if you're over in Europe or any other for the times I need two of us but what are there x o x i c the champagne was absurdly Opie and so love you in as like well I should just try even though it's going to get there pretty soon this was a good pick for it so I went with it and it's not going to work next week I will try this out I will innovate I will play the new thing I respected of a player I'm happyyou will make even more sense if you're as guilty situation in your 2 and 10 right swing for the fences a bit here you are not expected to be TLC love 1/4 of their last five although they are 6 and 6 and there aren't of a High Street they dominated last weekend only had one death between two games of them is. Like that so I respect taking a swing here and saying hey maybe this is not so we're going to do every week but this could get us a win over Seattle and nose keep us in the running rocks and keep you under 3 days ago and you give him the past three wins fight for them as you mentioned for the last five it has been looking better and mid laner gets picked they are interesting but they will make sure they give me the confidence before they lock him and that always tells me you have a I have something that I thinkgood if their composition allowed for it do you want to be able to see what your plans are going to run and intake based on that I do think when you're running a high damage so it could be something along the lines of are you considering you know Olaf reconsidering maybe mckendra drag race or something like that I can scale well and be another kind of for sporty but I will say it's pretty damn low on a beach right now yes there is some ability to pay post a private some old are the threshold or detector thing it does not eat Street the back line carries the Victor in the MF right when you come to teamfight I'm at 49 brommer sending ahead you can't do this does improve your ability to actually land books as well Scout of the week with consistency you throw down the pillar the a we slowed their place with a pop-up gives you a chance to follow up on that also help them to shredBrew at the front line is not traditionally built as kind of a damaged carry easy LPS yes it is effectively no giving you the same sort of idea right it's making the tank squishier and turn off the feeling that same role gigantic damage am through your entire maybe you knocked on the orne fast enough the Bramble kind of may have stolen plate for the majority of the game does look pretty good for is vog hear the facts I should be safe there. You could carry I'm also really interested in the bottom line here because I do think we did have a competition we have to have a good game if you get slammed in laying you don't have a vagina is there could take that strong. Make them even stronger last time they thought it was 6 a.m. doublelift in the bottom line so completely different what TL absolutely slammed CLT doublelift and chords JJ got they were dominant and feels she is going to have a strong lady performance gearand smoothie if they want this company for workout Envy and we're going to see how much work can be done are in playoff position we note Op 2 is what you are fighting for and flyquest and DSM are in Striking Distance for the TLC Squad counter logic gaming not out but certainly move their way back up I can make it pop sticks they are Four Winds behind fix place right now with only a few games to play 6 to go a real quick chat back and forth about dodo things guys do do EC tactical oh my goodness oh and he's out there we go okay well there was a man of the hour right there taxi k'lon survived me invade but just asking decision-making for continuing to keep him in this week despite devilish for covering up so we used Costco last week and we're pretty great week and the team in general played really well around by the doors are the things that I was bringing to the team competitive voice so we don't wanted to see more of him with a team and you know we wanted to make sure we can have a better decision is going into the rest of the split with the strongest roster I'm sure he's excited to prove himself in the fans are excited to see him play DotA thank you and back to you guys give me the Depo owner of Li Shang his team award and becoming a list of the first four minutes of game I almost I cursed him out of his death list that it's always fun to do it looks like a spotted on the Redbox today start Wiggly going to leashless hear the most part I believe maybe ruin a little bit against the donut she really intelligent you put Warren did where you can just brush a Bissell and actually be going to completely fine against in dress so that's no longer dangerous match up there you put Victor top where does a Range vs Reigns match app that can actually win out against this Jonathan Warren is not going to have the ability to take down the John it gives you a free Lane to actually proc spell thieves constantly any time you were going to practice golf tees in a Range match up as as Jonah when your gas detector you were going to be getting traded back on so it's actually a lot harder to keep up with gold efficiency of that I didn't have it on cool down the whole time you can just get bullied out in straight up a lose this one do you want one for the back the sun comes down to one for one of them mentioned first logo dirty liquid-filled does get first what I like to play from tlg very aggressive they had level one still on both those TL bot laners able to do a very well-timed I fear this was just a red to blue straight to bought Rome down here from pobelter and they go for it for tax analyst position pretty well they get the Braum's done over on to win he did get Auto buy for JJ and pack those able to brought that allowing them to take him down and get first Blood before he does ball should have just waited for me to call Akron the first place that does not have teleport get the taste of blood damage but getting back to Wednesday heart exactly so this is why you're not playing no see if that happens but every dank like this where you even just gets jumped out but you survived is way more punishment because you don't have control over what is right and know this match-up is going to become much more difficult for ruin anytime he's getting jumped out he's going to lose control do Jensen right now is trying to deny a lot of these minions and not even going back to work around and put Kelly's tp2 top of a now fighting the bottom size 3 B2 down here some of the most we got going to find that stone on a threat about us going to keep sending me forward it smoothie finds the killing and they have to have the Catskills kt82 deaths in the first couple minutes after having a deathless weekend Joshua Smith so there she just going to try two lanes blocked ear off and then he could even a match that lane swapping just going to continue to do this because so far ruin has been having a lot of trouble in that matchup against with Victor and I see no reason that they shouldn't just going to try to maintain those Lands End swap around know how have Jensen bass have in fact try to push this out but growth is one more time weekly waiting out of range that wart is bought and now movie do lashes in 5 when's the hook they're onto tactical who did not have his flash I do think maybe before they could have just make that book and allows axle kind of just get out of there he left his life instead but it is hard to say. Equations where maybe for two days that he paid well I can dodge it if you can judge it to then neither of us have to use Summoner and we get out for free but either way it does mean tactical Dale's down one more time and he's very far down in farm lucky he got that first Blood because otherwise it would have been pretty bad and cl does just linked to operate back and now it's going to be really coming here because room wants to get out he's just going to try to link up again is going to become the shuffle back and forth that is why you're calling your jungle gear not to try to gag when to say help me pushing this way so I can leave I don't want to lean against the Victor got an Isis you know if you're going to hit the nocs penalties did she goes to hard boil so so yeah you know hey congratulations also means they shut down the gaming leopard I've being baby questionable because conjugating face be tied and gold upset Drake and they'll see when you're looking at these to be gentle with your gold is caused by the fact that it's 48 219a when you're comparing the picture to him down like three hundred gold important that you get the experience and that's where I'm a little bit more concerned because we're just hit Level 5 has been sick for a bit so he is holding pretty far behind is the cost of trying to lanes while back and forth constantly and trying to dodge this lame is that if reported has link control when you do that you are missing minions in your missing experience and Route again is just running away from Victor then through this whole game so he is falling down in the experience do y'all have very well scaling So lyrics not as though there for depend upon that really getting thicker and order free Lane that has a cost to rent a Bentley play together by the way it's are you appointment in the game so if he has a 1/3 of his golden camera from Minions I supposed to go camping he will take - 10 code for Minion are you so so that's fine so far but keep potentially dive Jensen to withdraw secure both of us it could be risky I wouldn't mind Jensen just salting the wave safety that there's nobody had and look at that satisfying death ray Autos the last one in 65
