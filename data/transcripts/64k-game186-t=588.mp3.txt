just got check to see if everyone's why we're going to draft into the first raptor games flights on Whose life skp on read and I have two questions for dress with the akali problem and how do they do with the Renekton problem to why is Katie took the right side of town is repeated if it was however I want to be heartbroken Pantheon it is flights which team is somero and its effectiveness of camping pool between multiple positions if you believe I can fly I can playeverything is really interesting that we just do the elite Ava normally people would take it back blade pain delete a file a complaint against him so much of this one of these best pick up and I love AP junglers on the Chiropractic to the Delta allow you to have so much more braided with your soul and other things to be such a high priority very threatening overall just seeing if I could take it right off the bat there of course of SIA already been the case already picked up and has really shown has been be Nautilus and the threat in the seems like a clear-cut often that you are picked to try at spider strategies and knows that she has a decent match of into trash however I think this would be the priority vehicle and KKexciting all the same spot like completely cracked open near Comfort pick to make sure that one of these guys can grab it there was an honest man and it looks like North Darren with the sacrificial lamb not get one of his Comfort Inn North Iroquois be playing on the back foot of whatever Champion he's able to grab out of 2nd and Pecos in that might still be a cashier for the Braven fan right there now with the gang click and we know it's going to try to cheat days is one of the chance that would have you been out you and I would like to eatpicked up just because they'll make me on the test they want to see a v e v competition coming at you get caught in the net day someone will fold down an incident necessarily want to run a tank so I think this might be a little bit of NJ Champion that could work at the Olive * if you see and a leased Russians Raven if you ever get wave management down there on sats the potential to set up a dog without a lease a really terrifying if you see the way. Katy from diving that it is very dangerous. That type of champion on top of the Gangplank ultimate if coffee is post level 6 answer right away hovering aroundtake me back to illusion so it does look like they are reserved in canopy how about another one of these flexes the sat in the States but if there is a good matchup might be able to take that one that what's the alarm Bells run off of North Tarrant, Warwick and volibear every single time for his longtime friend is not something that I expected Now you're scaring haven't been the best of his permit terms apply execution Champion you don't have to hit the hook but I would like him to hit some of them as much a plate in the bottom line already I think that I'm blitzcrank David also the additional range of blood prankscan actually set up a lot of making plays over maybe then I suspect it might be willing to go to something like letendre despite the fact that he's having quite a few shows that I recognize the lack of engage they needed to Safeway to be able to play for backing up and taking a look at the SATs composition visicom that really thrives on 1 and 2 item power cycle this is the consequence snowball and cowardice especially well it's actually they ever get priority controls at Midway and start involving Faker in the silence which he's on the sondre in here because you talked about being able to roam over but you got types of Blitz having a battle against Ravens and undercurrent if you want to blaze out comes downon the road welcome to summoner's Rift for the first quarterfinal match of the day underdogs of put splice the third team out of Europe congrats for making the world huge bras for getting out of the group but you are up against a the best team in the world and SK Telecom T1 the Juggernaut to South Korea the lck Champions three-time World Champion make it to yet another world semifinal and level 1 Shenanigans I'm not going to pay off and that means are we going to have a very standard early game we speak about this a lot but if sat to have the same composition 122 Wadhams I do want to have a good early game burden is on Thursday on the side of splice to be able to do his thing this is a jongleur that European analyst speaks so highly of because when he does come on top of the drift he's able to control the state of the game trinket reset and now has a sweeper and on gragas yes you can go for a full clear and then grab your Predator boots between your top side and bought side jungle but you can also look for early level 2 Gang by using that sweeper and denying Vision on the other side though he's against Clay probably be best jungler in my opinion at this tournament and so vital to bridging SKT from early to mid game of the tournament most people have played as novel one right now and I think that I'll be very interested to see how he plays his early again cuz we seen a lot of a lease and I think at least into current champions in the jungle is actually quite good too scary shows that Alicia's able to meet to say on in the only game I would expect to be pretty Elise David So if I will see you when that is going to be the case I do want to mention this middle a match up one more time I know that you mentioned that this is a flame that we've seen historically we did stop seeing a little bit because the cooldown went off on lissandra away play what kind of shot a little bit and have become incredibly High did they shoot be a lame that humanoid as long as he is able to trade well and set up games free jungle with very good Wave Control the other winning match at Fred's Hayti is Converses chalky up there we know that Lucien is a great counterpick into a dangling because of how we can deal with the barrels on his passive double shot or two DoubleTap there and is also the potential of a possible. I've skating place are punished all the time globally not necessarily in the LEC until they think they can Coast through a lot of people ain't and get to that big Bank Plank moment you can see clear on the way pigs when you're with Annalise you need to respect the potential to Dive Right Now Tri-Cities visitor it pretty close to HP the papers already Adeline 3 minutes today's order for the tops of the courthouse in place down does spotting look at these red vinegar to look at the farm that talk to you is not allowed to get in range for the evolution of SKT to MSI has been fascinating to track at that tournament first to fight in the bottom softener you'll be punished if they don't have the proper support be set up was there's a path from top to bottom side because that's where the kill pressure is face think that Chachi can just throw up the brick walls but as Haiti come slamming through and you can see right now that Chucky is just trying to survive as long as possible pick up as much pain he knows he's going down with actually the play on the flip side of the map 3 summoning spells that Splash to be able to go for but I want to just throw it back to what I was saying sat vs. G2 fake app freezing the lane on the as is and cats taking over the entirety of the map of MSI this time it's the only reason he's trying to get himself a favorable shop NCS late and take us just pieces out of the lane impact somewhere else I would have went out what the actual result was no because it's 3704 splice two three bench press Katie just in the bottle dive in figures with a full minute Top Lane in the midst vs is equal all that time spent answer is a kill and has no difference in it I shouldn't feel good right now nothing nothing actually happened four slices is the only problem there this is what happens when your players are pound-for-pound veteran situation that should favour you just means you caught up with what the game was the lck consistency of taking their moment. Timers Wave Control up visiongain they're so disappointed it means that they don't expose himself to mistakes and I get to punish yours absolutely and I think that the difference of this sat lineup on the international stage is it also a little bit more willing than we've seen in the past that throw down early they will take some more of those 5 second wind chill for a minute has certainly shut up and so far is Worlds you can just see they are way more active on summoner's Rift idea that in the lck domestically since there's a higher Baseline of fundamentals team can recognize stronger so they going to try and push it in this most of the time we just made no secret of the phrase however I cannot find a way to leave put in a bit of damage but God is going to get a second kill the game and a play like this is just so rough to watch because it would have more than one member coming up to try and break that breed an epic opportunities like this on the international stage to punish inexperience came out of apartment so it is going to be holding against Chachi to get this to bounce into the wave but as he read it say not yet they killed him they continue to snowball I mean and it's just so many things that you would question about this play the fact that Chachi had telephoned available that he could have come back with items and now it's not going to stop doing suppose but they might have changed over the road. Lucia you have no flash the way it is frozen again see right now you're just being hard tonight and it's at least it's just setting up shop in your land this is freedom health gone this is the ultimate feels bad moment I think they caught it level 6 can melee kill him whenever you want so this is a nice to have right now. I think that this is an area of SKT the people bought my faves political, on the international stage certainly had some pretty acrylics out that was at the health to be clear right it isn't a 3-minute dive over at level three and then you know clicks but he wants out of here as well but hey if you spend the time results come in maybe that's a good job he got the kills if you're looking from splices lens what can I help get back on the map to make it worth the fact that it is Itachi and she's in the grave right now he's trying to dig himself out which you have to make something crack on the bottom line or in the midline is a split math happening right now she really cheating out of the mid lane as well admit him and they will be able to take the entirety of the Jungle but looks like they want the time flashing still gone get City bottle by throat they're going to look for the hook and effort kites back and looking like reports are coming over there as we've got to take her right to the river with a route to buy some extra time with enough time time for round to walk away old lost a very well play from FHA they even prevent preserve fake is black and a lot of that is the fact that shot speak no evil see no teleport available where is condyles have it so that you would say wet pasta Torrid time would be time will be able to teleport down there just is so strong right now on this week that was pretty hot to get something to put on two different ones and they haven't gotten
