unguarded play a very deep and in opposition the hebrew heavily on the jargon jungle that was on your plate well it seemed quite split bolts believe how are you will just will the game on the one that would look that might be here long on top for the worldwide law and get a permit average losing out on the whole block you'll see why hundred all love and they would across over a hundred and power wielded over to how to find that that we're seeing other things to do to stop that war by one of the tenth july third at the two half times the current national average house will be back before her points the break that was when they were on blue side now what does that guarantee counterfeit for big maybe they wanna hold their lavoie who wore the way they fix till later the fact of life going guys have had enough of that have i've read it and got away for yet i read the verdict mcmanaman see what it's worth a few of the us of course into off the table my question not want you about what's that the study of a european while some holders that old audience have continued they are a dear friend of just been poisoned revenues are out there in the world through the game while they have what ought to get work on an old one octave lucio been able to fill us in upon them some of what i fear is that what yeah i think that if the focus on the spot awaits you see there early tactics to get a strong bond up one for themselves the people really like to break that really sucks on lane but this is quite well with the cctv that brings up on top at plowright in the weight on this were picked up right now will a expect to see some blueberries there but flight was due really really like teenage rocks been for so long used for elaine dollars and reviews gave had with pressure and all that simply did you buy an overall that in a bottle of pills of lucille lot of worldly and i'm out but as the day is not resolved not what's going on to the warm so i'm not really sad but but within the city of various regions of the jungle we didn't have it as an old one of its whitlock in liverpool blew the gap is alloy that pick them three zero is weak dying to get in here in the playoffs defying all odds with the aegean it back or would have still the biggest gonna be springs what sort of trying to agree with you for the tickets and i think that was so is it if you'd like no other vowels what the law of raines said you have affected its when it looked for these bubbles up over the wall of ice picks of a game guys good went it local guards wanted to hit that bare earth bottom line even of f. b. i.'s doesn't go without the full low fat selectivity that uses a pet quite well with zoe what ought likewise that the satellite in orbit that gates will want a play about a very authentic used his last word and i also reported on top of it al assad was that and a nice whispering that the leaves on how was your as like this really frightened and widening gulf war was to blame one another for the jungle or end and you know that was the white dwarf they wanted to get more for themselves that they actually work as there is some tents let's grab the woods great let's join the contents in a flurry of ours that he made his eighties to what deal will kill them both now to should've you really wanna go slack key bugle was the bullets right at the books and get doubled its close and even after the philippine fighting i made us one over and then we're delighted to get it what's it about what is the right guy for for themselves with him to the warrant and they boarded ozark where is observers you know what was the first victim jumbled towards the right as the news the white the video of themselves and their twin brother john were in and he obviously wants that that somewhere and act out of the vp that are but they just assault doing so what you can buy the gate is our side after trying to get a lot of extra pressure when you've got a what's going to lift the plane point out that top claim there's something off since here for senate floor to shine through it so mad he is one of these five tumblers they've been putting in the work of gay talese then comes across the pantheon we have my life goes in for the quietly for meetings relatively peacefully in the first game these were hiding from me if i'm right here where the road really really powerful wrote regular season and we say in work clothes and all through all of rome to his lip huge showing in the first one to north america big primary crippled unguarded they still work longer on t. v. as well thou thy covenant with the power of evil grabs a pass and that going back and read together pick freak read that for likewise the this game they oui to see this elway and then lock civic activities that heavy that you really have backpack be used either read about it and be that picked up at it because otherwise if this guy gets an attack that harassment not later than the fur kills over and over in flat with a bozo elite enjoying our people very complicated is cast it in that thereby this is another champion that it would be that we thought already in the last impart evil doing almost half of these thieves get its forty seven points out the present to the center this is ridiculous and activity here with you this yellow color bit later in the game doesn't go off into quite as early as the block again dude but this time in the flight quest is super carried howard you all and the thing is that the early game wasn't they usually about how are you louis about wildly dark blue or less when the two of you had thought he would the scrolls go to the early drake it what is a solo not an assistant with one of what toppling with the party big on the beach rocks and then yeah pew we basically for p. leaders golden glue that we got a big game and he we took over the game and gordon does not find a way that was the cast and is closer cannot find a way that honors our bills gas and then if the beauty i think will newbold gonna be hard pressed to find a way about this report is seen today that you we take the bull the semi assassin or beecher thousand in just take a good game with with mobility jars look to the already so on the summers arrived shortly we're going to go as thou we wait for about a bill that are the good side reasons again in real time there was the remake on the game but i get all excited to see who'd come out ahead on that is what i did not die his everyone reads a clue pro teams have it needs your below the board that was what concert with the first gate is look like was made of islam but what's really not thy should be i think a very strong that i think he has got the reed theory reliable wingate she's really really take the yielded to get rid of course but i think he's very strong i think it'll look good over all of this game i want to see that the reason that you go there with the was equal to get in at midway in the wed couple of days because it happened before local six does not have the mobility it is a geek magnet i wanted to look exactly like it completely agree the forecast and its global six and has access to the extra cash from ripper flock we see it is very good at attacking this champion tom has freed good attacked image early on in essence not theory well armor so so we can lay in a global ever or trying to help set up something that they can attack accident but the party will place it intelligently and also santorum on a pantheon conquerors made them and i can get very dicey because few overextended and beyond is very good attorney missouri yeah i gotta do was to become legible lot we had the first to start with it a well time conveyed by golden guardians down the bonds of about three fourths of shorn off his reading forced him to go to crowds and the day you that you don't lose traded kids back and forth and you got a great exhausted till maybe thirty minutes or so when one hour we had a first book talks like that comfortable roland per view we would allow concert but honestly was it was that about t. by crowds were closer founded not god's be found guilty uses a lot people women said torn from bits bytes of these around the city target for deer are incredibly incredibly early new book is the good part to focus the one copy of the most important all this pantheon to look really really good begin looking for slightly pressure be someone tries to match how rude people in the cycling champion cups water with a top thousand killers on me that our right let's get out of area then they are ready to spend this is gonna be an action packed early game as well as avoiding the eyeballs on the woods crank up one of the affairs of over one from flightless some sort of the way to date i'd do you see a sweeper on a dark night at the devoted would you do have plans to go for these early invades because very often and team is when they see an important would spring will leave a lot of defensive works early on and they will expect those boots they die they tried to be on the ground with a bullet through the corridors show himself would have to okay now the work of the yacht a giants that by going guardians all quiet superstar for the varsity the brush bauza up they just simply walked right back down at the and meat is recall goes back to the map and alludes to go for that bob's idea what did happen is not really on the week with a good for portals bought the jungle that sense of closure goes to the red up to date it's gonna be spotted bolts believe we don't have the big by flights must look at the biblical gurney's would you and don't use race get closer to the that getting leash about the top of that is the author didn't invest in cuba that there are so low that used to live with each of them forth will say they've started to do more damage early on some of the faster birthday present for the clothes the facts outside starts to flow of death of what can you expect the early exit bell bottoms to revive of talk about that plane woke to like the things it shot that's pretty obvious reason that though it's pretty easy to both he and his top fast even if they see the woefully out of my life despite all your lot though if we have the vivien levy it three thousand is that at ten p. c. of the prophets a beverage trade with guarded by your top or thank almighty feel i'm with the favorite to the prime of life is not the the identity of my driver rotblat right no we're health and haul it out while that go when did you have i think the bottom line at least are likewise for the first wife yeah i like him that address of ascetic life of my teddy barbie death jungle death rates and the odds stand for in the highlight on him and looking for early place we go straight from tops i've read off all the way the lifeguard at the bottom side where we're looking for some bottom wave action and fly quest do not disappoint the guy who was left with great way to help npr's jungle this is that all those overly aggressive said for the weights for the fbi feel more comfortable after the top five is used for beating his wife friday if they go straight for various they know that there's no possible fowler any other spells because it's the level one that gets you decided that some laughed so they get the second flat out on top of it and it is setting up a big lead here for awhile ago in a bar with the coolest of what's crank know most of us those for anybody on the bottom happened back then is your voice will be our last phillies inoculated you we of course have made late forever born with the witness should be expected this lull play the fact lose the little yon it means that the public in rome they get caught or controlling its total control of the weasel little something on the fourth of old guard but this is gonna be a rough one has to feel the middle of the forming in nearly equal indeed c. twenty one importance yes that's going to the five thousand of the first one bottling looks great and very frankly look a little boys that they have like plus the fact that faith has missed them around they're the ones with the bottom line control and with the coolest thing you'd think plan for like west it's the kind of support the last game where found that it dragons they've worked with the for the trifles found only have got here is the thing that you were just going over the way that if it's so different way passes it really does need more time to scale at golden we hear on the so we should be able to help out with the philosophies in this area of the math it's really only the early films have possibility of blitzkrieg who was the play's the thing for the stuff that thoma souffle keep happening as they are watching each other or drive that they include waves of southside to guess i'd have taken care of all that they friday i mean reluctantly right at the drivers of saying no one should be dying here on sunday is running out of man and he
