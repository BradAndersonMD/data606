this is the game everyone came here for Team Liquid versus Cloud9 at the top of the standing patio already off the band phase deer this the champion A Team Liquid actually got more than any of the other teams and I was expecting to be from a bad it was before the nurse even came in this game. You must have been at themselves as well as the Kindred with both of these players have had very big plays on in their professional careers the number to see if the final bands coming through you notice the map that both these things were looking at for a probably more than just this week but they did the previous week as well and really pulling into with a fat is Steve who would win this fight and she knows a lot of talk about these two teams practicing against each other most because the top teams generally form clumps of scrims and bottom teams for more clumps of trims Canada day they definitely come to know each other fairly well I'd say so I'm super excited to see how that plays on stage and more becoming a school support for the Jays played at the single time in fact the only galio player on his team right now as far as current split LCS we know for the completed what is unlikely so I can grab quickly here in court today I believe has one of those pins for himself I want to play it on one of my favorites will sneaky play these is skin the Wilds give ruler a shout out to movie the lovers do although in a round lock in here for a dancer like the Allosaurus 100% off and that's where galio is not nearly as a thank-you or have the surprise Factor without the flash that can really punish a wreck on the same way those other two can so that's why she not old enough to go with this double locking it was good of a Lanner galaviz I agree he's not super tank Elissa get darker after sucks that futon you can play around but if he does land into the the right afterwards. Seuss toxic I see if you can actually a low House camping but it's one where you have to play Aqua to make that work and a person I was that are fun the tall guy charged up to get a bigger area there for myself and speed is a bigger measured against when you're against to work on let's see you do a block and a J's have both been blocked in base to me has been just an extreme power pics on this patch and it actually goes through to the second round of a fixer I think that's very happy there 14 liquid be able to pick that up it's flexible between multiple lame and not necessary it doesn't have to necessarily go up against the Sandra I do think it would be strong liquid have going on right here is even if Space Coast Melanie pointer Pitbull stop playing. Kaiser with a decent match profile is up still as well to look in a lease or a Fraga spell you're not hemmed into one damaged by if they have old with flexibility here and not connecting to be really nice for you because you know you can move that Jace Crown you can put them done before as well alright Garvin & LeBlanc. The table here for cloud nine bending away we expect impact to pick up a tank so maybe not the dates but he is also played a lot of bruises very effectively and he has also had that game on the chase where he did the currency was able to take down to Turks with no Champions defending them so I guess you could get up maybe a little happy face sticker for that you or outflow you how you talk to me to grab here though and that's where that can still go jungle or Tom plane so she not going to wait to see what comes through and make sure they get the match if they want him looking out to show their entire lineup and I think that's both misky and licorice have had very strong games on Xbox that would like to see you one of these solo laners take it flickers have an amazing flank around to win the game for them versus Sam Hart engaged Smith's gas Wellhead solo kills against who in the mid lane and they were able to win that game as well so I really like the fellow in a box pool Cloud 9 Spa near locked in both those players that the jungle players very thick as well does work very well with Jay-Z can go melee form and stack is the sun's a very swiftly effected Jace looks like it's going to the top when is Oriental be the match of indocin Drake here after we're doing this thing to LeBlanc band from earlier on so Cloud 9 now know their matchups is it a trucks in 2 days or does it go to Jungle you pick a different counterfeit York my go to report that was banned a way to look at don't want to see that match up at all for themselves the licorice what is your pick against the thing he's going to go for the old call back maybe poppy used to be so going to Jake's Wayback the day you just simply with Spam the damaged forever and you skilled infinite tank if you never wanted me like you want you to be really good against good against Calio good against this brings me back to 2018 when Liquors was first put on cloud nine and we're talking about him being that carry flare-up in the top side of him trying to grow into tank they comes out Terry's Cloud 9 when they're having a rough time switch in a lot of their star player is between the academy team copy of a massive laning phase for himself in the ones you have. He made a lot of plays a good length to get those charges into the wall off the champion I think it's just so good into the Team Liquid line up we saw into the interview is at the Players outside the parking lot has a really good idea to give licorice to beat Team Liquid with so good against the five Champions Hoover be single long cool down Dash to really don't want to lose out on the kit and I take a chance again be a good thing. Plane takes a penis but who's going to win the battle for control of first place we've been here lots of players get ready smile to the face it just one Jensen vs. nisky the first time around Team Liquid and Jensen get the advantage to waiting and here's your second chance summoner's Rift here we are in first place Cloud 9 in second but that could all change about 40 minutes here at the base Gates drop let's see what the level insanity is North America's best domestic and international performing teams going head-to-head right now for a lot of ragging rice but also a very big step up in the standings as far as who will likely finish in the first place by if you would get their head-to-head Victory here you know winning both games in the regular split versus Cloud9 it was very hard to knock them down the standings they would have to lose to the other teams that have to lose three of the next five games and they just haven't done that. Of course we do have a word with the Cloud 9 coach about this match thanks guys Reaper Team Liquid versus Cloud9 now you have trained them both Jensen vs. nisky who is the superior midliner they don't like the loan they want to stay to meet so I think Cinderella better matchup into Rihanna so this time around missed you can shut down Jensen this time around all right well this time around that's the game that counts Weber thank you and good luck back to you guys but I like the way he said that it was better they both like to stay in Lane Seaford we all know you think Jess is better Rihanna match up to me has been so interesting because as reproduce alluding to the Centrist does have an element of kill pressure versus the Oriana for a lot of the game you know when she hit that level six or and it does have to watch out for that but there's a reason Oriana stop to pick in the center here we go at level one that has the Red Bluff Karen also playing against his old teammate there goes too deep under the tower as soon as I started I could have had that feeling you do as a jungler if you do this sometimes diving in our Solar late is just too deep you're not going to be able to get that kill there's a heel on the hill or barrier they are winning as we have seen so often but let's take another look at this Howard I. Spence Karen make a red bus level 2 Gang versus old mid laner then goes in deep doesn't hit it and that wasn't even the 3rd one yeah so nosey flashes right that's for sure kill if you flash the right distance but he's all right overshot it well down to Mechanical Miss play their then off mechanics that's a heartbreaker what happens here and it's a 500 goal difference for the other first Blood you don't get quite the full of cysts cool very early on to the game and it is a 700 gold lead now for team liquid is in fact not blame but ourselves matchup it only took about four levels to turn around and Poppy would become invisible shield Craig's away and your nose is probably missing Yankee pick up the little babies you left behind I believe maybe 20 goals in his pocket but as we started talking about the bottom way once again doublelift and chords JJ be the best bottom line in the entire league that we have they're pushing up against a Zone Stevie that got it for themselves early on they either way it would go up and get this fellow crab which is not a huge benefit of having a winning bottom when they saw this young Killers go mid so they knew they had a free route or to Scuttle crab to get even more money and safety and vision for themselves to the workout has played for the jungle cake yes but as you were saying Papi year for licorice has been such a strong Champion even though it is a tank here we go full reindeer on his own certainly there's no way to write what has been wrong for in fact they get the kill back and pushes in the lane and incense candles as you decide you want to go up on the top side so he shouldn't get the next bottom stuttle at sponsee or try and get some more safety for the C9 Duo that one right back it was five cs plus $2 craps at Freddy's bought lanes and now they're about the same spot I got a lot of experience while these minions and wild licorice died in the topside it was pretty much a full level up over has been scanned there since gusting level 4 office cut off so the atrox a little bit behind an experience as there a BofA trying to Output early pressure in this game the game is still 700 ahead Team Liquid doing a good job is it straight out from there as the cleanse for a later stage one again and we've hit that level six Mark where the guy has huge fuel pressure on the Oriana Soriano tries to stay back Dodge confused fun to just go for the CSI what's the first star recalls on a plane as well stick he's been to the Tire man in full so could be here that he goes for it as the other bodily will inherit a Cantu wave it is not unlike most pro games you can make whatever you want and you can actually this one is actually pretty good Regal timing here it's pick up stubble longsword Beaver force was buff back in 9.4 so if you don't lose that much priority Russian the item first compared to like a BF sword Infinity Edge push and it should be pretty reason it should be pretty easy match for early on helping her make you soak a big birthday image in her kit if you can go for a trade I don't know how much you need the manor refund can spam it's very use it away from your old man a fool doing it but you don't have to but it feels good regardless we are going to see his whining shown on those Wards The Observers passed over in the red jungle hear those words actually going to pay double dividend drugs either Gallo from here after recall very common for the for the 10-minute Mark 4 supports boo head out to a different Lane rather than heading out through bottom that's the go on help your jugular with Warden Brad maybe make a pass at Genki 1 of the solar wind is there in 15 fishing here now sequani is going for the invite and had faded way around this might be coming around nice job get away from that one something away just the flash came through is the courts take down a Summoner all right definitely going to be a little bit more vulnerable here on the galio not level 6 get either so you can't help out with a jungle invented they do suspense Karen but he's got the timing hair do on the flu should be able to get it low enough might be a pretty close if going to be almost
