optic very close to the standings 5 and 5 vs 4 and 6 liter of these rosters this one so far enough the band list as well when does see that that's pride and crew North American knock from a Trucks Band it off tickets to the Indy actually think there's no pics that are competitively viable that beat him in Lane Self you know it is one of those required bands right now unless someone is willing to actually really put in the time to repair a strategy against a rock to try to shut us down then we're probably not going to be good but not going to run around that didn't work quite well leave a truck stop in of course yes instant first pics of dhokla versus darshan and if they know I've got something for you and he's going to say it's a percentdead from Newcastle were in the NLCS earlier today that would be very exciting I do think there are some matches that I can actually I do fairly well they found my soul acute into the atrox minutes lucarelli well into aatrox icg or do very well the errand is another one has Billy going to see all of those sorts of pics on the LCS stage especially because people just dealing with which is not really working in this metal that is much more about drinking and fighting. Which makes it very difficult for someone like a few Arthur really have to accept you if you're doing well as laying play defensively sacrifice Lane a little bit give that up in some ways and I'm kind of looking for more of a reason later threw in in later right now off to get blocked in what I consider to be number one comfort for gold Acadian and arrow at 8:18 grades at super good his best camping air I think definitely didn't is that as well I don't think I've been quite to the samehe was back on Phoenix one but on David like the Braves game actually I'll just look for a gadia that he has been a longtime Pro player has been absolutely excellent on it the trundle as well as the rakan here for CLT Trumbull is fine even if there is not a true tank picked up biotic but don't let has really been say want that to go if it was talking about what is actually kind of walking off to can do much more with split push style of play what are the reasons that this is so effective is that it's so damn easy to actually Perry and stun the a dropped off of one of the sweet spot on the Q how you can also do in the early to Q's the first and second you can actually Dash inside of that sweet spot on the floor and start engaging in that fight when the third Pew for the big damage comes upread that very easily and you can kind of continue forward in that all in that being said a truck can still push in and look to bullies if you're in the early levels I thought sometimes big forward to some time to get going as we all know that I wanted to see the opening of the match up when we started seeing aatrox Rift Rivals I got fewer what's going to be the one we seeing if you're in trouble for I know you mentioned earlier lot of frozen dumplings in the viable option to end game but we saw the echo Fox Renekton in a row a lot of things a different result was good for was the one I want to hear midnight but I know we really see much as so kind of interesting that they are actually Banning out of the Heimer despite the fact is about laying her was already picked Baby Huey has been kind of using that in scriptis the current one of the guys to be willing to actually get to mix things up a little bit more in that regard I do have a bra on paired up with the gym though a pretty stable steady bottom Lane and they want them sort of a leaf along with the team and I think it does make sense especially with double Marksman Braun always were so curly well blocking out damn it for them as well as being a flu private passive which they can then Fox News on the squad good story out of the picking for who he in the Middle Lane which means we know where most people are going but 20 seconds ago for the last pic I don't expect to LeBlanc cover but who knows already bought let it go see if you was 6 days late but he has been here for CLG fan the weather can't work on but as real force a pretty big Mainstay for 6 people tie his most played at 3 now Oriana not a surprise or who he either still do planksrecently a bunch of Charmed race in the early game is the major benefits are so many cops while I do believe so already back in the mix power of you bringing that one out of here with that you're into HR to the stop sign. Worldwide a once in North American Academy and once in awhile but either way it won both games do me very excited see how this thing doesn't go down high-risk high-reward Optics adopting into a split push style play with your filter have drafted for an assassin here on the re whichafraid if they fall behind the game is likely to end pretty quickly definitely is going to be some to wash for Wayfair not the strongest strength on the opposite side either way as we are loading into this one optic came into the day alone in ninth place on the outside looking in hoping to find their way up Fords in the standing expectorate they had the same still outside looking in. So far the Springfield open make it a little better now is that come in throughout summer missed playoffs 7th place finisher in Spring split 5 and 5 yearhyper V would make it towards that first place spot hoping to make it towards that world's run their third title also worth noting optic running for TPS still Jeep running 100 pretty Stark differences there on what the two teams are trying to do as as we said optic is kind of opting in to Morrisville push style spread the map be able to have that Wave Control it all time in the sidelines and 40 piece is going to help you do that. The question becomes are you at too much of a disadvantage because of all these additional combat Summoners can you not then when your legs because of that I mean it's double, Simon Earth you have the healing ignite for CLG how you would hope if they could then utilize that's going to get some more of an advantage on the bottom of the map but you can't force an all-in TV is going to be more effective if it is as it was one of the very first ones to bring teleport. Lena dimensional Marksman and it caught on for other champagne afterwards but the idea was rushing back to your first year at in a 750 gold or whatever in and stacking up quite early on to the game I do think he'll make scored me two cents in his composition though there's a lot of burst coming out of the optic Squad and either generally you're probably going to be lit if you don't die instantly you probably have a good ability to recover and then win that fight against Champions like Fiora and so on and we are going to see if you were actually playing in grass grass is pretty pretty standard these days actually work your adopted a nap very easy to just constantly use your cues dashing forward and with that lunge and you're always out of the medians of the grass is always ready and then you're trying to jump forward rocket vital praca grass and you have to essentially that's the only real trading you use just these cues on pulled out but it can be very very effective and it's very frustrating actually to Lane against describe one way that Katie and I think I'll ever won for the goat or down in that River brush and I got scared out straight or fighting over the scuttles tonight is up for both players or 10 picked up my scent of the help I drop a little Portuguese can I see sometimes with the auto tech grab stops cuddling occasion waste a few second trimester happen during that Scuttle away from Acadian as he is training it down he just making sure to stay on the bottom side to push it up two words with that top side of the river and there is that way I'm talking about dashing in progress Proctor pie dough that's what you're trying to do, but even with his kind of advantageous match up again as I said HR can put you in early HSN I have a Laney advantage in those early phases and you are cats supposed to be expected so there's not a lot of damned if you don't follow up with an auto attack but at least mine just done maybe get a little bit back there is Farm Credit back and forth yeah we should be who he spot that I can take him to the Raptors away but can't stop him and I still use one chicken back to eat that came from responding and it keeps seeing ghosts poros come down for those who do have the domination tree ran over looking for the stuff on the side of the map and you'll find Crocs the end of the day Saphira and you have a truck was just really can be very powerful in the early phases do not get them back with the w but he has to take over the dive that carry Beyond cooldown rate over should honestly could get over there forget about the wave in her walking towards the champion so I think you need to finish the way the trip so hard driving without having taking it so hard it is tough but at the same time they're not giving him time for the repose to come back up as well so level four. To teleport out and the threat of the reprieve going to be enough but I may be waiting for that supposed to be back up could have been too much a TV started them canceled Peewee keep steamed it a lot it's tough right it's hard to know what is the right decision to make in that moment but no generally I feel that if you are trying to go for early dive against if you are all that were both similar with Jackson's all about the counter strike that defensive tool is really what they have to keep them alive and you know that they canceled TV coming out from power of evil is something especially when you have to remember 60 seconds even on that cancel so he's not going to have that the comeback for Lane and it does hurt his laying a decent amount these guys that would teen said that Optics morale and everyone on the team is pretty happy after 420 from last week he says that they're pretty confident draft that they have right now and that they've been working on it all week so then who he is going to have some trouble against Peohe's in Uwharrie cuz he's going to bring that back into the meta back to you guys very cool stuff and they should be confident coming off of a very very strong weak because shown also it in these pics write the fact that they're willing it to take for your into the detox leaving it up and also going with the sorry and I'm going to be very powerful fix get played very well and that's funny because while there is Champions like you must been a lot of times that results in prose not practicing it because you're so powerful they like well no one's ever going to let me play it but why would I waste my time put again in practice games so when you do that leave it up you were expecting that do glass spend time this week screaming this exact match up bright and perfecting this exact match up in you offer darshan there's a chance he didn't play a single game of it this whole weekend a very high chance he is not played this matchup this week so your backyard come and go in the favor of the team that has prepared this strategy and I will always respect believe this but we think we have the answer and are willing to make that risk I do love that especially if you are on the outside like optic are it's even more reason to do that because you need to check something up a little bit slow but not quite the rest of it here so far holding equal in laying again because he concern was planning to use is unbeatable and so far holding up his fight even getting ganked once is dokha of course the power to get shifted a dark running late game Powers going to be that must be banned or you think that you are certainly is going to have the scaling invented there you know these bites should just the better and better for a few are as time goes on and certainly are going to want to try to play around that try to get dhoka his advances at least protect him and that's all I make sure that he can't get though can't get ganked because if you do get behind it's going to be rough neck we try to be forced into joining those he fights a reason that people really happened kind of avoiding the slip Bush's darshan still do your very eyes trade with hitting sweet spot on to q's and deathbringer stances getting natural a grievous wounds application which is pretty big butt Acadia is in the area they have a thing for it in the river though power of evil roaming out there trying to make a free man play I'm going for a 302 trundles right around the corner going to pick up Alaska and waiting to join the team that black Konya is up and that's not going to happen dope looking incredibly tired I really be gone for a little bit of damage no naka says yes so pulling aggro Joe's walk away from that one and only get half course that's after you open it will take for the Dive Right now I got a hard to kill yeah becomes all about the Perry the facts indicating comes over though does protect him and that's a very big allowing him to stay around and actually collected waved at the experience of gold now they're going to try to go around the closest angostura bitters slow right now 240 turn around the tower dive. Just checking flash out of the third Matrix avoiding so
