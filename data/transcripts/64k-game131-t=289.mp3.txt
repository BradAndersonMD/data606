Immortals are part of the Zoop every team Bagley has five or six wins and Immortals will have five or six wins as a day's blg with the dubious honor of being in last they just beat us a day weekend in earlier today also picking up their second wind so often considered pretty good weekend has been a really rough flip for the Oreck but we're all looking I think a lot better since they got pobelter we saw some is blaming SAS but that's was talking about him I think he's had three straight really solid laning phase is Acropolis games he has been looking strong and in the Victor game yesterday got player of the game it was really all about him in the later stages he dominated that game against TSM and that was the first time I really saw him take a good morning face and turn that into a game Victory So Cal turfcan you compete Immortals as well as the one where it was my sin just like ran down there Nexus movie look who's in a winning situation in the first place so do you want to do the early to mid game looks like it's obviously sitting at a much better record for their on a four-game losing they went for 5 and 225 in the sticks so yes field has been the worst team overall on the split but you know in these last couple weeks are the only thing that has a lot of these two and they did take down one of the teams that a lot of people were considering one of the best in the league in TSM so we'll see how they're going to be able to perform here today was it a fluke or can they really start to get some consistency with this roster who would like this and see him always happy when there's a lot of teams fighting for the pots with all the teeth feel pretty good and seam seal Jane do better with make me happycalories in if nothing else to be locked in a room down here is be a smelly husband of Sarah suppose gaunt's then also dropped as well but knew from the very beginning we're going to go to the support and you go and pick up the suspect real life because we're having the ADP player you know the bottle warmer play it so people are our kind of a bit shocked by that that is turning things around and also the other mix-up I would say that you're expecting to be support but alongside a more traditional Mark Spitz writing style Champion guess what it's actually pretty good to have down there in that bottom Levi wiki wiki farmingI was surprising I think they're from the 20th has to talk to you connected with said when he's a negative resistance is it makes you incredibly Tanki and you're going to win any of those kind of wine do you want style tools do is jungle match up there for a trundle feeling pretty good about that guy has called I would argue without looking at the most lifetime from games of any LCS player actually I'm sure we can get that checked out but without looking I will agree with you at all but look pretty good for him to talk about to pass to go we argue no pushing forward to take medication as well we can expect to get down there being locked in until g-side so yeah it's going to see hima lot more overtime as well and makes me a good front line and then you're going to have a decent all of damage before snap their I also really like the pairing of triangle with Ms Turnbull was played us at 4 to ask you because you can feel her people spoil them down and kind of block them fairly easily into this whole time is that ultimate no making that even easier for I have to get an effective sink light off because it's not fine if you're right on point with it but feeling bands coming out here for CDLslooking to have to protect the van I was going to say is played two games of his ear and the one Victor game he did show yesterday if they want to blow their Midland right here and make them so they're going to lose midlane bins out just save that last car fixed or ruin by with a trucks coming through you do expect that to go top for ruin this is just a very standard blanket that people are really comfortable with you know most of the matchups that actually are very very difficult grade rocks and abuse porch. And people aren't really playing split Bush so people are so happy to play the atrox when you think about Camille we think about Jackson you think about no Quinn and all these Champions that it was you were playing another example right so if you are willing to play that style then it can be very good but there you goCamille I like how 4 weeks I've just been like that why people just take this another one time like while they're not going to take a break I really do not feel quite a bit I do think that Camille is a very favorable matchup into that eat rocks brunch OKC last year and actually quite effectively so we'll have to tell also as can do in this matchup but it can be very difficult for HR quick trades utilizing the physical damage are very very effective in 28 Rockton he talks down to offer will be preferential with the trundle there you have some consistent one line damage also with Cassio and ass so I do think that the Mortal competition is very well-roundedmy favorite you know honestly incredible Shockwave here from feels he's so I do think there's a few like small point that I do like happy that you can Shock Me for knowing it escaped back and look pretty good from looking at least blackout bullet time like, sorry I was wrong to block out all the time so that there are some small thing builds you can have but I tend to agree I'd like to go to five on five especially because of that tank and snake spitting to be nearly Invincible exactly what are the things that you do if you have a composition that is actually going to win front of fighting their front line and a killer out the DPS in the back line away from getting to your back line slow down your back like UPS have free access to their tanks will there's doesn't have free access to you can be quite effective we will see if the LG can make a liar out of me in something off hereI want to watch absolutely Pulitzer his fourth game back on counter logic gaming Championship back about four or five years ago the big run made it back to their win rate took down TSM yesterday has a mortal's deflated a really exciting to watch out what they can do for Mortal self can move up to a tie for third themselves fixed winds is third place right now and would like to do is take down CO2 to get there themselves and we'll nothing working here for coz is that they did have counterpick for mid lane and I talked about how pobelter has been having really good Landing Bays has thus far the split-end he does have the counter pick into cash so you can outrange Cassiopeia and you really can get preferential trade as a result inside info from clg's can't possibly take awaythanks guys I got welding with me biggest question for CLG coming off of a huge win against TSM how are you guys going to keep the momentum rolling into this game against Immortals I think yesterday we didn't we had a pretty stable or the games we got to play a very comfortable game and I think that's at the prior to today is to to try to not messing up early so we can have a nice comfortable game I had a comfortable game where no one invades you you win all your lands and you never down and gold that's how I said I hope that's a good game yeah you know where are my games I like that you know I don't know if that's true we play do I did also because I'm maybe anything to my way to phone a couple cool things to know I was in case rash on both mid laners here I do think this is an especially smart choice for pobelter when you're going up against rely heavily on those Lowe's turn do you know you talked about the reliability of the pillar but you know this person you start running at them Auto fuw Fay's restaurant and he can just run straight out a miasma also is a very heavy slow so this is going to allow pole vaulter I think she feel pretty safe in his ability to escape cakes. I would think you reset to tasks his W-2 if you're like Auto attack reset actual attack speed games are very very small you don't tend actually say that much time to talk to yourself down because it takes so long to kill anyway yeah she probably saves a good quarter second or so I can't be doing that order it's pretty interesting it's also you will taking a little bit of damage do you can maybe get more out of the region on that wa something but does make a difference and it looks like now he is just going to try to go for a wraparound gank on mid-length here already free easy till it runs right back about that puppy superflash yeah I would think he definitely does either way though good gang right do you take what is a losing match up and that's half the help off of that lane opponent there so what is supposed to be a matter for Bob out there can become equalizer losing match up with that one little gang Domingos down Quigley is technically up a camp right now looking out of the top side is Camille is pushing in and it ruined can land this goal shots could look nice I like the forms that you know if it's not with me right now and look at that was running back with nothing could be a freeze do this connection is awesome Farm exactly this is one of those really awkward situations where you know you're not supposed agreed to walk up to the wave your but you're not sure is the jungle still there and with every two big fun comes across Alaska women out trundle is here as well as change down means first away mid John ROM dolphin pose did not answer. How is fantastic from Immortals that such an awkward position to be a Nessa talk later because if you don't step up the wave your wave will get Frozen you can be in a lot of trouble so they roll up weekly actually canceled his base not realizing that Seca en xmithie were on their way up there so ends up being the first one for them the curse is actually finish this basic yeah just didn't realize I think it would be up here for a thought he was just going to have walked back to face you know recalled and reset there as he was missing by the way first blood for a cut double Buffs on him also it's going to be a really big deal there early on conveyor belt. They would be the follow-through anyway and maybe he's right but it's more of a thousand gold Lee death of a great role the top side of the math he cannot even down Farm after all that play together stay like that where you get your full complete is deer your knee feeling really really happy that does alleviate most of your man issues as Cassio who is a very very many Hunger Champion so earlier to get that backing up and I feel really good and also is a Seraph completion does change your ability to keep I very heavily you know you are a kind of like a mid-range bottle of champagne you you have to be in range of damaged really to get the most damage deal to me very very useful to play around getting drunk heavily does toxic you that was crucial this is so much Fame is coming in nearly gets the solo kill just to hold his Flash and that is actually crazy how much damage he got there the double bus alarm to really stand out he didn't even hit a cue to start tax rate that was purely a non poison Target and he almost killed him so it does show you the power of all of that is just wrong man I thought he has with its year-end that blew off and it's going to be to tell for forced out here from pobelter where I think I should just be able to get an EZ reset after this Dragon stencil it right now it's 6:50 safe as well with the 30 most Advantage we had from the passive hope to have boots yet so just didn't make the acre run faster and it's going to look really good both solos on the immortal side feeling very comfortable by pretty quick Drake coming down as well before its run will have no problem at all so long that one out and I'm bored as hell looking awesome in this early game is the fact that before she did bring teleport and this is a nod to two-factor your landing at the Hedgerow hope you don't expect to have a tremendous amount of pressure in the early stages and most casualties day do take tp2 Aberdeen Lane to be able to get a really good bass come back and keep you shoved in and domination leaning that way so it's going to be a relatively passive Lane people in pressure of himself make it shoved into other gods that far but it's a five Cs least let's to kill putting the Early Learning stats awesome here for a cuz it's 50 no looks or the blue bus steel just reward comes down vision and now Wiggly can Toppers Light Fight their equal level and if I go to the Smithy 19
