but around 9 o soon and are a top competitor and at 73 right now I think would would like to get a play at 5 and make that final going to make that was one of the pants he's everyone's mind right now and if I'm 9 attempting to keep pace and certainly set back a little bit by the loss of licorice knows now, has been feeling him very very well I'm also interested if you're going to start to focus him a little bit more and I missed you had an interview after their first win last week where he kind of said something along the lines of Kumo yeah he's really good when he gets kind of busy play Jason both games last week will that be taken away or will you be targeted and see if if players and teams can actually exploit him a little bit so right now I can Fox not wanting to ban away the Jason probably not getting first back to your either with you me being on the table and a deed that is right there so few Mo can easily play it through Straight Jays game and blanket that into still up I will see if there's anything they want more important than thatesportlivescore would be very very strong certainly Azazel is fairly experience on the champion and Cloud Nine you know has been playing a lot of these kind of enchanteur stop. Lake Nona games to Italy in the equation as well you have taken so far let's watch coming back this origin of you you mean like Spotlight still or going to plan it looks can be played it be happy in a couple times across Pro played this year but you tend to expect in kind of plan for a being to four. Don't think she has any obscure counter picks for your life and people generally feel that there is a building a room setup the answer is most matchups for the Lost of Nevada is certainly something that they're going to have going for them you mean Lucian a setup that we have teeth do kids parties around the world but physically in any way we have to get them running this a couple times to Freight Effectiveness can be quite a strong bottom Lane do you have the speed ups for dilution to get really aggressive EV charging forward the colon can be set up well by the UB ultimate it's also in a routing number for the first time for both Lucian and you is going to be locked in now as well nisky I was very successful and there's been a lot of discussion about the mid lane meta how it's going very stale right now so much as you're so much Corky and people have been kind of boring Pros to be like all right find a break the meta well this is going to second week second of a gar pick there for Nicki and I do think that this can be a very effective champions in this sort of style if you're going to hand stick on a Farm Lane scale up with the AP utilize your passive Farm up because if you do get to those later stages if you do get to multiple items that have a ton of back on your pass if you can realistically you off some of these calories in just kill them from fully it got pretty of third you can do a lot of damage right there so now at the drive-in locked in there putting a couple of jungle Vans echo-fox also aiming for the top land range bands here as well for pretty obvious play mostly those kinds of Champions C9 will get first pick once these bands are done I still want to see if a Jays fan come through there is enough Matt Damon good luck support and Veigar mid that Jake is a bad pic and I really want that question answered if you supply the same shampoo * Android Xbox want to deal with that and then the question also is people even worried about that either they will have likely to come over Fair bed and kind of seemed to watch Champions they believed him to be the most frightening on a choc Tazewell Buckhannon argue Target stove not super worried about the days does far even though he did play it twice last week has been a very good top laner and and there are answers to the Jace so perhaps you know you are trying to bait a pic like that and and bring out a counter or bring out at wrong answer your things along the lines of York even happen if there if I could not just but has never really panned out in North America specifically when people have played it but I'm going to wait until the very end to lock in that Top Lane pick we know if we're starving text Lee can flex but I doubt that pretty highly Xbox YouTube Sewanee Inn Palos dropped off the table as real for sneaky for the Lux as real shipping Lane down there and it'll be exciting to be very safe back there in like they won't get poked nearly as hard by that has better Champion will be number 4 for the champion in a tall is a really drunken clam player and it feels pretty comfort blanket into most of matchups at the question then just becomes you is, willing to believe into it to Charter police or were they just kind of saving his Pick 4 last to protect him a little bit in the draft and make sure that he is not the one being counter picked out there coming out from my cancel this much more aggressive look from the jungle certainly all about the early game dentally speaking my question is is there enough gag assistant you're really kind of worth it to where is he going to actually be looking on the map I would immediately think you're trying to Target something like that big are who doesn't have a lot of Escape but that being said Corky has no gang you really have no gangs in any of your lane supposed to also we could just be being utilized to try to pull you around the drive and hope that your legs are able to push ensure and then looks kind of get it done it just means that way well so has pick chase after all of it I didn't see it coming with you me and lusion although I agenda is real luck quite safe but if maybe you find your way in the back side there by invading by attacking clabber by professional Lane through tracking this opposing dumler and enzymes you are able to just through the sheer power of His in early game you'll be able to pull off games given without apple game consists of one of the things that people really talk before he has a lot of CPR it is relatively affordable in all disabilities are skillshots he's he's pretty easy to actually Focus so it may be trying to play around that it and keep nisky down here if that's the case we'll see how successful Mike young a few weeks are going to be able to be tackle box at bottom from the bottom about need to shape up the Cloud 9 side your third-place finisher from last in position to keep fighting her first place and it's a battle that they are expected to win any Team Liquid bidding off the game so maybe that's fantastic things like could be there even with the silence band there are the Restless not hear back that's going to be a good one it's actually electrocute your as well from Phoenix so very aggressive room cuz we haven't seen a lot more Fleet on Coursey that certainly is the standard approach but could be doing a little bit of extra damage here early menopause brain fog will be nice there for Jaco and Mike young is going to be hail of blades so this is a room setup which will allow you to park your knock up incredibly fast that third hit on the Q does go off so so fast with hail of blades and that was no a lot of what kind of lead to the champion you're terrorizing so if you terrorizing the jungle and with these four level two games and it's super aggressive ramped-up play and I think if you are trying to Target Midland and hey maybe grabbing you liked you for some little bit more aggressive makes more sense with that game plan then just one sleep 10 gold given over on both sides here is the war is killed and technically a blabber didn't get the money cuz he walked out of sweeper range and so only sneaky got it it's the most minor thing ever but technically 10 gold lost either way it's still a nice word to kill it's extra money is Dickies pocket next to you as well which I don't believe actually matters into on two lanes, but doesn't want no one to know you're at Taco Bell and follow going to walk out tonight I think that's a nice little move right you know if you do expect that they are releasing their walk up it's pretty easy to get that one little hit off with you be a little bit of gold Proctor II Men flow very early on in and get the guardian out of the way as well as novelty W start your for Apollo so this is very heavily leading towards that's enough clothes style that we did you see it is sorcery as a secondary here from Lucien so no it is manaflow band on him as well know that's really kind of what they're looking for other style do to fall out of favor a little bit thank you tax changes were they different increase the cost that you believe lbw and try to push that thang up a lot of the damage output is not be as high but rank one of its fine and yeah that's right it in despite the fact the guardian is the traditional answer to Pocono that is very helpful it is not going to be up for all of the Poke obviously coming in and and they're looking to try to attack the manifold Azazel and asthma attack of the long cool nouns in there looking all right well the first attempt to your 80 Cloud Nine with flapper in the topside and still it was with the early prepper there's the issue Landon going to mail flow is going to not flash it make a damage to your flashes back to the docket and it's going to be so lows going down first just seems to have worked out so much better you notes perhaps just getting at least being that big of a difference but he is level 3 is level 2 and and wasn't even able to be up there at the same time so the leash expedium up quite a lot in this game is basically unavoidable once solo is this far up as soon as you actually gets Low by the Jays you're just dead cuz we're going to see your load there fiber is really just going to wait and Hold the Flag drag until after you flash and at that point there's no really scaping whatsoever humo does end up committing his own Flash not come back and they can't even more of a sure thing but a nice fruli play their next Flagger Force play it's going to look nice right now C9 definitely want to be very best games in North America cultivating Talent find the right post Academy team if you're going to look pretty good on stage and another potential win column here for a blabber and Kumo as they sit on a pretty standard bottom laying here playing back black book with the candies and guarding the blocks of the damage and just think slightly down in Pharmacy what you expect to lose Lane slightly when your solution you mean it's just a graceful don't by the bank and trust laying down here forever but. Glass reveals and fog of war and tags in the face I can probably could have just flash on and then killed in there because he has no flash but you don't know that blabber isn't around right you know that is just a big? There so no blabber now knowing that that my king is one of them into the go ahead and take away those Rafters and certainly is going to be off to a very very good start and when you are playing at Jiffy like she's out who you really do need to get these are really feels to be getting an advantage because this is not what I would consider to be a strong Champion you know from even or behind know but so far he ain't got to say this is a been actually pretty close gay in the ultimate Farm difference is in the Rebecca Fox until it has like to get curlier on as we walk despite play out it's not great for the Gangplank be like the farm numbers and he's doing fine now you get the extra money because he's games like a horse that she was pretty little bit more extra is well and end of the day it's a tide game build wise and the fact that they kill went to the jungler and now you're posing top laner is always going to make you feel really good because at the end of the day what is Kubo get over the first assist and he used his flash has his flash school but you would probably Trace is 50 cold to have your Summoner back up and feel comfortable yet situation so I got 25 but still I would still make that she really is on bladder but we'll see you know if solo can get any sort of an edge from that and it might Young Who I think he is going to look to just go for a straight-up Lane gang runs great up there flash on the JC has no flash available so I went the heliblade you should be able to pull something off but well he's like a drink is on cooldown though when he shows an award instant before that thing decays down today make sure it's safe make you unable to be really part of this fight at all of the Jays but there's no way you're going to survive now that they are has actually arrived so then the play going the way up. Side and Phoenix you're not really going to get any sort of an advantage in the mid lane as a result of his either maybe it's a couple CF but you're a Viber shows up he is up a level so low just has no Mana so it's like the fact that he does actually blacked out Dodge is that flag and drag is going to get knocked down anyway it was such a good place for the Canik is a Kenwood level six that you didn't kill it so you can get the partial Manor refund on killing it with Q enough Mana to use the ultimate I know that feeling it sucks play where you lived it really was so tight so I can't really imagine for that it was really fall margins button cover blubber and small margins there but you know perhaps you could have allowed in that to be to have a chance at turning around and getting a kill on Jace either way things are looking good for Cloud 9 up all night Ops III but solo holding its own and in the farm at least until a force to walk back do taking a lot of damage now is this time to kill did to come through in the Flames licking the last unless close quick look at the bottom line is for the farm weed for phone Jaco do you want to point out there up 18 minutes that's really solid some white high so I want to give him props for that by letting their 7 minutes Rockwell yeah you know by comparison he has he has basically double the goals that diesel has earned at this point so very far
