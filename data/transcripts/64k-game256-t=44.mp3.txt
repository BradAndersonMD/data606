is IG simply playing with that food or does IG look sloppy joe sides when you look at was last year they dropped two games The Fanatic and then they made the run all the way to the world files looking extremely convincing so few always have to be afraid of what's the left in the IG text me the scariest thing about yesterday's game their 16-minute victory over SK Telecom wasn't even how quick it was it was at the stars of that game where the jungler and the bottom lamp that is not what people used to praising about Invictus gaming winners the absolute Peak players the Cheyenne rookies gods of their positions but it was Ming and Jackie love on display with some very interesting pics with a Camille and Draven coming out so I'm always very excited to see what this team will draft absolute they are incredibly impressive of the Bands almost done here we can talk a little bit about Flash those here of course it's his the big story is the rebuilding year when to two star players went overLPL this year and it's okay what can Flash rules do as an organ that never miss the semifinals of MSI right now they are on the outside looking at they do need to play a bit better IG will be a great starting point would be phenomenal would be great we have to remember this class was had a fantastic game yesterday when they played up against me to open the game going in favour of The Flash also feels like this they are gradually ramping up throughout the twin of my things ravva is getting better and better and now we look at the draft things like the ride and the akali are we going to take the akaliyeah with a stylus band out here no surprise idea me delete will take the leftover arrive for themselves such a potent power pick for the squad definitely threatening a top or mid and they also get for the premier support galio in the bottom side with Tom kench already banned off the table provides so much playmaking I would also really love to see an odorless come out from the side of plants will we see multiple teams pick it up as an answer and the it goes through the food away and you couldn't end up in a situation likenow bro I'm locked in here certainly, Gretchen's and mail it got near the BOK close by as he Kelly Hansen gel paired up together and that's still a hug right now on this guy said it was going to pick us even want to do with your last pic and that's not locked in I mean again is Gentile I personally am just not on the bandwagon here for their sin Sal big especially into something like a Leo does make it kind of hard for a champion wins since I was basically has One Direction going in with the team v a gallon is a really good answer. If he can make use of the pros of this Champion since out still in the early game can go for the aggressive looks we'll see if they can make it worth their Kingdom on your parents with the Frog pick up that does give you possibilities on the bottom side I'm really excited to see Jack Halifax on a stable champion this determined that I don't think so far ahead yet a lot of forests and I believe he played a bit16 minutes from the I walked in right away to make sure they have their top cleaner for an early aggressive disc me to Jesse Tate or expecting the akali to go into the Top Lane or whatever the flash will decide to play in the kennel because they had the ability to save that right now they just saving a jungle picture that final thing but they did or didn't know that a person of these most play top when is akali and there aren't any across the year for rather he is a mage player through-and-through Vladimir lesandro down if he's kind of fixed so that walked in there and now they need just a final bottling march to pick or Peter bodley made them relief and I think that Comfort is really important to focus on that Oriana you talk about him just picking upwhat is the champion that rather created the big play vs Z2 to give them opening in that game flashing in on first try to punish birds for is over aggression opened up a possibility or Flash wolves will be able to take that game and that would be as a lock in there also going to have that flexibility on the bus. And I can't get this evening is Cain plays the rosicrucian apportioning no Shadow as fast as he comes out from him a bit more alluring and if you look at the enemy team they are all quite squishy they wanted to make sure that it was make the most sense to women in the game pain can be punished especially the Champion Lakes in jail now it's specially it will get at determining answer if you're playing with your food what are the indicators could be a catalystbaby I should decide to go floof are there plenty of rain Champion that you get inside your point of gallium comes on top and you like alright I'm ready to come out as soon as it's done and then you go for the fight the reason for having up by the way if you have a look at the patch notes recently the shadow assassin cooldown was taken out to eight seconds went to transform a strong so if your toe Invictus gaming looking by far the best team in the world the best need to make it into the top four on the outside looking in Invictus gaming are 44 this oneand we are on to summoner's Rift Invictus gaming looking at a 5-0 start Robbins there has not been undefeated group-stage team IG on the road for that onebut is there more CC Auto attacks started to flash a way it is going to complete unless your enemy flashes into fog of War so that it's all about the timing there and they got both the kill and the Flash out of the Thai thing here to be said Friday is that it was two classes for one but that is very little to say for yourselves after first blood but given over to be afraid of a level 2 came early on I think I want the akali get fat trout it's going to be very difficult to gang so I think the fact that we can start with a long sword early on definitely a great through the game Advantage if I can set flash. For Success my favorite part of that is that the shiz rushes over their head long he's right into the bush that he doesn't even have that option to try and get out or Flash wolves on the board here versus the defending world championI'm a little bit sad to say but the first indicator for me that name will be his ways and will happen if you're going poop one then you want a birthday images funny like electrocute the reason why it's so much better for pro play obviously the CC and taking it with you mighty zip code for the Tesla car to make that aggressive move with no vision on the end of my love it though because it encapsulate the idea that this team is always looking for the kill they said they're not afraid to go for the also not afraid to die for themare you guys ever look at the bright side of the shiz plays I like we believe in doing things well very gray be happy to go to advance and visit and while they are very small it's nice to see Robert having his pressure up against rookie I feel like you're probably the only person bringing out the Ariana in this one degree. You know he's already performed really well on it only thing is really going to have to worry about is the Yule passerby gang from Pain rise and set up games very well you have to worry about the room prisonso they're going to want some Vision around him to help him out back topside has been the name of the game who you found the money up there early on Flipping to return and see if the guy goes aggressive once again I don't have his Play the song using is he a fair bit for harassment and getting something cool down back down again a lot of this stew is just waiting for I think they know that they don't want to let this guy get behind like that and there's a possibility that nothing would make an appearance and you can definitely turn that to be too heavily in your favor even when no flashes and you can read as well as Delaney's family pushing back now it's crashing of the turd it should be going backwards Apostles side until there's the ward there's nothing waiting around at the shop I get to on TuneIn the question is how is it going to go to eat Fortunes in a to find the sun now and again it is no flash on either on every with anyone but nothing but looks like it's actually possible for Subway on this one and it could damage has the red striped pajamasnow it's a force against winning the Top Lane fight that again you can see the moment where they decide we could win this do we do that. I just use the Shroud ecologist use let's go for it but they're going price in South I wasn't on the bandwagon to check select so this point initialize the exchange with his foot so we can meet at Lee come down if I had a very very squishy you can look at the crap at least that's how I get and shut him down. As long sword at work that was busy getting the recall off during the first blood in the lungs before we are in his first gamedo on the 4th at rookies getting down to the Five On The Rise how far is getting pretty low shall see you can barely see that's the one throwing a bottom Lane now they're going to push them anyway might as well flag poles sticking around I think with the help are here on you should be able to stick around for a Betty they don't have to worry about another possible dive and it's just a successful romare from Rookie to answer one of the kids foot again making early move this is one of the players for flagpoles at two are looking for a proven he's out to see if he is a good dayfollow kill able to get that kill ping level six and use the ultimate for the victory in that by the shop keeps taking those swings we're not done islands near Mid I want points you guys stop looking at the bright side outdoor Splash was again finding the 140 looking at the bright side it's making it funny and loving that day off Waze app salute standing right now winning every single one of these skirmishes they are on fire now you can understand why the show I went to that place was level 6 level advantage over Hannah Baker and his crew the Shroud just didn't quite have enough damage turns on the mail a minion music you able to get it most every week then in midlane here Pookie goes in on the rookie if it is not the first image under Tower flashes out just in time and even know nothing about was the last they have a Teleport for good measure defending their teammates and I love to use of the exhaust I think it came out from ratha with the unsealed Spellbook mitigated the potential finding to dive onto and then make it a one-for-one but now I don't want to answer back they want to help out that talk later they have two members roaming up topside 1700 gold-bears it's about what you pay for with those four kills coming in the way they are that is that kind of straight here we go again does have no shroud have to play this out there ZR2 eat backwards. The way is 0 damaged else and clean you got a couple of Kain Soul right there that's about it I think we left now picked up and Rogers going to feel good about this one if he's got the small CS Lee. It's like it's too obvious it wasn't funny but at least it was said my motto I think it's it wasn't funny to least I said it every day. So you can see the pain is coming out they want to set up a dive and thing is that you making his weight away from the topside jungle to this the perfect opportunity. Side-by-side out play
