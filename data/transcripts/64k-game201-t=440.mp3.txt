I think fun plus talk about them in the play crazy stuff for the end of the day they still have really good team fighting game they got lwx I've got game to call the shotgun mlpl because he is not afraid to dive in the back of the spike and absolute takeover team by team won the most aggressive late game team Fighters I think you are going to see at this tournament and the fun places in incredibly frightening team do their snowball 15 when they get any sort of like licking humans over on this feels like one personnavigate to 20841 Kiva world right now for things like that and I think that it is a shame that people are going to quickly fall in love with despite if you haven't seen them because he's every role we going to be throwing at you know unique characteristics and I think the last thing I want to mention gets how well they dive tour it's early this is a team to level four. I think the event it right it's because they give you no time there's no hesitation they're going to be for men flashing on you in immediately killing someone off before you can actually turn around to play but on the other side certainly both of looking toget things done here for jtm he is the standout player and don't be while he is an incredible mid laner he's he's last known for his laning and that is where if you are dating I think you were really hoping they can start to get some advantages off the plate first of all like these Deport pick us where as well as they take out the carries himself aggressive pod spitting up in TN credible incredible jungle is he was going to grab split squat shopping bottom line we already talked about the fact that he's one of the best way for the pairing however Timberland field as wellTerry Reid on kind of the matter on how they want to execute around it has been used only a problem for the Raging in the pot, but I don't think your team sucks as much from that concrete to take acrylic Clear Choice cannabis garden locked in these I hear as well so Jason have a pretty standard body composition BlackRock control good engaged to Kerry play the swap from 80 Terrace is very young and he's kind of an emotional by I've been just drive to and from all the people that if you get behind if you thought the struggle in the elegant can get lost on summoner's Rift does need somebody to get from my phone will gravitate around at midlane and I feel like that's kind of against the grain of how they saying they need to be able to give me Hannah the best pics of a 10 for him right now does place was that style it certainly does the TN on the other side you know he's going to be having this to lease an early-game Powerhouse certainly one of those topics here fixed someone who can do to facilitate the odds of that likes to do but certainly deserve their do they were one of those dominant teams we have seen you coming to the elements in a very long time absolute Crush summer split the whole entire game just because it is such a long split did you guys still play best of braids are there is multiple David to be able to create that outfit but most likely ETA when they ask you to the LMS Stephanie Curry is going to be with us for the LMS I think the last 13 months have been really really disappointing is dying it's locked in for the minutes before I made a bad choice and a side of mashed showing at last four Championship JT trying to lead the charge you to say no LMS we are still good will be they can make that happen here is locked through I think they're pretty good I think it's certainly possible you've heard from dovey you know they could be going up the game again certainly igp band out that is his most played you're doing be most played for him he's actually the rides they certainly targeting the soul enter there was j-team I don't be kind of known for some of the Innovative rise builds no kind of pioneering things like this and righteous Glory rise and sing the rylai's as well trying to play in The Silence can be one of the best in the entire tournament is not the best week I talk later in the tournament so certainly would not be shocked to see him put on that Scion if they want to save some sort of immortal InFocus pick here for don't be in the midline is still one of those ratings it has boots black of hot carry top laners and then wait till I tell planets and I do agree with you you have a look at people while I wash laundry and I think I know he is certainly play this quite a bit in the LPL so that would make it very likely no amidst ionic is fossil is a science report galio mid hilarious and black thing that could come out here but I am expecting is mortiser to go top here working goon willing to call a different back to textures will be Fofo could do lots of karaoke Los I'm supposed to be 20 seconds left still think about they want to there's Maybe This Island gallio swapping but it's an LPL special honestly and so much damage is going to come out of l w x and his I thought you know I already feel like we are going to be seeing those four or five been following plays a likely seeing him good play weak side of the map going to be pushing out and grouping up with them looking for man plays out of the word that bottom side we're going have to see our little B and koala able to withstand that amount of fracturing are Hannah and Fofo going to be able to match those were actually allow it so it level six she is under threat a little bit more because I specifically very often in desire has an order with white Nike but I have the feeling like you know we keep building up the walls it'll be really embarrassing if I go to topple game now welcome back to summoner's Rift Funplex Phoenix if it's your first time seeing them buckle up it's going to be a pretty quick ride potentially what are the very strongest teams in the world they lost a single match this split across the LPL they won regular-season in Spring they want regular season in summer they finally won the tournament in summer here as well incredible incredible Squad incredible players there are a great team and LTL has been waiting to join be to be on the international stage for such a long time will also take you through the fact that JT is the similar situation 12 throughout regular-season smashing through those up playoffs as well 31 pearces HQ in the final Bitcoin be played with Swift and then finally found his way to FBI and it's always been going to be throughout the regular season of fantastic performances this guy is fluent in Mandarin he's a fan favorite and he's always stumbled to make it to these games National event well that will change this split pairing with TN this year was just such a great move because he had depression is finally dead and we finally have a similarity you to be able to play around which I don't think we've had definitely agree you know they have been working credibly well together either Synergy it is very impressive to see and it's it's also I think that is working very well for then you can see don't be actually going for that spell book is something he often does on Nautilus as well and looking for a swap over for things like you tonight for more kill pressure when he is looking for those to be too sore move down toward the bottom side and they also want to talk about a little bit is this more to Kaiser vs. Gnar matchup in in the early levels it can be quite difficult for the mordekaiser but posted there certainly is the potential to actually look for solo kills because women are is actually on know that kind of exhausted state where you cannot get into Mega and you Altimas mordekaiser he's a locked in with you in with those lower base stats without the ability to necessarily Caillou around as well it certainly looked really punish that dive champions in the game we just makes every scenario 1 B-1 right so if we think he's going to play out in the fashion that we seen so many FPS games play out during the regular season begin ability to cross that trade against them it's so crucial where to watch but certainly fun plus I feel like it's the likely formula is pushing the middle and going down to the bottom when getting your shotgun is loaded and getting him a couple of shells to plasti folding squat he was going to fight in the bottom Lane right there though and how each one of them is towards crisp really nice little trade their from JT and I was like the timing of when they backed off you know if they are to stay in too long is it up it'll do exit able to talk of passive it there then the tree can really even out also a good quick trade from JT man that is going to help them have priority on this bottom side Scuttle on a knows he has really move from is battling if there were to be any sort of Challenge from an area where Hannah is showing kind of the fact that he wants to be able support of the side of the map that we think is going to come under Fire there's no point being able to go to world's top Lane if you think that immediately the trade is going to be down bottom to the additional resources in God I've already spoken about this but as a jungler so far behind on experience and levels I think that this first part is being able to assure Ralph what should be now a level 6 on Gavin and the ability to impact a map if you run into a lease early game especially when she has Redbox she can be such a pain to deal with being able to navigate that successfully and there's always going to want things we like to talk about his kind of the pressure on a lease to make of the game plays Eliza Champion that he want to be proactive with that you want to be making things happen in those early levels and not necessarily dedicating as much time as some other jump close to farming where is Jarvis is going to be completely happy you're going a full tank Ralph Tiana just able to actually stop the recall they're really annoying because don't they use his helper to get back to Lane mobile has no teleport so that is actually going to cost him some gold and especially if they want to be did elective to allow some of the minions to get tonight and he is going to be able to push that in tonight tonight strings poplin it's a no a Collies Walking Tall made that dive happen before Hannah arrived there's no chance for rest of you'll actually fight back going across before he's even in any immediate danger but it isn't no hesitation that just pulled the trigger placed out there's going to be that kind of really good way of control from Cancun to bet that protects these wave on the balance and is able to set up that dive I want to go to Richard plus the extra csu's got that have already 600 gold lead to fun Plus Phoenix is the first be recalled come through the bottom Lane as well and nothing too surprising me decide it's not like it's trying to farm is not from the same success that do you know what he has to be really interesting to see where don't be actually doesn't like to go with us build if it is snowing like it's Derek's rush if we had kind of scene from solo queue in the past has made Saiyans know I wouldn't be too shocked and awed quite a bit of early game dammit and tankiness certainly not as much in the later stages of something if you work to rush liquor randuin's or whatever but can be very very powerful the entire point of the Scion kit is the extra help you gain with your W-4 the passive its own estate sales off of double scales yeah one of the things he's able to do with them as well if you really don't need the LT just a couple of mechanics built into another wife but otherwise fun Champion for the Scion Demolisher what else you got around to it and make a big hammer
