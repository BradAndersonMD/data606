they ran into a bunch of frogs around their overall cultural practice and and put their putting on the stage of these teams here trying to change things around going into the summer split will see which one of them damn rather finds more of a diving a champion slides take it away thank you very much. We are here for the third game of the day once again it's the only thing they get their start a wind here in a good tune-up game I feel like both these were Squad that did Miss playoffs in the spring split they both switched out of players in this is now the combination that will win the game on my side of things are both good choice for the team's I think I have high hopes for both these flies yeah they talked about a lot on the battle of the changes that need to make changes to make paint yeah after last wet and they both did so in addition to the new players amazing and ruin on both team I also considering a wiggly fairly fresh on to the lineupare y'all coming from their Academy roster as well as silly go and I both those guys already played on the starting roster but have still look like they need time to work with the rest of the team and really melt can do a lot of Stella Lane bands of we're seeing the irelia collie Silas and Rise all taken up the healing monster anymore we will see this special kind of stupid smirk on file Frost Fate Zero ending face if you don't have to pop off to much I do like the fact that all that you do have to get off of your mark been some time to get your auto attack so you can get your shield and your bed is a very dramatic get your killed off and getting to know that cool down as it changes over your level by the way is definitely one of the finer points that's who you me and we'll see how well that is used in trades we've also Isaiah was talking about but jumping off the clock is still shot and then jumping back on so you do have some health you can use to know scrimmages you don't have to just rely on your mark then you give me at hello Mr armor in Farmers fine or else only slightly downspout thanks for supporting is a male a chance of hopping onto Champs Lakes Edge Ronnie and end in Frontline with them and this but I have never and will a lot of people are focused on the uni Ezreal Poe combination silver with the boomerang played in the Ricochet takes out the wave and you be able to poke them it's so incredibly annoying go see if there are you get some Vision you get them control around that bottom line we can be very very impressive I did went on the TL side now it's banging app removes turn to pick that one up definitely a few of them on paper should be incredible that because I've had a pretty lackluster spring split but I'd still believe in a pedigree of those two players on at these a squad that the top three teams in the end of the year and it wasn't quite there but we'll see what Santa looks like for the second round table yeah I mean that the team that because go to the star power that you look at when you look at the roster very high expectations amazing coming off some time in Europe so time are the Jets coaching jumped around a little bit not quite sure where he's going to land as far as being back on the actual Elka stage but Garvin definitely a jongleur right now that has a lot of option where the few that can still go for the early King free Scuttle crab you can still just go Red Bluff level two and try and get that really pressure off on one of your soul ain't that special we can be effective so if they have any early targets here for him to go after to try and snowball ahead typically though we've seen some day be the focus of early and bang be the focus late Sunday is definitely done quite well in his Lanes go see what he can get after these ban yeah they want to play a Ouija Nico has been about Champions. Clear through trades as well as somebody definitely well versed on the champion but it's also flexible so so they could take her up very standard Warwick cover for 6 a.m. favorite Champion that one pretty much for power of evil he was or not who knows he's going to roll the dice pick whatever he wants and now we got to figure out what is apoplectic going to be could go to mid lane instead they got to kind of keep track of both those matchups pain the very safe blind and that seems very likely for us here if you're is a d can be booked in ya Canon can just focus on him and he can stay out of the flame spitter rain should be able to use the exit visas to try to avoid harpoons as well and also bring and equally effective APA ultimate to those team fight if you look at the squad that coz of drafted here it says wani Frontline very standard here with strong support backline threat for later in the game so very clear John Cena fighting are for the tlg side the combo with a hot pot Rumble Jarvan ultimate on top of each other is here is that I have for later so definitely have a more possibility similar to set up right then I do like the lake antifa hear 100 things but of course they were scaling scaling very good as well there's no I feel like an obvious but lots of really strong points of power across the border to be a lot of fighting to be pretty fun here as we wait to see them anymore swaps where they are and they are these are the ones for sure final remarks from the coaching staff and we get to see the very beginning glimpses of worth changes the right ones were they enough to turn the face around coz famously last year missed playoff Miss what is well a bit surprising but it did happen open the now the new top later no longer with dark trying to be enough hundreds he's hoping that a switch in Jungle rain amazing back last in North America spies years ago on TSM the world's top eight then back in and out open to bring hundred thieves somewhere good super excited for the bottom Lane specifically as well so busy I work on into the uni Lane how it is going to be annoying for those all in the idea attack them maybe they combine it with some jungle attention maybe early game at will tell things already coming down though we might have some Ventures out for a possible invade group that steel G looks like they're going straight made with everybody that's got to be a look at it in bed spot them and no yes map where can I go inside the state and look for something but there's a chance I can get Sera. He's not a very safe location right now definitely can jump over the wall they could have actually made their way all the way into this jungle during that what they have not I like that we also got to lie in anticipation similar to 100 thieves experience their very authentic definitely approve and now they're rewinding a little bit here invades for the Deep Ward but actually a c is it just the one sweeper start both sides with the sweepers starving as well and with the zombie Ward to get a little bit of protection all right nothing too dangerous here I do always really appreciate Superstars level one I think it makes for very interesting mind games and great possibilities here and especially for jungler lunch break you can do is actually start with the trinket Ward's go out and place it then recall before minions spawn grab up your sweeper so that after your clear when you're going for your first game also be able to use a sleeper to ensure that they don't have vision of you first get the value of that trinkets to clean a used for at least four solo queue as fast as ready so it's damaged, it's also because you can't support with her little help in the damage based Championship cut down is actually very very strong at his presence of mind not manaflow band cuz of course it couldn't be but it's a lot of mana and a lot of damage that is the point of that champion always want to stay attached to your 80 Carrie wants to go off and get that passive Auto attack jumping on with the shield is able to get a good trade there with sticks a what level do you Max right afterwards you look pretty good for this when I connect rating of Southeast damage which is also very effective here as you mentioned in champ select with the silver images early odd they get control the Wave Bar prices going for auto attack trade-in to the q's grade as well while sick stay focused mostly mostly on the minions exhaust for 85 Volvo to be less aggressive version where that could help feeling to the server is the forest EP on service was you going to be really focused on staying up in the lane keeping the farm going in now. We're looking for some jungle action early Recon can go for the all-in engaged soon as amazing just wrapped around it is a push-up ways they are very far far will aphromoo move and there's a spot of another way drive from Newton ice flash gets away from a thing or not to summon spell down there worthwhile game simply time of isn't being also didn't have to lose too much dies at the turret that's one of the drawbacks sometimes of skanking the soup push the plane if you fully commit for it then you're a d ends up losing CVS in exchange but in this case it's just amazing going in gets a very valuable Flash the only one of the lane off of 6/8 and already you can see the change in how you have to play the way in there's no flash you also have no vision this early on in the game so they're going to have to respect we looked out the mid lane right here is power real battles with his opposing member insulae go now in the top laners ruin with the Quasi counterpick there's an expectation that. Not a guarantee and puts in the Canon gets the scepter Nancy is doing pretty okay up there but for evil inform this is a rebel who's been able to form so far all right breast recall for amazing is going to find him on top side since did the red clear here. I'll just might has been picked up. So there was a little bit of counter jungling as we would be able to get one extra camp that means that we have more to farm under threat they should not be till they already knew that they saw Jarvan top at 6 is going to get Savannah back here to off the level up maybe you can clear out this way is bank so much damage to this current they get a plate by themselves very good for the hundred piece you out tonight and finding us active root on his dick say just pulled back as well for 6 I can still bring his own teleport do you know this from earlier and right back in actual money doesn't put them out enough for a pickaxe so he'll be reasonable here I suppose U controller comes in and won't miss more than I think maybe two minutes yeah definitely good for the hundred thieves Duo to be push up so they can walk back during the timing window of the teleport usually or teleport can really do you think that and give the extra advantage over to the server side fairly quickly and are already walking back so should be able to make it down there pretty quickly better recall her bag as well for us 10 more City Art by having Warhammer instead. Such a pretty solid you be a course in the sheet back in by just using you and me and me a piggyback in the teleport very curious to see again if we have repeated ganks from amazing on the bottom side it's very effective Blast Burn as you could already see the instant results were how you have to play the lane you know silver hassa play more cautiously biofrost cannot harass as much because you need definitely very horrible winner it he carried it in a Flash however they also call Wiggly defensive Vision that we seen just now placed in the mini-map by CLG is a very good answer all these three trying to defend against the dryer vent on your map. be able to see the driving force amazing back into his own territory which flag and dragged away has been heard in the lungs in the river is done goal so that's going to be just fine is there a spot around nice people is about to go to space out. Look on the fly fly away from an open wound come in just yet I'm amazing just assumed that it said Ronnie is gone since he saw him exit into the Russian has left with weekly stays around with eyes on the Friday to find a gauge are the jarvinen CLG first flood on the top part of the map this is also opening up bottom side since they know that the jugglers. Yeah you got no vision of power of evil orianna gets the bird
