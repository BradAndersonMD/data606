Clean closing out so I think it's pretty safe place for the bottom dispatch who picked up your perfect iced tea have had a decent amount of long game so far in spring so it's reasonable to assume that but if they do walk in the callista thank youyou a lot of bottom line control it also gives you Five Below in front of snowball early dragons and I do like the champion in the meadow right now because of those factors as well they can create so many plays probably something like from here to get a lot of different offensive and defensive options in there as well right now and wait for his pic though is xayah and rakan a pretty expected to come through here against have fangs cosplay of Zaya at all stars definitely impressive as well as his place so happy to be on it once again combined with rakaan just looking to have that explode two-factor you can actually do decently well into callista Lane Surly in a few things first desire game and Sons 1st Rec on game of the split toe putting it through this practice me know how to not make playoffsmiss the postseason here as we're playing for practicing and in shaping up and has not okay for LCS team so to do well and if you're looking at Chesapeake Synergy has diarrhea con combo for the bottom line here subbing son tinh Phu all of the academy players by the way I've been very very positive about at start just when the more senior guys do on that line up and he's got a lot of far as coaching the strategy for the team and keep it immoral up happy I need him back on the LCS stage 76% compensation highest on the beam across the academy has been a good contributor and we'll see if we can do that if it's 6 a.m. biofrost after when I get to play against his old team here if he's been stepped out of 4th 4th Corner taken off the table as well as and we've got a flex pick a collie but both fall into the light Shone it was a syndrome ID for peelingalright skarner either I'm very excited to see what we go for in the jungle with progress and as you mentioned he actually hit rank 1 in the North American solo queue ladder and a lot of the games were ivern so I've been holding out for it give me the winky face but he's going to try and we've got of course he doesn't every game and we'll see what he actually wants to play pretty soon but they do need a top winner and a jungler or foot the bill at 2:20 to pick you doing if they want to make sure that it is going to be the akali 100% in the top ways before darshan submit to his fixed so it got to go juggler Fortier again another non-committal me to text Juanita and after shark tank for you had to possibility for initiation for Wiggly they already have a Kalisto with a bra attached to it so she'll be out looking like again very standard King by fosta Billare there five five looks very strong and two tanks and they are going to be ice cold in that front line and it got plenty millyard Garvin locked-in that's going to go most likely differ I guess you're so we haven't even talked Jarvan and indeed it has been played before but the last pic needed Now where's it going to go and Callie are going to be going into the middle enforcer you go and they have a lot of Pi progression to make a lot of space does the color to pop off another AP galio game picked up here so Elaine and I do like the combination jarvinen galio one of the classics bread and butter you jump in get a cataclysm down keep people around for the galley ultimate to arrive for the poppy very good use of the setbacks presence is possible here so many Champion a specifically against the ones who won with a Collie kids dapaah you smell as well if youbut at the right time here you want to get one of the high-value -

Delay biofrost little trays in mechanics are for the bottom lamp plays trying to threaten when you do have a lot of this potential again this is early game though and as you can see on the map the junglers have been denying a lot of information practices is flipped up here into the crowds done some counter jungling for himself before even going through his blue quadrant this is going to mean that weekly as a lot fewer options and often times when you're in this situation as progress you set your soul fuck you get a small eat in The Jungle by having extra can of clear but you need to keep your lanes notified because this is going to push Wiggly into a situation where he has no camps to go forth and he is forced to go for a possible Lane play the only way he gets back in and catches up is if your Lantern allow him to get that lane playoff go for a gank or you know moving out for the vision I don't have to make up some of the Mist Farm but again there is a reset and the the pack back through the struggles to make that happen so they both got their rights might they both got the control board so far life seems fine for multiplayers but I left her with me to farm here at the bottom Lane is decently volatile so both of them will probably have their eyes on bottom side vision control and progress is set up to do a kind of a reverse clear back to the bottom side if you start a crop wolves then Raptors will be the case weekly is going to try to cut him off at the past year though goes for the counter and they will be able to find himself the rapper can't even if a cup so he's not going to be behind at all and it's actually going to pull ahead here of projects because of the extra time at broad walk across the math weekly going did as well be found here just in case you're as stubborn as down four hundred thieves yeah progress there quick on the trigger finger with the flash there's weren't really in a situation where you're going to get a counter kill and at best I think he's trying to dissuade theology from going any further Anza League oh yeah but that you might want that flash back afterwards and it's a tough call I'm not sure to get it on Meme on the pots ideas for me through the shields up for file for lost and unsure if I could have knocked up cats legal alive or he's going to go away anyway I think at the very least you spend at the little extra time of walk that distance actually does go for the knock up a it was a good in a rep from Bob Ross this delay them but he stopped again doesn't go to it didn't have been in a Cuban NW back out so if you could let the recall but it's going to be that ignites are in play on the bottom side so a lot of attention will be paid here early on we can get all endings from either side the drug dealers are going to be the biggest resource that they fight over Frog the game actually passed over that Ward through the Raptors really should know it's a possibility he's here and see each other for the shield on so nothing of the game they're one of my favorite parts of sidhwani you know you can also pop the honey fruit walk over them with you or hit with the slows while you have your Frost armor on party what is level 60 or so stingy a level 6 definitely something there. Which could also play about this bottom triangle of the map very important and that's why we can see after the fur recall on your mini-map right now from file fraud is moving in trying to clear out the transmission pathway hear from mid and bottom as both of them are very good opportunities for CLT to capitalize in a sealed you have great Vision Center on the bottom side of the river so no big can be found in progress and it lets you eat keep pushing you to see little by little farm denied + 21 CFM inline up after sleep until 4 to get back to Ling's who actually abusive and he's actually been crushing this one-on-one so far with a bit of help from the team a Sony decide we're going to go because he'll be back but will not be sun but it's writer who started Mountain Drake and Lexington Estates of this one as long as you can push this one is topside and where the things I know this was practice quite often in the Academy games recently he got a lot of the objectives but it was from Smite dealing or trying to go for solo see her without vision from the enemy team he is going to be able to get this first match in trade for the team and just give you a decent amount of experience in addition to the extra cold now that it offers so very worthwhile pick up even though Mountain Drake's Barrett Ileana can't use to get more first place if you have a couple of seconds that mean the difference maybe you do recall timing and be a big thing if it gets based off a true damage from Moundridge just come in before
