or if flyquest pulls up this upset it would be one of the biggest Shockers NLCS history becoming the fifth over organization to actually went to final so it's going to be really freaking I can't wait it's going to be absolutely exciting bestify We Are the Champions like tea or forced out that was a high speed going to choose blue side here and I am very curious looks like because as you mentioned cloud has been just the most dominant scheme and everything should tell you that cloud 9 are going to be heads and sold about the competition and yet seems Blacklist to get better with the roster swaps easy as well as Cloud 9 to the president can't let go of the fact that maybes wife West has closed the Gap Band on the right day figure take the series as we get in this hoe got five but I'm curious what kind of competition takes shape here yeah I think I've walked enough sports to know that even when there's an overwhelming favorite nothing is certain so always waiting to see what the actual results are just yesterday Quest on red side in 3 drafts in a row against niji currently hovering and also either LeBlanc and the power picture was getting taken orally on to distract Affiliates instead in order traded right away black with leaving at 3 pick available for something else that can be very aggressive ice in both expect that to win against of dahlias place with ever and so I'm here to fly first Rush pick a good defensive support that can keep a wild turtle safe for us to go somewhere else without the chance that a band as well but Bob and have walk-ins their first three as well which is our cue and in terms of what's been banned in the second phase right now off being taken out because it does look to me like flyquest is signaling Papillon jungle even though you know that that can be for the support I wonder, considering here whether or not they wanted to ban away the kind of Guardian style supports like the Brom or maybe even the thresh things that could have kept afelio safe I think having both bands on that attack you want to deny that access points for flights west end up instead decided to focus their band more towards our people died during the pre-show that the mid jungle for both of these themes is the strong point so even if there is potential draft vulnerability to attack on the mid lane Champions with long can cats go away write the first good thing to be very volatile you got Pantheon who is to say soup cream jungler right now it's like two more Jungle Band their second-half the edge in that match ups at how to pick in the mid lane I didn't go to the store at this point who has the better record good ol boys come into his computer or maybe we should a drain stinks up very well with his ears Soldier rain so it can make them hear a little bit more vulnerable I think overall do a year has been trending upwards in priority and it is a little surprising that we saw a captain in band before we saw in his ear band which makes me completely okay with black buttons not waiting for an azir counter picks we stop over in the LEC finals a Xerox turn it all the way into first pick by the end of that Series so really high priority lately on these here how do I get to Seymour Ferrari on marketing junglers here as well we saw TG play a bunch of votes during their unfortunate lost Aflac what's Bob and picking right up with been staring left off it's like yeah so far in the playoffs it has been very successful Zaxby's blitzcrank games including playoffs self more so like bookhunter for Kindred before for Veigar like in the mid game specifically is pulling people out of the Kindred ultimate there's a lot of displaced overall team competition show even though it has been a great Kindred this is a tricky game to navigate for Cottondale there's several good character for blood circulation the Kindred. See if you're a very good prank kills Shields and set it out argue primary tanks that is in Poppy's W and getting about half is Max Health yet to have excelled in a big Shield which you one shot deal damage after work instead of that set can be killed Nautilus X to my shielding as well so is actually quite a lot of value here that ignore can easily put forth in this game is going to be very exciting to Watch What Happens here I like the flag Quest draft Huey is on I think the epitome of teen site Mages and should be able to put up a bit upset that are 1000 damage permit at game like he's done several times before in the postseason and we're ready to go through this one has to be really exciting and passing Edition here for the finals as we got the player cams showing their remote setup so even more minute king of counsel I view environment but yeah freaky the early game here is go be really interesting because I want to know what's in Torrington activate here in the early game something that's been most impressive to me in the playoffs on blabber is actually some of his Nocturne early game pass because he's been able to pick jungler true or disadvantage in the early game but true where he passed get gold and experience advantages the other Junger take over self Papillon it's just such a monster from kind of level 3 on words in terms of early gang pressure let's pay attention to the early Wards and really where blabbering Central and go okay going to be watching the jungle pathing special the first 3 minutes or so in this game is so far it's the docile start you got for a little fence of words in each side ignore pick up where you left off really yesterday's games where he tried to pressure bit level ones you can get it okay to put the board down by the tracks in the bladder will see the pantheon going to start when is he Kindred get their flu to start a fairly similar opening that I really want to point out that a lot of time panteon can and take the other popular Pantheon path is actually the wolves and then into the Red Sox's jungle Central and has just done a red butt start so it will throw a few things off in terms of what slaver might be expecting also really pay attention to where Central and goes at 3 minutes I think he's probably the most frequent 3 minutes ganker of all LCS players soap generally that geckos Midwood house defensive miscues playing probably not till he's been involved need to be ready around 3 minutes to see if Santora's going that way because that's kind of where his path is taking him read if you look at how the mid lane is going right now keep why it was hard shove by PeeWee in the first two wave so now it's bouncing back and let's probably go hard shoves this will go to the red side of the map and Black overextend to fight for farm so he made the lame walk to go to spot word if you could be gay as they know they're safe from pancakes for a Honda shovel be no problem playing at Edwards on that side really good Roman To The River by Vulcan as well because that would be where Santorum would be waiting if you was planning against bottom and it just allows blabber to get a 5-pin clearly on have to watch out of this kind of crap do I think he may have been expecting santorin to be elsewhere because he's not going to get anything done by being the river here can I get something done right there it got on the road over actually. I would have done it and unlawful to help our love but lately I've been my fault so even if even if you ever did get the markings on the bottom one regardless loses both anyway. Thanks for 3 called when it has not done that yet so I sent her an up a camp up and vision felt flattered though at least we have fast for farming and goes back to his house as well to spot out the ward the tent when was just able to place but so overall bladder keeping off Central and hasn't necessarily taken something over yet and the game is yet to break open one thing that I want to touch on quickly here in terms of why this matchup can be exciting is how much better flyquest has looked since Adam solo and for those you have an Australian following solo he's a player who didn't have a team in the offseason and side with flyquest as it assistant coach halfway through the split to Denbigh thrust into the starter position kind of right before playoffs and has played the vast majority of playoff games for this team it's just been almost like this story book split for solo and now going up against licorice I was reading in some of the threats yesterday just wanted to call out how impressive that story has been in it would be just even more ridiculous if he was able to somehow pull off an upset today Yaki solo the only player on flycast has not been in some kind of important final Already Here Pay challenge final performance overall syllabus absolutely been a standout performer and instead of last half of the split and it is part of the reason why you know my brains as well as a chance here it is his paws Lane matching up baby to what liquids can offer as we look at the early Lenny faces of course licorice is us people with sports team fight Powers very strong in the Lord and the power of Santorum patch on right now and there was first Blood 6 minutes in bulk and gets away to safety but same tour and Stripes first in the final and here's the red flag that was thrown up and see how he's draft is the fact that if Pantheon get on Kindred ultimate that was obviously ignore take Scarlett to Charlie game doesn't get experience with what they got other teams in the playoffs yeah very impressive stuff right now to you fly Quest if you take a look at his fight yet again it's too bright Hook off of work I mean if they tried to scatter off that control because they knew blitzcrank was going to be coming didn't react to flash the hooks. Maybe you'll be able to sidestep afford especially when near terrain that's blitzcrank's favorite place for you to be because it doesn't give you any past the Juke the only way they could avoid that book based on the path you took would have been with flash now I'm take a look at the other parts the bathroom real quick as soon as he's being hands of lopsided for power of evil this is us doing a very good job with the early game good job of the Jungle great job in mid and if so low safe up here on the top side but she is still catch up with topland Farms well yeah and I think with blabber doing his best to stay competitive in the farm game that he's unable to help set up any types of Dives that would otherwise happen around powerful solving set so what's interesting about this game is I feel like C9 and drachenfels advantages in the top and the bottom Lane but because Kendra can't safely invade the jungle of flyquest do ^ Pantheon they can't convert on any of those who's which is why the game is so low and kills just blubber can't move or he normally would like to move sent to Central and right now going towards what he wants to eat to the topside for this Rift Herald Cloud 9 are running over both can see if I fly Quest that said this summer play Cloud 9 by the slimmest of margins keep her alive and steal the rift are getting narrowly avoiding disaster actually because they grown got five people if lava would have died there would have been really bad it's also dangerous to
