Musso & Frank I think in terms of momentum probably a little bit towards Griffin but it's too hard to say we've seen Griffin actually win one game after being down to vote in the summer find if it has Katie and then lose the series Invictus gaming pull back from attempted riversweeps like last year at world again Katie so can't wait to see how this series continues to play out there looking for what's different in the pick and ban LeBlanc knocked off the table we looked at you know the game 3 traffic looks so similar to the game 1 through to where we had a big does on the red LeBlanc was a big factor there blue side has been what's dropped by Griffin in this game to potential Nang or Tarzan Champion base open we already mentioned solo queue this is a three-way Flex the Griffin even to the boat Lane as well so no surprise it is over officeand we didn't see a kill back so we know that the LeBlanc value with how well rookie played in game 2 is still incredibly High wouldn't be too surprised if we saw a fairly High party on Kale bi-ig maybe brackets here as well right that's one can spend the night from Invictus every single time they finally get it here it is there go to start they did win a game of the forest that was the Arsenal game back in the very first one that's why they drew a bad for it on my block coming in directly a happy about her know we will take them or we will take this away IG content Griffin actually Piper was 7 and one point in game 2 and ended game 3 8 no but he was also the kale we've been talking about self in a lot of waysthese teams are still prioritizing exactly the same Champions that they have for the whole series actually not that much your adjustments throughout the series which I think is barely fitting since these are too confident teams and all three games have been fairly close as that weird thing with Griffin lost came to on the blue side with very simple similar Champion choices and yet if you can have that 18 minutes over again you kind of have to take it as a top-10 please. Far ahead with that strong an early game and yes copy result orientated about the WL at the Edwards how great the other day I went to see if they just go super standed blueside get two games in a row on the side of birthwhy do vans come through with more jungle pressure down getting again rid of magic damage junglers dragons at least definitely talk to you they're the Yas when it was paired smells great as last time that was gone do you reckon Griffin could go driving galio skin could they actually run back exactly the same thing came, they hadn't came through because they banned of a Blog which was the one thing they found access on to Pfeiffer as a possibility as well with a yasso band coming through so I'm going to see if they just really do fully roll a backwood find a hybrid because the jungler would be at go I think actually would at least in open they probably go least in AP made the possibility you could also be something that a lot of the lck teams that huge priority on this world that against kale talking about rookie year play the intro maker won that game for the kill themselves going to leave that one up to chance we'll see what that ends up going the Scion we're expecting to go in the mid lane but I can still move about based on how they want to play this one I could easily see Uncle John is going to come through really hasn't worked in a long way home and find this in the early game unlikely 0.8 Katie jungle doesn't have cc to try to kind of laying really and then it just all falls apart so because the battle so you can get laid virtual ago but came out late game to carry it through I'm really curious to see how the atrox I'm at your place because of the nurse for patch 919 that hurt the boxes with clear I wonder if he's just going to be a male a champion to get shoved in and they're hoping for maybe some type of cactuses or if they can get priority over mid then they can start controlling the river against the car that you can be one of the first four to five levels are actually as good or better if it's the mid-to-late game that he talked his way up there now falls off in this world so I'm expecting a good base now the game actually plays out though back against the wall to take reliable jungle Carthage can you seal the deal here and then go in the game 5 and do it all over again Invictus gaming go have a talk with him unless they have fish guy who is the best top laner in this matchup buy a bar back on back ready to carry flea has well this is going to be an exciting game for how does IG roll from the fountain here Griffin keep a lot of that piece of similar on their last game on the blue side honestly over the series Once Again being gift-wrapped desire rack on Facebook if we go to a game 5 that will not stay true you'd have to think so and just to recap a little bit about how these team got here Griffin had one of the best individual days we've ever seen of worlds on their second round robin going 4-0 putting up a seven-point to kill to death ratio on that day and then I G while they did look good in group stage did not win the group they still have that world championship roster all five members now from that 2018 World team starting here jumped out in the series to a 12-lead despite some clothes game kind of all of us were holding our breath to see if Griffin will just kind of roll over and die they did not in that game and now we're in this refreshed series really to see if Griffin can continue to play solid games or if I G can find another crushing fight to end the series but has famously never really had too much game consists lot of cops out there and I know you're out there somewhere I'll ask the ones I'm just Powell if I'm impressed out and then just play that particular place that works when your lanes are at the moment you fall behind don't have a lot of power with a really influence the result from that stuff you need a lot of planning and X is getting the right matchups and also just wave states to be able to allow cops to do is think about the way these Lanes could play outside work on should be a favor to me to against Ice Tea Leoni even if there is some skill matchups to play and it can be close to the chase should be able to beat the killer Lee and if Joey can get Lane priority over rookie which at least a level one looks like a can they have the potential to play that Tree whinning Lane with a farm in Carthage style but when the jungler comes in states where jungle come Spotlight level 3 can take every Zen inflate and not care at all about the enemy jungler will get counter pills that for the jungle ability for the strongest ganking junglas vs at X Anon ganking jungler that just means a lot of power and thing which is that you know a double-edged sword because of how little actual Bond fight in the bottom side put it back there was just talking about going to be there in just go with that the lead singer of Jarvan you're second-guessing whether or not you can go for that level to play similar situations over it would be pretty exciting a couple of packs in there for a rookie but the Top Lane going similarly as well at with how much pressure we're seeing it actually try pushing and sort again not afraid of a karthus gate coming through as likely not to die so able to farm pretty well so far these lames looking decent will point out that Toby Wilkins rookie V length and stand against the goddess jumping is going to camp for Camp. Does just mean he's going to have pretty good idea about respawn time is on both sides and make it more informed can test on future phones but it does mean to cause any thoughts are you going to get the rest out is topside trick shot for his troubles and that's maybe not worth it still has some potions leftover pulled one back to that gets him happy. Back anyway things going to come by these okay grab that one it's Dylan unspotted name at the moment if short ends up going for an over-aggressive trade taking that his jungler has control you're like the strangest maybe on a 400 Health though you know on to the JC it just because it's broader scale so because of that probably not going to be fine but she was revealed earlier and continues to investigate hoping that was camps cats a really good knock Capelli almost gets rid of a jackula that's a lot of damage knocked down though A-line spawning an entrance ear damage Landing cars excuse on the shiz got to be some type of nightmare impressed with how well this has been able to Juke historically so there was a little bit of time there for Tarzan to stick around all those Grom has responded I wonder if Nick is actually able to counter drunk a little bit pretty Proteus minimap backwards no worries. This is more than you would expect necessarily out of Lane impact so that's something that Jace can potentially take advantage of lost sword but the way Frozen for now under is terrible stop to reset it was a full wave still there in the group inside and it's a teepee comes through for sort of the week or so they come through for sword looks like the time we go to shove it without much issues so not going to do too much should reset no problem maybe even the nicest csr2 as if he comes back to the store that sell FedEx you will deny if you're a little bit of pee and we look at these hoplite now reset again with fairly equal farm and arguably better items on sword rookie still holding fairly equal to Midway michova Anthony about his match up and it's going to continue to improve for a little while here with Mommy Cinder he'll be able to shove in quickly but ning hoping for that game what a predator boots and sword is looking to push up now the time is right there and sort of the body slam that's a really good flashed is the correct direction to put start certainly be done by noon right there there was always going to be that game Chicken about whether or not your flash you're getting your body slam off and he cuts them off enough to not let the sword get away and then you know the source of an opportunity for a counter kill this guy was in front not letting the shot glass blow back to me and the counter play by gryffin do is to also get the ocean Drake LBC good to pick up an early ocean Drake here even the carthus is going to be a big fan of this and really wants to feel blue It's relatively greedy but he can kill a pretty fast God of War but no one's around the top of what he's going to explain that one this might even available if he needs it got to be able to save that one on top of it there so early on top of it, short of level 6 on MacArthur being played by The Flash. Shows the right time to do it I wonder if it was a full disengage Avail from the he was thrown out to prevent the flash back towards the church but now with a flash list Jace who just has the wave in the wrong spot to try to be able to do them off for a while quite a lot here and yes give me a pill called idea but the Drake is something the issue is that now the shy probably is going to always at worth go for cs4cs maybe even get more kills and get more head-on cage and we already know how that pays off in the late game you have to hook the car this is what I want to see if this guy is actually continuing that freeze because if he holds that he's going to be able to get a massive CS Advantage there's control Ward Supremacy in that Top Lane Shorewood basically have to push up past halfway without Flash in order to even get farm and less Tarzan goes up there and help them shove it in there was like he is a ward doubt he's been fairly slow here so this is certainly a lot of money being lost and it likely gets worse from here and slowly but surely he's going to be okay is alright finally have stored and rain but sort of feel like outside right lens that q but nothing happens without the biggest bear in the shop I let the wave sit in front of his threat of flash was Jace how do you survive the Kraken stick is the reality show out play possible on that and that's why he does have a spotting no matter I know is he's on cool down to the surprise of the opportunity what's a sweeper where's the board there's the word okay that's or running away and once again look at the rookie gets all three sweet spots going to be knocked up either starting to fight back now with 20 CDR in the bill either Shore needs to leave.
