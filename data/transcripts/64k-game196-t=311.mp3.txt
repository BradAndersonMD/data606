give us another good game that lets you select has begun to pour steam switching sides does get flight least I need and pick van having a screaming against each other they went screwy against the other group so I expect different pic coming out this round-robin that we did in the first place so there is a week and a half of learning to dance like boxer the bot and everyone else is doing it was a different game here in previous world if you come in and you play an ultimate app if you don't have the exact read maybe you have a certain sperm group that's going one way I mean Kayla seems to be that takeblvl teams a real famous I having these really terrible raised on the matter of the one of those time Premier jungler world so far that he had a phenomenal black tape beating up a pick it up in the mid and topple and I think the rookie on Jake. He's incredibly aggressive however I already like very aggressive and the progress is something that I used to get most of their Mickey and initiations the first time they played looking across at the jungle Olaf as well seems like a fairly IG specific address World Championship is now not only has like on plated it's what being locked in his first game going to be exciting. Injective grab some magic David Vladimir's a top laner and then some bands make the mastiff look easier could be take me somewhere and I think it when you have a look at the LPL is a Region's aisle with 100% priority to spend all the time when these guys are playing in playoffs they serve at least still seem to pay you for it over the potential make them that you can get out of the car for safety and self-reliance of Zaya he's incredibly High Jackie love that was very consistent throughout LPL summer meat to put in a good performance I want to be take a pic I also don't mind it as the final pick of the first phase because it's kind of forces that work on ban when they're still likely looking to counter pick their final table planer for the shy so that's one fewer toppling Camp you're going to be able to ban looking at the band we might just end up seeing a GP vs. black match up and that's why I asked you end up going for the bottom airbag fuse go to Blind top cleaner is Rumble play it twice so far already probably likely to get the GP on his hip and they've already removed one of the counter picks and Vladimir has available. They can take both right here if they wanted to go to the options right now they do need both so late with Nautilus go somewhere a bit unorthodox locked in for number one I think Mammoth midlane a triple X I don't know if there's anything going to be at some point but it's not very likely I would have preferred to see a rise here but I can understand maybe if rainbow has no Comfort all kind of hybrid tank because of that he's going to be some balance given to this call Arianna rookie has a very good pic or he's mad that Victor stays where it is everything else that is going to be the most standard versus caixa no surprises the Victor a rare sight brackets you know of course we so I can see him but nothing on the Olaf that's enough yeah that actually is the first Victor I just got confirmation that the 93rd unique pick Orban we've had to throw a camping trip started I want to focus in on IG called because we hate me I'm getting me all laughed and Olaf with pushing land is one of the most attractive junglist to pull the post pictures and then when you have a look at the range support into me like this could be nice build a Denny's return to summoner's Rift and I think they're trying to set him up for Success if we look at IG early game in week one or even in the summer split it was subpar and that's completely different than the world champion IBEW we saw in 2018 so it looks like they're trying to return to that for welcome to summoner's Rift 04 not to start the quarter-finals anymore they must pick up Invictus gaming back to their old starting jungler and then they benched him ever since their first round of the LPL playoffs they put them back in the day victory and as we didn't propose I do just want to draw people's attention to the Top Lane Keystone because Wallace this guy tried to Stave off any comparison to notary coming into the world championship he does himself out by kleptomancy Jace instead of the phase Rush Jace that you may see sometimes against the GP if he wants to be able to go in and out of fights can't completely fault them for it though sometimes you get a lot of lanes to stain out of a cup of Nancy which I think is one of the most underrated parts of the Keystone eating and then threatening that game that will come through from probably is a. Yankee jungle I think it's bad to say in that Gregor soap dish I know is he's going to be trading heavily needs to have extra tools to be able to pick that sustain up a couple of other interesting case Stones as well we can have a spell book on Victory in the mid lane which is a little bit strange what does lend itself to some feta team flight options he will have to be able to teleport back to Elena's kind of have Victor's kit Works he needs that go too early for them being able to swap over to things like the cleanse and the ghost photographer could be pretty useful Stephanie could be we'd know that it was a rookie who pause ready to see what the cause of that one is but it will get that to you once we get the information out of this one just needs to get to wait a little bit longer that that anticipation building up to wait to see you could it's going down I'm definitely excited to see how this one does pan out again we talked about the last time these teams met neck-and-neck age to have some leads IG had some leave it up to about 23 minutes a very tight game yeah and focusing in on what we'd expect from this early game IG is looking to blow them out yes we've already mentioned multiple times that the early game was in favor of age do the first time around so I can't completely fault HQ for picking a little bit more scaling specifically with the Spellbook Victor over something like an aerie Victor at least have a little bit of fighting Power in lane cuz Brooky Soriano consumer that match up a Jace can also get very aggressive really not to mention having his eye in the bottom line it actually is 3 better early game champion and Olaf so if this game does actually get to 15 or 20 minutes even that would be bad news for idg when we got a note on rookie said it was a mouse issue somebody with sensitivity a we are now getting ready to go from the players of that might have been thought about maybe going to the game very shortly and I think that when you have a look at how he hates you have been able to have a couple of successful against a lot of it as being around rainbow and Alex so having that smell will fix it doesn't really lend itself to Gainesville that much is very interesting for me I want to see how Alex know it's a silly game that he has another Avenue to play around writerly sweeper going to share the XP I should help the swelling a little bit there tengo two-piece level throughout the past way we got to be a pretty big deal for me to stay yell at each other in Scream to try and get that one over as quickly as possible so I think that's interesting because what I've seen from Rookie that makes me think he's back in form is his ability to leave Lane if he doesn't feel like you can get that solo kill and we sort against to yell when he was playing this Ariana into Jensen's akali feasibility of the shell from Impact bottom line on something as simple as the Ariana was certainly a very key factor in that victory running has begun rookie Ortiz play for the rest of the leaves live in a fight with the very beginning of this one has grass and not bad for this one this guy forced to run away but they're going to have another keep it shakes going nice that helps a lot with even though any kids going well through the minions right there but that's always what she pees look to do is wait in that brush to get the early traits I'm a little surprised too shy get decide to run right through there rather than going to save route on the bright side you probably got a little bit of a cold but it cost him with his health bar in the reason that's very interesting to me yeah I got your phone cool in the first sight couple of trades right there early hopefully goes to Wauka have really nicely played that but what I was going to mention is it back to the shop I don't seem to have a wart on the blue box so we notice right now that I like to is popping down that make me think the plank as aggressively as if it was burning through potions isn't necessarily great unless he can get that waive into Target cuz could open them up to things games on this first clear and I'm going to be tracking how nice dinner it's only because one of the big reasons it was rumored that mean wasn't playing anymore is Just Energy with either rookie year the shy and how out of sync the team ended up being all the Wayans wanted to play aggressive all the time being also wanted to get his two and it just didn't work which is potentially why getting in a seventeen-year-old younger like Glee on with beneficial to the team because they could kind of dictate where he passed name's not that type of player usually do I want to see if he ends up actually camping for the shy for instance in this game Alex is down to the bottom River but not going to find a gank for himself a full three camps behind the opposing junglas or nothing with you. Don't get me wrong this is a little too par for the course but they remain up those camps and might see in a couple things up here and he might even invade because that's actually a ghost poro that got left behind off of the early Ward they had on the blue buff so actually skip the Scuttle crab and the blue box to take a look up here and the 22 because it was actually uncanny how is it backed away right there absolutely no vision really just playing the Timex I think what would have given that away is the fact that for them is sitting so much in the morgue on Elena not actually fighting for the priority at all then dropping the W on The Great Wave and trying to push you out so you see if knows that he's the one laying under threat right now playing respectfully playing the match up appropriately and looking for the vision they can collapse on him here that's gone and out it goes this is exactly how we expecting to play that is not a high percentage play he stopped playing is frozen he has no support coming in from at midlane as wealth but he still goes for it now sitting on a ward he's getting so much attention to the tribes Lane already swept that brush before to make sure it was clear overall it ends up being completely fine for ding but as you mentioned spawn already a few Touch N Go place nighttiming their overall though still is a can't believe you can see 25 to 32 and CS that is the early start here for nothing and if they can't respond at Grandpa's up and start getting some more yes there's 7cs that Victor can clean right now for a lot of is helpful he's going to end up missing probably at least one range meaning of this he's already down a teleporter rookie rookie is absolutely dominating it's even worse for Victor early because you get 1150 gold before getting your first augment upgrade and whenever you've had to take an early recall on Victor to go for a Doran you using other lanes not going that well I need you had to play aggressive hold a thought and now that's going to find a song not going to burn this time does Bell's Hill truck down first part of the brackets and now they're going to want to be to going to chase the prettiest actors on Siri where you trying to go out of the gravity field for the move speed but miss calculating the stun duration by a fraction if rookie flashes early he's probably away but he thought that he would be enough to get him to grab his jungle it in this matchup just because this is Nick has returned and I Feel Like This Is Me Badd on not shadowing the lane hot enough that sprays was set up so obviously from Rainbow do you know the truth she is going to want to get that plane is a tarp because otherwise he's going to be denied old he's going to be tonight experience Ming should be that the that's a mistake and you can almost imagine if rookie just move towards they probably wouldn't that too but the lack of synergy between that hasn't running away from his jungle as well so not only couldn't have been closer towards him do you even have the right side of the lane all those would have an options in either way we look back at the state of this game in the bottom Lane and it's about equal in cf4 for Jackal to pick up and so I'm going pretty close to equal Wars vehicle you're not the one that forever this is what priority gives you this is what the ability allows you to do is a jungle of being able to pull over your support and all you can see already rookie acadians at fog of War how everything is very low this could be a bye this could be us rainbow trying to do that instead and finally does knockdown Nick Drake reset
