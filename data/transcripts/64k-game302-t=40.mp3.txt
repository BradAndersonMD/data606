I was never gone their way and it to get ourselves a chance like you see that name spirit is back in for Mowgli and we'll see how much of an impact that make one game to reset his mental after losing game number one he also go to Whatsapp coughing but it feels like consistently Cloud9 I found in the strong skirmishing advantages and they probably need his experience in case it seems I cannot be stopped at last game or so heavily behind in the solo Lane get able to fight their way through a movement on top and a lot of Good Counsel played was already afreeca freecs going with the same man that we are off the table and change with Alex regarding he's knocking his first victim now the atrox can go over the keys but I really like thisNocturne should be an imposing figure it's not going to be here at World the ultimate paranoia taking away vision from the enemy team is strong and fluff out add to the champion of disorganized enemies not being able to coordinate their abilities mean so much to Cloud 9 with a tried-and-true combinations in North American LCS that first use this combination worldMountain World War II sand sang I need a champion that can pull my back line to safety start Diamond Phillips on to the Saints Racine I'm still open ended in her composition already got the most often even if you incorporate early I hate you are able to do it earlier in the tournament if your proactive you find deleted to find my protein you need to either take a priority for Nacht Der Untoten thumbs up or you will be very far behind in the team by here we go though toplessstill coming through the atrox will not be a third game In This Cloud 9 lots of Butterfree could get dipped first and they have not been Lucian so if KY system superframer I think you expect to see Luke and sent a lot of heavy I like the band over so much hard crowd control and no damage with the one victory yeah Kramer definitely on a comfortable pick but it feels like Mickey could go right back to the Lucian different been so successful for Cloud 9very good Atlanta harassment with the arrows but we should also had is very quick and we'll see if we can get the Dodgers off and it's benign of looking at back of my neck is your right solution still going to be three times in a row but it's most likely there for liquor store seems very common here in the lineup. Aureus would be the pic pic 14 in that way we once again be attacking Lane we seen no Dowry is so far but a big big for him in the regular season and a good matchup into on something about liquor it there no hesitation by the way in with the lock in the Pharaohs really comes into play and I'll have a lot of damage having a Galia on your team means that there are other options were engaging you don't need the top winner to be the mainthis is good in parts of summer season but the lck have allowed to eat outdated and impact orientated met up with a lot of play making a specially towards the early game now the Brom which are the moon which brings it all together we should talk about licorice play on tanks are you alluded to it very early in the series freak of the origins of the player and his one-v-one abilities but his tank play has also been one of the biggest strengths of Cloud 9 volt the orange starting off device as well as the poppy denying enemies become one of the most well-rounded players on the whole team would have given over counter pickerel Lane Focus Champion three times and Cloud 9 would still have Come Away with the victory which allkiss you so much more confident looking forward to a tough semi-final in Provo 9 to have coming for themselves but a freak is not native beings placing outdated but he's still have the options to react well if the lights come back on and a galio thumbs down. Can look good games Lincoln answer as well and we are in for Game 3 about that will represent a victory but with Cloud 9 having so many games have the ultimate doesn't feel like that's been the story of 2018 well and we mentioned stronger counter of Nocturne in 2 gal of being able to the ultimate however that's an also pretty good stuff counter to making gangplanks job more difficult in landing Barrel chain you can't see that far into the darkness at the enemy's make this very difficult to put those together I'm not saying very far through the best either at the moment but I'm going to try and keep it together for this gamehope for Korea the last seeds a possibly eliminated before semi-finals even arrives in season 2 of the 2012 with talking about there has been a trying to reach for them and you expect you to have more early-game pressure than spend staring here Nocturne pretty famously a farm to six jungler Bragg as we saw and Spirits game one gets plenty against off early game and well nocturnes definitely wants to get to level 6 as quickly as possible to deathly have to be careful under estimating the ability of the champion in early dueling as well the fear tether as well as the attacks will you can get from blocking a spell I do have some significant threat should be played around and is something to keep in mindsomething I'm hoping for institutions threat this game away from the Alistair is going to be a step up in his last game we count is 3 form its head. Pulverizes it's too late on the plate of nachos or after shock till after the whole trade half did Anne Frank write their attacks does significant damage as well do so start drinking early and Spence can watch over Ward how much of the Jungle Spirit takes away if you have that blue buff trade we had earlier on in the series or if he does lock topside and looks for this 1/2 L Thorn he knows there's no possibility of a kind of cake with a Nocturne on the bottom side where the scary things about your situation especially the early game is so explosive Bodyslam flash is something solo laners complain about so frequently however if a Nocturne is there until a lot ofespecially with them having this year started the trend of taking lethal Tempo huge attack speed on stop on top of your death bring herself Spirit you can see why doesn't want to go to aggressive this early has been scaring elf set up for a free spirit Spirit knows where he is but that's warm and how about the Pearl. Porterfield Shields first 5% Karen don't you not to underestimate the lethal Tempo Auto attack damage coming out of the doctor. Early and Spence Karen Mills Auto Baxterwhen does the volume bike frame and find out they don't have to run faster flash out as well for southerners ready for 390 light at the end of the tunnel here for Africa free as soon as it starts to go bad Spirit dies immediately answer here from Kramer on the bottom side to sand gets his igniter doesn't die and they find the kill on to sneak in the two on to buy finally what does ferrous freshland have some control around that fuel and it's so far has been a black mark for a frickin Fricks in a series of so far as gone very far away from them they need to pressure points that I can't rely on that jungler is a big tail between his legs after giving up first Blood could easily be there in the bottom Lane now temporarily 60s up in a freaking freezing up 700 gold trading with so how he goes against and tries to force me to a battery call I will also mentioned as we take a look this replay will go through this one person see how it all started how to thin on Tuesdays over then he decides to take the fight into the Aftershock already bought the big night down framer no hesitation flashes for fines home with the air strike through and find the first Blood really smart by Kramer when they engage on your tank support hit the enemy Marksman he will die faster and with that choice blew through all of us being at Summers including the cleanse sneaky I got that kill picked out but I will say that for the top side even though Spirit did. I been scaring didn't immediately get to go path up to try and keep this Gangplank on it so he has been farming away with this leftover pushing the orange close to the turret and he is warming up that is definitely going to be a quick level 6 are coming in from these top laners both of those level six in are going to be very big for possibly be creating a place on the map elsewhere and Kane was probably out best games like over in Korea still play this one without a metaphor most usually depends free but because again Sonoran is still available and Spence Caron still Level 5 and only does pinging that level five you're booked on the bottom side pedicures near by five for ghosties Jungle is this better than no Spirit of Seattle self in a three-on-three what is my going to go nice for the season for the lights out nearly planning. Q is Kramer from Top leaders we are looking for immediately lose actually they did a girl the dragon he jumps right back out with the claw do notify both the teleports have been working with that can lead to get a Sheen licorice just teleported back now as well to refill of health and Mana bar so licorice will not join the bottom line to join any fights again but just a couple minutes honestly keep your eyes on that bottom late fee support Arlo Health early on in the game they both blue their flashes and not soon approaching the level six. It's already got his eyes down there though and he's coming through a lane game controller down they know that C9 cannot account for his replacement yet and I must play safe we don't have good ways out cleanse up super sneaky that might be a Saving Grace into a hook look for the soonest available or a Freak the freak out if they want to come it's very hard you could see a movement from Kuro from the mid lane but they're going to attack and Spirits away is most important drops for the side of C9 able to get that Advantage Westfair a bit of a passenger not available and they both go down gold traded fairly evenly make Africa was surprised that Nocturne was level 6-1. Jungler would Mainline Pam was still at level 5 and that seems to be the initial surprise squishy supports like you mentioned earlier your go down and now the reset happens with a map State pretty even all things considered and speaking of map state that kills are on framer Africa their biggest week Flint was arguably the bottom Lane as they could not handle the Lucian Lane this time around both killed and a pharmacist there is could be the one to take the game to the late Kramer was also the one who stepped up in a huge way for Africa free in their change from a week 1 of groups to going 3-0 on the second week of group and also he stepped up for the team in the playoff Gauntlet because he wasn't playing in the regular-season aiming was preferred for the boss Matari.
