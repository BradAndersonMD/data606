map he might young and Laura Lowe have got to get more done if they will be successful I got to get them about my things back to his rookie split back when he was on Phoenix one he had better numbers you think back actually who Mike Young's rookie split what are the other rookies that during the same time was nisky to and then Mike young having a really poor performance kayak she has the lowest bass on his team across almost all Dimensions right now Katie a conversation even damaged so it's been a really rough road so far three in eleven in the roads are getting eliminated certainly going to be a rough road for them if they if it were to make it but it's extremely unlikely anything and it's not just within his demons really leak why do he has been the worst performing Douglas physically speaking at the very least so you're looking to see Mike young get back on track show us some of the pop off game but he had really made a name for himself when he was going to perform back onthe case while we are into Champions like with the bands coming through expected you mean car message wannee also dropped off the table so tsm's turn the first big hero around and here's what they see as well as a rock in here are very likely will be going pot or has been looking to see if if it were taken away but I think with both those off there's not really much point because you're going to have one or the other yeah it seems that people are really prioritizing more now going away from the character in Fort Worth that Tom kench I don't think it's going to get locked in this early on a specially when you are taking into consideration the fact that Tom kench is likely paired up with Sona which denies lot of work you know what to do or of course I want to see what sort of texture at the bank account looks like Isaiah the entire draft now toplay around with a soda comp is going to look like typically they really turn on the mid game around two to three items you can sustain through all the poking at the Box immediately going Telemark been trying to go high DPS baby pushing through ceiling. Would come out and I hope you had a giant working to do the heavy lifting picking a rate in this position to draft traditional you'd be worried okay what if they don't you know you're going to be able to grab that work on as your neck fix so Porky certainly securing their carries early on but Tom kench Quest yeah he's a tremendous amount of global pressure oven times tables what kind of trade different sat there and looked a mess with any Global fresh and gold pressure brought out by their opponent but is this case guess I'm Canal look to drafting a strong top-line for example and hardly heavily towards that and it could be tough racket box build a match because it's locked and I think this would have draft State favors the team in the red side cuz they get first dibs on the timer and counter pick on topand blue can't do anything about that here we know it's not a Comcast Spotlight we know it's 90% EF mid do we have seen that move around in some cases but of course you do have the fact that you're certain got a cup full match up to the stop light for Keith that this is okay I'm comfortable comfortable but I am looking incremental leaves on the last half of this raft Lane matchups go that should be the edge the question then just becomes mechanical fox actually plays that out or get enough of the lane Advantage because the early can has certainly not been their strength and you know when you get to the midden late game TF2 taunt control thing everywhere things can get very hectic it's not necessarily going to pick 4 in the counter picks we might see Laura Lowe bring us what it is if he wants to play here is one final been coming through a kind of whittling down the jungle pulled and pick him up from theredoes really feel like they're setting up for us before Style game who do you draft a very strong top-liner something that perhaps you are a new could be struggling in a could be a good matchup into to set up for something along the lines of a 45 a composite want to drive from Port of a tank but it is pretty interesting that you are a very strong later these days especially people have been going grass fence or 3 and just utilizing you stand essentially it's going to get you through the early Lenny faces scale towards a later stage of the game where we know if you're is so strong but excited to see broken play to bring out something along the lines and play some of the more difficult matchup do you have all these can be so I could come to that side lane assist you and broke a blade blade at once already that flipped around probably but I mean at least would bewe have kind of seen it proven that when Sona is being drafted you want to go early and punish it usually when people try to display possibly it doesn't really work out for them so at least alongside rakan and xayah that is going to be a very aggressive set of Champions you have to engage you have the potential to do look at play Greta Lee and dive as well that's the one I like it since I was here when the clutch is still very strong in the jungle very cool. So as far as what third straight game today that I have seen them and yes it did get your that that can a buck with Grievous wounds attachment to this the second part of your cue, but I do think it was fairly strong before that in and just that the worst player taxi try it out and are having success with it especially Instagrams it's such a powerful Champion one plate aggressively that I can have a lot of success but I don't think people have been utilizing led to itsthis is not a farm without play even style scampi this is a get aggressive all sound cool down looked at her a dive to reset the thread a girl with with the dismounted be sort of place if you're not going to do that you're not going to bother us we'll see if he can play custody against is Papi's o Laurel brings out of toppling tank and if we are the champions they got some bus in dispatch if you can trust you with her W you are grounded and float for two extra Second Chance flashed away can't either run away the wall slam could be coming solo is the second tank on the roster spots open in Gainesville open follow up Mike young hoping to find some early gamepress Amanda has won Total assist across this summer split tree in the ALCS pre 15 minutes really really like the echo Fox draft you know if I was going to turning off the name places looking at a distant early for the draft style of life I think I slept very well as in coffeefight well into Clyde it's very easy to actually do interrupt the cloud with your W on Poppy and before that many suns there and this is something we're likely we're going to see a DTF you can stack Parmer fairly heavily the Sona is as well as you know this is jungle Silas probably are not going to be enough of a threat to force Mr coming out of the poppy so I would be interested to see where Laura Lowe does go but if you can kind of sustain yourself not fall too far behind the cloud your wedding is going to be very powerful and then I do think that they have the tools to actually engage in and look for a fight against things like the TF and the Sona when you have this work on when you have your least you have these way to get in and it really strong back line of his eye on the court date we are ready for the Oscars get back underway is TSM faces Echo Foxthere's got to stop demasi Twisted Fate fans better to do teams on as well anime tattletales matchups do indeed flight out and what kind of early Russian we can get out of the Jungle and I will be very very interesting certainly know if you get it I had enough on 8 matchups but he can be really tough to actually snowball a game onto because it doesn't have like enough true damage no kind of in the kit a long line so if you are something just like a hundred year was Hank under a trailer that can be very very difficult so I will see how much they want to commit to that side land because it does look like she also has has drafted this composition who actually no go top and looked do that but still like bring the slide to where the TF is and utilize clad ultimate for gauges and he sort of place but yes I'm certainly doesn't want to just fight front back by B5 they want to be more creative they want to get old man fight utilizing Comcast utilizing TF and also that cut altimate to to isolate members in and really pick them off and this is going to be I think a really fun game to watch because it is fairly Technical and how you have to play it out right it's so much. the execution I think you're 40 SM can they pull off the Sala play I think about the rest filled with on this roster for TSM side you got to Katie and here is stealing maybe not Zima Papio and knocking then abort taken away can be really exciting but otherwise I think it's the quickest is a reasonable engagement but kind of curious to see what it looks like he's mine 914 has sign those pages as well during the ultimate much longer cool down otherwise higher damage the Champions. Go up those earn some money trade blows with Sven Scooby train back and forth there and we'll see how aggressively and Alexis Pauline wants to play into this know so much of when you are playing work on it is Tom kendzia can you actually catch tahm kench as well as the carry in your engaging in 10 do that I didn't deny that is our that becomes very very powerful but you know that is also somewhat dependent on smooth Ian Spence backing up in front of making decision errors on their own if you can't see that it's fairly easy to actually stop what aqua wants to do here with for the symbols of our my friend on the top side pretty good damage work with playing at aggressively Laurel oh it's you that they should be in the first race and I love to see that that is exactly what you want to be seeing from a clutch player that this was Champion where you really want to get in their face utilize the early levels and in the power that you have with our email note to try to trade aggressively and then looked actually hold your W skill point you you hold on to that you don't actually level it up until you do Dismount and then you can actually use the violent tendencies to remount but Broken Blade has decided to it to level it up you can utilize that for for early trading but I do really think it can be quite powerful hold onto for almost guarantee against Atlanta temp right here is Preakness playing a bit aggressive way now and I can't going to show up as well but of course the jungle Ursula topper everything going as well rental cars Mike young people listen to she just popped off really stepping up in this early game to flash his well-being was there this initial engage here from Echo Fox and I'm coming across on the Pearson the gold card is up by Mike Yung flash hit the Cocoon and once they actually live that so much damage was down you can no longer take this fight to Acadian really should not be off to use this but he goes into the one be to take so much damage flashes out the easy repel over the wall here for Mike young and in the phosphorus bomb another cocoon does Lan and they're able to make it at 240 in the middling you'd pick up there I can fax them off to a thousand gold lead off those killed hopefully get some of those further early game at least finally comes through waiting so many weeks for this kind of really came out of my youngin might be too little too late we can hope it's not as the top link bush is coming in small see asleep for Laura Lowe holding on just fine also worth noting double bus on Phoenix says they're going to engage on the bus side and damaged then we'll be able to survive of course but you didn't have to actually use his Tepee d'Alene he has three cups and bowls in charge of his know a biscuit double bus like that is a very hard laying out of play into the Sharon Hill right now the bottle is being pushed around is Apollo's down to very low man if he also has a freeze you can see and I hope your son is Flash lift and has to play somewhat afraid of what might be coming as a control board in the middle brushed just below Phoenix so it's a safe route for this Elise to take there's there's no vision heading into that brush with Mike young sleeps down to their bjorksten can't know for cfma do at least I know a couple words kind of guarding the top side of the Scuttle if it's worth as well here so they can have these pockets as Vision in that area you can try to play a bit more towards at top of the map board should cover any sort of Route coming past those wrappers as well so you at least know it's more likely that make him would come from the bottom side butt and even though that is true Mustang has bypassed Ellsworth bypass Kelly's bottom side right now yeah it's probably going to go for maybe you go so you can break right now when she responds but this right here and it'll be claiming the Drake get back in Atlanta follow simply walk back and Acadian skin wars but there is no flash deal division but not going to lose his life for this and they got their base off reset walk back to that dragon with items and you know easily are able to just knock down that Dragon so there's going to greet their leaning that much more you know how the ocean Dragon for all the additional regen you can trade more heavily this is extremely frustrating as well for Broken Blade when you're into a tank match up as a carry their able to get the ocean even if you poke him down are we going to be vulnerable then to just kind of getting wheels down and do it beautiful stuff right now but the game hasn't she shrunk get a little bit you only a $500 difference do courtesy or so I process a closer look at this. I'm not sure if it's odd I don't think it did I think he was just below it it looks like there's nothing to me or either so and he is going to be able to start up this Red Bluff he drops a pink on it as well that's a nice little lukowich for you to stop you do and could scrap utilize it later on before a little engages out of a charge it up with for a hex last time we'll see if he's going to be able to actually pull that sort of stuff off later other juice bottle now exiting the jungle so you can see Acadian was at the very least including that he would be down the boss sign is now matching that Redbox take away and more damage now I'll talk while and then trade some
