step by questor utilizing an app for a lot hit utility has been absolutely great and this one flyquest are getting playing in the first round of plastic question is which team will they face if they lose face it here at 4th Street facing if they win they take her spot away from TSM just like Teen Titans record they are 2 hours ahead they will take their adult face Evil Geniuses as their first-round The Immortal side a win means they tie dignitas and CLG and we will tie break for the eighth and final seed into playoffs even when they are alone and 10th and their season is done we'll see you in 20 21all right everything on the line here I like the band from Versailles honestly the set has highest priorities King in setting up on any teams plus they showed already in our highlight reel santorin flexing that pic to Jungle as well so give them a lot of Versatility out with that one off the board just go over to your farm and carry oriented jungler for Santorum for himself maybe he'll be taking the spotlight more in this game the thing with black was still in the way that they build their team's not power of evil on things like galio they almost always have tired of people on very good scaling I damage a p threat from the mid lane took control Mages really quick as Aunt from Mortal self they are going with the jungle in Vaiden Twisted Fate even with the wild-card Nerf going to go try and push in Rome for insanitycast game of split in the LCS for insanity and it's the first day as well if my dad's don't lie to me so look here when it matters most to get back against the wall you can not make playoffs if you lose this and you got a punch up against the top 40 on which beIN game yesterday he said look it's roughly desk app and ETSU Auto pretty much at all and it's got you two look good on a snap line and the Damage output is it too bad we'll see what the other goes for in this one you know it's the forces against TF wouldn't be surprised if he cleanse to drive to the gates out there we'll see what comes through at the end of the day it appears all Band Away anyway so is the number of Target so you're going after it with Target yeah it is it is good you get those Autos in but obviously it would be extinctTarget damage that's going to be adding support targets the worst that build gets I do like Immortals though like to your point of them stepping outside their comfort zone you're probably not going to beat black with a tank top with scaling AP mid like in Sandy had play you know he played a peacock MacArthur's Wiley's Farm up eye damage you know AP teams and and to set that up music by 500 CE just don't see you beating flyquest at that took some of the best attitude in that type of sleep. So yeah I like it they're going for a Smithy on did Elise see what he can do vs. Graves generally when Natalie and Graves meet each other in the jungle stare down contest unless there's some later than her acting just going to go your separate ways and and focus on the phone answer of course we're neither bot laners grab in the first phase of the Vixen dance that's the case right here so income the flag Quest band saying well okay the 80 karrie like a b t r pools with a wide tie to play whatever buthey what's good to thresh aggressive Batman is there on the hillside Theater Berkeley strong and should be played at Apollo has been one to pick up made it very quickly but have no physical damage you know that's the kind of stuff I mean to do that point specifically the little Karthik nurse didn't come into effect until 10:16 or so long 10:15 so yeah you're only problem is getting your big a deep threat but those types of venturing out into unexpected fix definitely can be rewarded in situations like this just for Apollo to bring his 80s and it's kind of weird too because you're thinking of in Sandy's champion pool and you like okay well he's pretty much only going to play a tank in the topside paint or like a bruise or like or got ityeah never really going to be one of those big split play shirt so if you're doing Twisted Fate it's more about like taking towards bottom side and getting bottom side of head rather than a lot of the other options that you see you later to the game with with Twisted Fate style and now I'm super curious with their saving last pic to support for hakuho yeah it does something part of gates really the only way to the store now I will say this does feel less like directly trying to save it and out of your find it anyway but it's like well we got to get or before it's banned if we got to get over before it's been tested by while fertile it's ended up tacos going last after or if he's going to go really well we're going to have to go charge my sanity fighting after its antifa people rely an alarm that should be enough we hope but I don't know what's going to go I mean I would even Monica's Ira put the minute or something but he's not going to eat that really brought out of that it's going to beyou can block to the hurricane both second field decent you can stop the ball from going to be for down like there's some interplay here but really Apollo going to be safe on the back line but there's nothing to decide to keep it again and everything on Apollo here like that that has to be the way that they win this game I'm very curious to see how the how the early stages go with with the Smithy on the Natalie typically has been a lot safer he is one of the lowest and counter jungling percentage has one of the lowest in 4% and all these are metrics of time that you spend in the opponent's side of the map and your phone is jungle take away their camps taking it you're creating pressure and getting division in Italy that is something that is greatly rewarded especially if you have a Twisted Fate on your team and one of the ways that combo is usually used is the in bed with Natalie trying to find them at a camp land of spirits with the Fey ultimate and or even set it up with a gold card but it isdon't pull off those plays then like they really got a fake on Apollo Caring Heart with Ezreal on his mid-game power Spike all right well we are in a regular season game of flight next weekend in the best-of-five because either golden guardian or Evil Geniuses if they win this one on the Immortals side if they lose their out if they win they have a tiebreaker got an invasion of the bottom side that's going to be a lantern learned early on he made safe for the wise though they're going to stay alive at least the attempt to make it more difficult for wildturtle to click he still gets the click off already plays it does for us about to go to add eggnog you really do tend to want sleigh and hooked if you can help it for the Lenny face because you can sometimes find yourself a Christian too aggressive there and the day though it's not the worst thing in the worldwith what is losing to their trinkets texted going to make a gangsta easier for santoor than it already is First Blood over half his games and now there's too much work to do it yep and it is going to be a lot on all. Good experience here with towards the bottom Lane given over to Turbo an experience as well and a little bit shared sense the sweeper was purchased by egnor all right results 20 each has now been torture to go for his least let's start topside it is kind of slow or that way around but at the end of the day it's not going to be a problem with the very easy and very safe to take down these camps solo pushed in early husband apple cider top winter just take it up to the front line you've got a filia story out of the back line not going to be a problem there for you with all really push goes Taco in Apollo either of course and level teeth come in all right so pay attention to bottom line routes from Santorum as well on graves clearing top to bottom and set up for attacking probably the biggest area that I have Mortals need to win India's Rio Bravo if you could try to stay as late as rules mid-game Spike that is just so big so you can try and set that as real behind and you kind of messed up is forcing an early teleport uses no forcing something where he doesn't get his new tier recalling is is kind of app that can be really big has the biggest strength of Israel is obviously when do you get your remind transformation in here and everything starting to come together at the right time and that will assist want him to farm effectively does it feels like a Triforce came through as well for even more damage in the mid game I feel like I said I'm going to go for here or the other Perfect Image let you know it gives more Mana you just nowhere close on a d even with the other hermana conversion it's from the red gun so you could even come through Rockwell shuts down there do I get to finish up that crap and pop the Bloom as well both Douglas already know and you assumed they they did the exact same routes trading top and bottom of crab in Italy meet up unless there's something like Lane interference with equipment lane or accused Rush Advantage where you get to throw out of line spear something like that it's it's not going to have a commitment and both of them are kind of just racing on power clearing and playing around the strength of their Lane in front of his house or just mentioning the gold of course really close to the game nothing is too absurd as happened very early on Xfinity keeping up with sand for that lie against Graves nothing is really kept them do what they want to do so farther even on the same camps right now with the cops are going down across the map and nothing to be concerned about just get into this one is like wasn't going to waiting around for more to do nice Brian hook for big. Wait to see when the first recalls do come through for a guy to make a Realms app and he's so good at getting around the mountains affect the other lanes damage for the turtle back nicely done there is. Late again is great slightly pushing I think I question if it's happening with the case right now so out of metal or shouldn't be any kill precious yet you can't little after damage so low I believe you talked to biscuit just to be safe but he's going to take the weekend alright so first reset for him on top side with c o u actually sticks around because of the risk you're talking about him chugging and bottom side will be the focus was sent to begin damaged lacrosse yeah okay no big deal. I was only health potions until we have more mad with the biscuits of my badges do the one quite correctly or who knows I'm done wrong it was on after all but regardless I think he's trying to find something better recall get the full Catalyst of the TV that's what you was waiting on you to the Catalyst in Lexington fillable Order channel. Spell regardless so listen to I can stop by there it is time to go buy it D be there you go waiting for the ambient gold perfect easy BS word for wild turtle back to shove into Canada wave I believe but with the not any slower than waiting for a different way so that's just fine save the coupons I can make it happen now its way towards Med and then I'm going to be forced to Flashlight really really nice stuff right nothing else to do it and apply for the 10 days that was a nice attempt then they do facts about to head up thank you sign up I am bored as though even though blacklisted a very good job turning into flashes on the bottom quadrant of the map because of the reset and portals get to take away the objective on the bottom half of the map first before flyquest can capitalize on burning those Summoner spells. Aqua even with his flag flown sommerfeld books which is right over now he's super defensive exhaust heal and even though they blow in settings Flash in Midland with the with the dragon God that's where I'm just kind of fishing around for more camps and it does get a silk wrap for himself but doesn't want to push his luck as always he does want to put this like as far as the kind of drink and drive back to the spawning Raptors as well because this is the also what you get out of a Teleport is a poly was able to instead of recalling what role did I walk to drink with Hillary calls and then just TP to get back to Lane in time to not lose any fun otherwise Apollo s Celtic to the great goes down sometimes that to just be not worth it right you're missing 200xp and 120 gold and exactly on your first by you usually head into something like this that is a power fit of a power trough Where You're vulnerable to gay guy stuff rocks play in from ignorance Jaco cannot be the Target in from Twisted Fate easy kill this is what I was supposed to pay it around the back of the blame for it and did not just around the map but Autumn Lane for sure they want as much possible Focus here for Apollo as they can for the says little for big big game Power Spike to try and carry the team he does give up most of it to replace a power people should be able to finish that one off so one turret plate for the first Bud play but really well set up by Immortals taco and once again he keeps on trying to go get brushed it off and Landing shoes on to Turtle he does get the Stray one there so as soon as I land Apollo doesn't hesitate pops right over the minions it would have dropped it there and even though it dies chasing really well X Twisted Fate ultimate another
