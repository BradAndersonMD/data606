a lot of wins the team seemed very happy now again it it feels so much it's right it's kind of backed up some of the problems that they have had in Spring where know at the end of spring-trap. Calling solution seems like it was for the first little bit of of the summer split and now hey they don't seem to really have the answers they are in a pretty heavy been trying some different things nothing is really working and I feel like this team really desperately needs to get some wins to build that confidence backup are losing the first time around a beat in the first round in the rematch is their losing games there wouldn't go for something is definitely going wrong cuz they were in first place at the end of week for that's no longer anywhere near where they are right now in fact with them earlier Wednesday up with Cloud 9 of the other teams above them to speakFarrakhan strong to hear it for a lost and smoothie this is the first non-ferrous game we have seen in the ALCS from Lost though it is worth mentioning as a coach I think our said last week hate we're going to pick verus for lost because he was a bit nervous and that is something that is going to give him conferences biggest Comfort pics oclg actually takes it away from him this time around and I think it's a strong picked individually and maybe even better by the fact they may be putting this guy off of his comfort him as well D Grace band the early pickup on the kitchen open pushing down a little bit before it can still be a top winner of course Bradenton going a lot of places but my money's still on it being dark so I totally agree and I think that because you're getting gamer trucks on your W-2 from the AP that you're building you can build more aggressively at the results at times I think it can be pretty powerful people always talk about displacement as one of the answers tohas Kendrick drop the ultimate Frank Askin all you out leasing to kick you out Jonica push you out those are champions that are considered very offensive drawing against it definitely agree it's we'll see if this can knock down candidates have definitely been a very strong Champions do for the nalc has to be rid of his first no sorry secrid Kindred game of the split personality join depression that again recently and now it's time to the second round picks and bans and look off the table not common champions in Poplar North America but these windows remove here I'll see if they're coming to goes away one final table and banter sealed boxes turn to pick right after that that would be a Jays player if matchup make sense I'm trying to think what is it that your son wants to play that he's worried about adjacent to Oslo even getting banned out here I mean I think makes some sense when you're looking for, The Knockout gragas with a knock up and cook you a middling could be going Top Lane so that it may be a bit of a read based on the pictures they've actually gone formaybe looking at Nar for something is the flight out of here Yahoo normally known as the counter to Nara thinking of like safe top of the dark song could play took his perennial or recover of course the option either way through the team will see what comes out alongside that those skills you must login a chance to win for rumble yet in LCS summer in the NLCS what is it played around the world and I don't play much more heavily and some of the other Regents play wlbk it elsewhere in the world can be very very strong and watch a match up so I think certainly should have the advantage here against the show gas but that being said to a certain point where you have so much Mr that in combination with your past that you can start a really just going to ignore the rumble and then I can start to look bad for them cuz walk is a guy and he has either you or run away actuallyLG with a ride compliment is one of the tanks spray back more effectively against Rumble because Rumble comes up the flame spitter you connect to be hitting them with kind of day are we on your vocal spikes and you know getting a lot of things so we'll see how who need pen play the out there much more squishy composition of Horicon presume kind of run here for Equifax but they are always more on the side of run higher damage compositions that are heart attacks you Don but have very high potential if you can hold them off at his death from Deca Fox style of play most played Fire Road Gangplank engraved for example of altomonte back on Spindrift his most played here as well and it is jungle gragas self echo-fox playing as you mentioned and aggressive line up a couplemeanwhile C LGA cho'gath and they send you feedback line alive and a rifle damage output pretty well-rounded hear Michael Phelps want to play Xbox loves the big fight around the map loves to try to go for a few aggressive diets in these sorts of things and Shane can be a strong answer to that Comcast when you think about somebody games have been played today Comcast standing behind a very strong against a minor marks been keeping him exceptionally safe this is going to be a very Earth without that sort of feel without that sort of state that they normally have still work on can be incredibly powerful in the engages there if you catch that fairest he may just die instantly statements going to be the name of the game for the echo Fox side clgi much more standard composition ryzen of himself not all that common anymore in North America in profly still is being some don't get me wronglast year we had seen before from him and we are on a summoner's rift here for this battle CLG just barely on the outside of plant position Echo fox jumps about a game and a half behind first-place and they can keep up with him liquored they can't I hundred thieves with the wind right here and it's another champion that does have that semi Global presence kind of answer fights around the map year for Magnavox if they want to go for this early skirmishes to interesting options here as far as that the matter is going to double cleanse were smoothie and Demonte and who the electric Andheri here on the road, and I think that is simply because he's up against the Shan someone who should have left lane presents and you driving that extra little bit of damage you have the Selfies you have the Eyrie this is a much more aggressive set up here from smoothies goony looking to have more Lane dominance with him this is not kouign-amann Guardian this is not coining and kind of more of us it back style build it so what we got here for ourselves right nowno face checked invades a host rent answer anyting worth also pointing out sticks day is going a crafting here as well right so this is the same thing that Cody sent did I he is, he's going to be going lethality I think this is really just saying hey I don't actually need the door inside of Mordor to go for that having the extra man is actually more effective and allows YouTuber have skip that Surly beer once again so I think they making a hundred these are likely screaming or that this is kind of popping up and in their circles as it's really the first time I've been seeing intro play this weekend as well right you'll and the E Crockett Bushnell at 7 to have damaged, lad mother 2040 something like that and he's got a little people down that way but for sure and not be biggest as far as follow up pokies going to be there for the all-in looks like overtime right now a pretty equal trade of farm these waves areI keep a favor for sealed you pushing so this is getting to first and you very rarely lose the potions I have a, not the case here and it does look like it The Relic fuel Charges going to be helping with that is looking much further ahead in the game when you think about poke it should be fairly because you ran for one more head pushing this way we never can go grab a Scuttle who needs to have to go to back to the base and use his TV also so super aggressive play here from CLD but it does reward them with a Scuttle a flash if you peeI want to see if I darshan can stay safe though because she is up and pee pee but he is down a flashing. Could come for return dang so or did he pee burn dies in only that refillable potion to look at the Middle Lane to Montefiore pushed up to he got $400 from CLD such a nice collapse the Shen comes up from Reign Over comes down on his Kindred there was no way out really bored to mate felt like he wanted fairly well there they just got caught completely off-guard by the three main collapsing do annotations profile frog following Demonte over that wall and then all the sudden rain over it's your although he is level 3 flash over the wall spray tan to Devonte and he is going to get run down keep playing exceptionally aggressive and use it all the flashes offensively getting a kill getting some pressure up on the top side but this has been coz strength if there has been one you know it hasn't the early game they've been non-stop getting first was really getting it into is there at the midden liking where they have struggled in Dover well yeah what was the kitchen sometimes nicely time and who need all the way in a loaf can't get that kind of jungle kill dad great job there from hunie you know kind of suspecting that ran over could be on those walls knowing he hadn't gone back yet he would be very low finds him guess a kill gets the Blue Dolphin going to be feeling pretty nice about that early Rome so again it's cracking what field from here there early game planning their early gameplays are almost always excellent they have some of the best kind of first 10 minutes I would say in the entire league and now I'll fight for the bodhisattva but still I help speak Deco Fox duo in the forces of the new look for their dueling just their third game together onstage they played together about 12 days now and that's all other than eBay nicely played who he put in his kit to work and get that smoothies here though they have to be careful sweetie has Flash The Flash going to land they could not do so knowing how close are talking rain over a great early start with in two back-to-back death steer him quite a bit and now it's only going on real can pierce the Heavens to do a lot of damage to avoid monster the top side as well might look at our dive soon enough for show guy who he waiting behind the wings and now. Yeah he really just want to give up this way if it's all it's a lot of gold to be had there especially with the Canon darshan now they'll have to back off he's not sick he has no TP but he's going to have to give up this way but probably for level leave for Echo Fox with from Demonte in the mid lane so I think that prompt Tackle Box to backup a v Notre Dame win the to be to they do not want that 3 V2 and shin up here on the top side jobs I don't know if they realize about boss is going to be here as well who he walks over very moody has its only go for it don't do frosted just everywhere this game 3 KP on a support check Free level six and none of them were in his lamp having a monster Libra formance in this gaming Pony getting too aggressive you has been getting punished for this to so heavily recently I'm not expecting the extra man to be there he loses his life Advantage nobody expects riverset it's been around for years but beautiful stuff in the back of a farm and a frequency ignite but this Farm comes through and honestly just impressed LG Duo top 5 ds you would not expect that when she has made three rooms away from that lane and you're a lady at the dryer work on one of the strongest early-game Elena and Duos in the game so very impressive stuff from them. I have a 6 o has flash Demonte assist as well they could look for flights going to win that is rough that was completely flashable gives the Kilauea three men did. They're going to go to play right field available as well put some some work but that is for sure going down Echoplex crap that 125 apiece for them to step forward if you need to reach out to the pain they can kill him if he does not he loses that. So good foods from the Xbox Squad winning out very heavily not only now have they gotten that skill and the CSF leak in the bottom Lane Bob Ross has been everywhere and lost only a pretty big mistake not being over the flats at max range parasol ruffstuff 500 gold deficit now I can Fox hoping to come back from scary stuff even the first to record has not made it to the fact that CLG are out farming in several places and up kills as well what's in a back-and-forth mount Drake on the table not the most important right now but might be worth scrapping over off its my throat at grab Scott on the bottom side and left-back in the two on two
