no his champion pool is it to him but it works out well when he plays in comfortable on and I do think that I still feel like Golden Gardens can easily be a player one of those things I could take that playoff spot from another We Are The Champions by Queen can see there's no yasso allowed on the golden Guardian side what they wanted and actually play for themselves and the following one of those places. She had done well on Mages in the previous split is going to be a flex khaki the night away and Haku is no on the threat to himself bottom Lane even if you want to consider yasso Bottom Line tickets at pleaded play yesterday and then to support fan create typical stuff in the first round of bands are coming out from Echo Fox and golden Guardians will see what they want to go with the auto did not work out for them at all yesterday definitely was really struggling on that and Oleg getting out of prison for kids play there on the horn as well but they worthvery weak bottom line to be too and I think they're going to want to try to go back to something and maybe a bit more standard after that game for us to build back up the comforter store got up and it doesn't even pick it right away you can see the April 4th mcfreckle plus I with Lucien off the table or that is easily and by far the most highly prized champion in Pro flight and definitely having a very strong Lenny face as well as picking up a lot of pressure and you can't do a lot of damage yeah it's also very strong go over to the dragon helped us secure that we know closer he's very good at figuring injective sandhow they actually perform on it a lot of kill threat in these Coastal and also if you can get an early combo and starts backing up those two fewer sure it can be hard to kill off as real Brom you shouldn't lovely in pressurized mention he can swing in the lane when her support rooms away you were always going to get closer when you want it goes to me right away looking like they want to count to pick somewhere else and now it's Jarvan grab for Echo Fox week. Darshan play that top really we know can also obviously be a jongleur for us as well so that remains flexible neck of bauxite Guardians think it makes sense when you are red side you're hoping you can often counterfeit both solos it with your first pick in the last around as well as going to pick right here so they are going to grab the yard. But as you said we don't actually know if that is the top or jungle pick for Solo or rush because every possible for the flag that are so ridiculously popular these daysexactly get to properly matchups because they don't yet know where it's going and popularity a lot and some of the other reasons as a top laner is being played as it seems like for in recent weeks in the toppling dead in Jungle but I think it really can work you to go Stephanie Green Owl Midland fan going through is Oriana until you're both off the table you're being dropped out as he is continuing to rise and rise in popularity certainly a strong top laner Yeah Toast the driving to be jungle then date Phillies on the band for Golden Guardians they don't want to deal with any potential Yorick a couple targeted take taken away here from frog and but certainly there is the Olivia still available know he still does have a lot of other pics that he is really enjoyed it so she would not necessarily brought on stage yet like the Veigar like the luck to be excited to see him bringing out more of these you need except I want to lock it into audience Ramen to be great but alright Gleason is going to be a for sure where the job is going standby. Jarvan is going to the Jungle Sion top to match or it's going to be exciting just kidding stop yeah we will see at what frog want to grab here might be getting interesting fact I think the Corky is not only a good wine pay for itself is when we get frog in last time you did the else gets was playing a lot to prove it take away is there from Phoenix that is a good source of magic damage here for the Xbox line and stuff they have a very strong feeling too buddy cop would you looking over at their side a lot of Frontline with Sion Jarvan and Brom and then double Mark than one and bring the Magic game at 1 bring the physical damage are they should be feeling pretty good about that and likewise with the picture locked in it really is kind of team fighting cops that we have going up against each other a lot of engaged here from the golden Guardian Sodom Lane as well as obviously the Flemington Central they're out of lease in and I think that we could see them trying to pressure down a lot around the bottom Lane where were they should have it earlier than I feel like in my mind I slightly saver echo-fox dear I like spy on stealing a lot like Jarvis killing for sure more than least bin zanni flag is a plan of attack speed and you got a little bit of energy to bring it out here record-wise they are slightly favored over golden Guardians compromise I like them as well that's good to give you that run a rush and his team to win on Sunday after a loss on Saturday imma call you guys are going to break that streak here and it would be pretty impressive do so as they are on their last five matches than they have to make it at least one to get in the playoffs we'll see if they're going to be able to do it for me a roster for the golden Guardian so they have been getting stronger they have been feeling like they're actually finding their legs in this LPS season is starting to live a little bit more up to expectations people saw them as a playoff game definitely can be still if you have a few more games to play and make sure you're logged in to watch. LoL Esports in game contest Washington class today and look at that even a lower Third Watch. LoL Esports., case I'm not making enough sense or yourself some in-game content adjust for tuning in frogging Puerto Rican LCS spring split week 5 30-second something is fun. Not much my baseball all right well we got them out from the two teams and I do think the golden Guardians should have you at least bushing Lane top bushing Lane bought and I think that midlane is is more of a kind of a coin flip there I could go either way depending on who I'm going to be able to get the advantage in the Early Trades but but either way that should give contracts the early Edge in the jungle when you have Lain priority and multiple Lanes you should be able to be more aggressive you should be able to have more opportunity to try to attack your body down in the jungle I think there is a chance that Phoenix is Corky actually does get a LAN party long-term over frog and Victor because he's running teleport you can go super ham the first three or four waves and and just just burn your entire Health in manifold to try to get frog on the back foot in his to be key back in place with me footwork I feel like it's the same through so I would not be surprised by level six. Phoenix police belt clip push to push leave their first Dumbledore have to wait to see you but timer for 10 minutes early hex core upgrade that e gives you so much way of clearing know maybe you just don't actually fight Phoenix on that quirky but either way we are going to have a rush starting down on the bottom side he was leashed contract is going to be starting topside we'll see if he goes into vertical jungling likely is here on the bottom side so it will be a little careful yeah both are going to be doing the schedule and then it definitely seems like they could be looking to try to take away if their opponents Blues but that's more dangerous for rush because of golden Guardians potentially has a Fortune bottom line that's true if they can get back on to him when he goes for this but right now it feels like it's actually a box of gotten the early priority in your sing Tennessee at the three types of minions being shoved in so I thought she not easy for a way to leave and go try to stop to do if you can tell him by the Vino at all and empty have to see as though working out they spend the resources to push in that's doing okay so these can be equally traded Camp so far this time as well what's lady Pastor one Seidel vintage the same camp Beach other Yuengling text scenarios how many cancel you actually go for you can see so far that contractors not actually started up the walls and Rush has contacted looking for a gang Midwest and there's no he'll sober without using priority for him as well so the wave can be frozen against him and he'd have a lot to be back in the rushes here to this will be a Scooby-Doo or Hopsin I go I have some damage Rusty's one more spell summer ideal needs one more better for the golden Guardians because Phoenix uses TP to get back to Lane there the lane is frozen against him first Blood went to his Lane at ponen really good exchange there for the golden Guardians and we should be able to see frog and having a pretty significant Advantage off of that this is just really smart stuff so they already forced him out and based on the way the position he had actually TV back at those really nice for project heat flashes over rush to hit confirm the Q Rush reaction flash to block the queue for Phoenix but was not able to do it in time do contracts helps to get that damage down and does pick it up will be the advantage in the jungle for rush but certainly the solo Advantage should be dragons and temporarily Rush has yet to recall so he's actually horse on out of the fight is gold leaves not going to matter of time is not PVP stats, regardless and either way then go back to farming but there's a double line for there is the lead if he finally gets that push through and not rush maybe try to find his receipt can you mind it's now summer list on both midlane Corky if he has natural escapes Victor does not a brush aim the EQ well he will for sure confirm CC in a frog in that picture can be killed especially if he is pushing to me have to watch for award I don't believe I saw a rush for the Russian word go down but now he's going to be potential to on one keep mine at Corky's not in the lane right now Sports Clips in Rainbow contract but now it's so low we going to push back monster in A1 vs to himself and has low but no gate coming through downtown right off that first game has ran straight over to Scuttle there and actually just takes out contracts broaden was busy trying to shop and the golden Guardian soul in his room. He was actually get over there and help out contracts and he gets taken down for a very easy kill hati actually been a bit more safe there look at it this yes lead already significant disadvantage for Phoenix going to get himself back into it a little bit more with that kill we are going to be fog in front of make good on his Advantage going down to the bottom Lane looking to punish slap nice entirely really nice the Midlands Orthopedics year it was still a pretty decent if you're going to be able to get the flash they're out of the follow the will get the teleport out here also and I definitely in ale should be able to get a decent reset the here is the play one more time of the interruption on the Warhawk there's a contract decides to just try to run back the other way towards his mid laner knowing that he could get the assistance there I've been as Russia's going up towards that lopsided in Phoenix wasn't actually tracked didn't realize that he could be here contract was thinking okay great we pushed out one guy in a frog is going to be able to come up I can grab this subtle but instead it isn't Ezekiel find a way of Phoenix it's just me and tries to grab this way it'll be 4252 everything will and he's going to get away from this one that's enough for the walk has to be stopped en Phoenix will drop one more time for 14 seconds later Apollo and hack modem in Land O Lakes does not have spells to more Autos it'll be a stunning this shirt kill a pencil and a cubit Contracting nearby cut pork chops come in and they will not save him only 600 thank you you're willing to make that trade as are you are putting that Corky down even more what is a great response from Jaco tping and being able to answer that getting to kill over onto his drill a special is going to feel good there and I can have no man I said they couldn't actually really fight back in that circumstances it's a good setup you can see that they're they're playing it very patiently await is not wasted, or lie on the gravity field is really well place you do the fortunate to have flashed so when that hits the Sun away is always going to be able to follow up they do get the kill but Apollo has made the Rome and the TP come inform hawkwell flash que hora llegas tag Providence out of mana and easy chase down for the tracheal wasted a lot of time in Casio Valkyrie the first time around you kind of let only get closer than I needed to do and maybe you would have loved to be passed out spell bit earlier either way though it's just a tour and now and Golden Garden go for a deep board or spot and get back out flu is traffic to Corky and we have a nicely he's got that augment and yeah it's an 800 goals lead a feeling released all he got through that way to get the first 2 augments on Victor and now he's just online when you got to get an upgraded is first base thanks to that first was certainly things are looking good for us we do see multiple members from both sides on this dragon head but he's not here yet they should just finished
