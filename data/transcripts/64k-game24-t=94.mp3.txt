CNET world did you ask a lot of people who your top four teams at Worlds would be it'll be top Esports gaming JT gaming and the baby G2 as number for wool suiting bg2 in the group stage lady gaming in the quarterfinals there currently beating top and they would win the final four of cups and they're part of the way already be true if they can get there I would put some brakes on this train that is rolling out of control here for suiting know because I do still believe top Esports is the more flexible team and I expect now that they actually get red side with both of these teams that hire with percentages are red side than blue side because of their preference for those counter picks especially for topside they will be able to make the adjustment we're not be ports are recognizing the main play that soon and go for are these mid-game team fightwhere is already formed up angel is already formed up and they're running off of there their Top Lane priority from din so if top Esports adjust accordingly get themselves a front-line get themselves stomach making team fight those making him fight with way better than AJ fix I think they'll be set up for a lot more success because at Jay's flying would definitely a little weird and probably was a regular here in the last draft yeah I would like to see maybe that's a sign that he played so well against fanatic a little while ago you're seeing the same that it's a lot of places as real answers jin-li belt is top Esports Have Nots Band Away Kindred is the champion that we have not seen parts of play all split we thought as to offend pick it up for world to produce all the on it feels like it's okay I've got other Champs in the pool maybe an AP jungle like Evelyn make more senseIsrael yeah definitely very comfortable for Jackie love is most played of the Year by far the Zoe and we're looking for last game is picked up so you do have rain for Ranger I like this for spooning when you have dim plus is Zoe a definite possibilities for those mid-game groupings you can get poked damage you can really easily fish for the stairs Zoe Bubbles and Jen W's are so easy to throw out with very low cost and get the reward is still high do actually find somebody with it so is there going to be the answer to do it before the last you know before you come through I should say night going to have her the options right now trying to figure out what he can do against his old team next year Nike came back and copies works out better and better and better to Oriana games in a row going to be his options here and navigate to see bands come through those teams have the exact same three roll andreally not a spicy pic into into Zoey Zoey with the out rain and out play possibilities on the Oriana orellana so much more utility and in Team by oriented to yourself Angel should be super comfortable on his Zoe as he always has been and will look at the support role for the Maine band because again that's where a lot of the playmaking is going to be sent we also already had Kindred at least been locked in for for the junglers they're still looking for some Frontline here and you mean has going to pick that you can just played a bit with the Ezra Hall 4% win rate in the LPL in for a champion with or at 18 with a 70% win rate going 3 + 3 is not as good so that what is a band because of the commons godparents still want to see if Leona is left available cuz that is more likely than not what actually come through and waiting to see those that is going to be the case as they do still want a bit more in which wouldn't be bad to join the Oriana and Lease in the way and Vladimir innocently being banned away on the soonest I Could Have Lied by to make sense it's an appointment for been because Vladimir super good pic into Gangplank if if they went with your name I believe Forbidden Lover I think you have a high probability with a Vladimir band that they do go with the Gangplank though so it is going to be the Resort in quite some time here for Ben they are really doing down there are almost predicting the adjustment of the yes I feel like and and they want to have the ones with the team fight the guaranteed log engaged start up here and since you're already looking at the Leona picking their supposed fourth the fourth the other biggest counter to Orono of the Bronx for the team fight later can't get picked up so I do like it there they kind of jumped the gun and they said they take the arm first only to have Gangplank answered on the other side has expected here for 369 there so it is going to be counterfeit Copper Top Esports every single time so far this series we are seeing Top Lane pick last of the red side makes you know your match up and then try to make it look good that once again it's still physical damage Jungle Top on the TV yes I'd been can fairly easily do armor stacking and he's not done in the first level of pretty good with Sunfire cape and ninja tabi looks like yeah that would definitely say this how about we are going to be playing off of this Leona so Gangplank ultimate is what he has over the orange for the early stages for that Global and you want to use that to follow around Liliana this puts a lot of emphasis on the playmaking for your support because the owners so good at roaming around you can eat a set up a place in bottom side and have that Haley combination or you can just use the Gangplank ultimate on the support Trump linking up with the jungle all right to do it all now if he comes through the Champs are locked in the lineups are there any time for. Being forced to find their way back into the Sears we are on for game two of our second semi-final of world twenty20 one of these Teasley representing their home country for the three piece of the LPL at the world championship and the chance to win worlds on home soil for the first time since 2014 car says being invaded upon and I don't believe they know because right now they know he saw the journey in Carson what are the things that animals that did touch on at the beginning of the top of the day though where the level ones that have been so standard 40s and that magical journey rewards soon with a deep Ward and nothing more counter wart on bottom side though this is your standard reaction anytime you do sniff out that invade thank you observers you point out the word here as Dracula was the one to actually walk deep into enemy Territory news his drink it first thing is you don't actually know for sure if you will recall the way just yet until you see them on the ward you're not sure what Sword Art and everyone else were up to but not a spotted as they go for Li Shang and it's going to be okay car so I can walk up and take his Red Bluff year music. Of course spots Bend I'm going to be safe with Red Bluff leashless starts on both sides by the way is barred wants to learn q and W in the first two men even three levels do points he was not that uncommon just going to really really hurt early Lane pressure sore. Has only Auto tax in passive for early Lane pressure exhaust already burned out a jackulate we can't Auto quite as hard and back a little bit but you know honestly not so bad this already burned on players here I think both lung Fung and sorta had to pop that but he's a bad deal on Summoner spells special in the bottom line free are you are you buying buying an erection for the level to you see how they're kind of crowd the minions right now yes soothing are basset backing off they they cede control they've lost the the war over the damage on minions and that is to be expected as you talked about when you do start the magical journey early there is a price that you're paying you either lose out on that lane pressure or you lose out on with a lot of bars used to do is leave your health facts around for Mid laners for the for the solo Lane impact junglers actually this time of course I'm making some sneaky moves as he gets around for a possible look towards men I think it was looking for a raptor counter still here maybe that's what I was going on but wasn't so basically I'm moving on how we know. I can still smell away is not going to be clearing exact same exact same side as what time did last game as well for the full six yes indeed plenty of damage to go to sort out the Atlantic you not go Journeys away that could be helpful and Jackie love is on the wrong side and that's what time is right behind him where are the teleport or else got to come down when can you get away flashes across everybody to run away for this one they will live but it burns so many resources those are big cooldowns yes the only discrepancy here in favor of toffees or would be the teleport that night hold on to you as Angel tries to make that trap come complete on the bottom side with sofm walking down through the jungle it. They had the fully collapsed upon in their reward yes bottom side for top Esports now have to play a lot more defensively near the ones going all their flashes first Kinder Mark is topside right now and no one's around I can test this one so we're not sure if I told him yet can guarantee that can did Mark but doesn't hurt to wash for 369 pushed in early on has not taken the first three call yet going to do so right about now try to finish enso FM with mid controls going to have no problems here at all Candor market number one going to come through and we'll do our best to keep track over the course of time ends to get the first Mark of the first set of skulls then the next three you can get off the shallow Camp of the Raptors or Grump or scuttles and then where you get your giant 75 in an increase into your range then you have to go deeper in to the deepest Pond camps the Frog and The Wolves or bus so easy early ones to pick up let's see if they actually turn their site where's the early Dragon do with the change that we've seen the bottom Lane standing fear since we open up the game talking about Gangplank ultimate and the big reason here for the Pick-4 3694 top Esports is it try and play ho ho he actually split them doesn't stop you do recall there regardless of the big reason to pick that can click is is for that ultimate and the possibility of playing off your Leona pressure why do that kind of relieved by soon and going aggressive getting some of those flashes down on the side of to yes possibilities are still definitely there though you know store. Offensively bone bone faster can also be punished just as easily as a defense that we going on a free summer hill going to mean to that poke did nothing to Angel and have no problem with this one Drake has spawned now 5 and 1/2 minute then sooning small gold leaves so far Northwest Play Again Play does print a bit of free money stacking up as time goes on aggressive Ward comes down they know they're not spotted hoping for an interesting play is someone going to run to the Jungle not just yet so dark walking back normally Swifty's rush comes through for one fun no surprise there Jackie love making the right choice and building the pickaxe half of mad-eye Moody I think to your by itself is actually a really liked our Trump speaking of which that's what night has Midlands Hospital what's especially if you are trying to play off of you know there's a possibility of bottom side plays you'd rather have that no damage right now it is about to be level six that you go for 369 and he even took the extra fairy charm in inventory along with the sheen to make sure he's going to have enough Mana to try and use the ultimate for that bottom side play I would say that soon should be looking for this also though as much as top Esports you know trying to plan around it you should always be looking at the wind condition for your opponents should be pretty easy to get the small Bart spa parts the chicken but the the market self was taken away cars it took to camp in time at what time should have bought three tickets to late and it will remain only one mark on the Kindred buckets to fight over the red UNG I going to be spotted out by and I scrap one song yep he's a guy can last you to see you right now outside steps as well no problem in our flight in the midst I want to change his real flash to do so but stays alive Garcia's first game results and it's coming to spell going away and now as well finish was the midline night haste and walks out not going to hurt too much to deal damage to them exhaust also used for stacking up these cool dance that are being burned around this Dragon area I'm kind of waiting for it to open up here with with pops plan to try and see if they do for Saint an early Dragon if we get to reset off your first to try and buy them from going to be call stop enforcing know exactly where he is cuz you can tell that connected it looks a little different so he knows it's going on down there then finish up with the way at 4 the cheapest is already in the time to cook top is pretty much passed yes it's possible but the senator of resources is getting really high special but even the counter punch to take a break so seems like he's going to be on the island for a while over the top side but then again you mentioned it before it's why you put gangplanks you can eat somewhere else and play around that Leona and have that happen somewhere else so the waiting for that top Esports player on bottom side to thing if we consider this plant as well because not getting his Blue Book now plus the tear that you mention him starting with Oriana really focuses on just pushing that way of trying to make sure Zoe doesn't get the wrong around for bubbles sofm a nice hop over the back of this Dragon he's going to take that objective before they even get a chance even if it's total crap there and you see the pings and they support room already to the topside for are you on it looks like it's going to be top Esports as soon as I hear the dragon roar will immediately try and answer with the early topside you can do it the herald is a lie but maybe be able to get there is a defendant cancel. O clock to buy for hello I picked up some time to run a fast don't worry about it a couple of caretaker shrines for Angel make sure he's going to feel okay is down in CS and then parsley and he's going to try but that water's going to the fact that we know it was at least leashed Now cars is not going to follow in so theoretically now that they want to go away then what's going on and will see you soon and go to play with very much that's what I'm pretty easily sustain himself knock you down Canton Kindred can very easily could have to tell David to so interesting exchange of information they thought I saw a friend walk over towards Grand so they're going to actually start off the rip drill but the word still is there and sword Arts coming so soon not getting away that they know that's one of the biggest things you don't want to use your movements too early to alert them Forte
