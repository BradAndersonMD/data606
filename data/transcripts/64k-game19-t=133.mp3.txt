how much more manageable upon it and golden Guardians Champion across top reason so far dispatch most pick the band overall 90% number one in Pro play so no big deal Pantheon outstanding rules right now I'm sure as well but support so easy ban there as well and we can finish Jet-Dry guess is someone who has popped up a lot in the medit to but it's more for top light which is kind of thing I've been seeing a lot of toppling gragas around the world these days. So that pic also pretty high in priority and math a lot of people are really loving other kind of comment build where you can just poke away with Ian, very dominant and Lane just with all those guaranteed poking her ass that you can landed obviously very powerful team fight with theultimate I'm so pretty high priority on I'm really all of these campion's I do feel like the later bands are more where it's kind of just up to you what you are most worried about is it something specifically from the opposing team college is one of those band champions in the world though I was checking you know a day or two ago on actual battery that it had one picking Pro Flay and something like 4849 vans so this is not really getting through another regions pretty much at all seals you will be given it it is potentially flexible mostly it is still played in Midland from what I see you in solo queue but obviously can't go to topI'll see what comes through regardless of course in the European piano Loft and lie there good band as well as he got to choose there are lots of good Champion right like 40 something very very very strong and did you got to figure out which one's going to play games with once you are not Kaiser Graves is also what they bargained with said okay you might lock in the colony but that gives us first flash on a bot Lane first glance at it at 8 on here as well as a gym rat came through and of course very straight talk to her as well or really affect American up and stop playing so it only made things even more likely has been outstanding hand so much trouble in killing tanks and we'll see those to get locked in at some point for gold yeah exactly you know that they may go towards that but he always see have a lot of squishy campion's in his first round picks year for Golden Gardens at gin can look towards engine does have absolutelywilber's especially when you are playing from ahead it could be pretty difficult to deal with the gym 21 season itemization setting has really helped Jen especially things like The Collector that are offering both credit and lethality which gin just absolutely loves a has made I think a pretty big difference gale-force can help with some of the mobility issues that Jen has a line to chase down and get that for shot off in a situation that you might not have otherwise been able to and I also feel like you know when your parents in with other heavy for him is like the akali energy there because they both have pretty heavy out front damage that can help to move towards in that fourth shot excuse to call ER to execute will see if they're gonna be able to pull off this sort of style of fighting because I do think that it is more difficult than your standard front to back couple tanks in the front line is this is kind of more skirmishes you were looking for flanks and we'll see if they do bring in some engage from the jungle and before to try to make starting price will be easieryeah we did see a little while back there with his impact on Evil Geniuses doing a really good job having the Renekton plank to be the primary in gate and that was enough but I really have to get in there and think we were in the medicane wherever in love playing things like Leona Alistair and Ralph are you expecting to get in at some point to Leah and Italy the bands by the way on the golden Guardian side expecting toppling to be a focus get rid of the most common magic Damage Done Rouge that would complement connecting very well meanwhile Niles he's a Giza carry play do you want to play something slow to respond and so Gangplank is going to be a lock it that you can ignore gameplay but can you still there to be a damage dealer and he is still there to do I participate you know it on that site and still have no front line and a really good idea so far for the engage I'm expecting that will get some sort of report for their last pick is what I would assume and then you can have set up swear to me you dropped a GP Altman on them your support goes for try to look for some sort of engaged are in a GP also you can answer the Renekton Point Quick Stopno orange out of that hopefully avoid any sort of combo from the jungler that we've been seeing if it's in a lot of an act in Tulia Ivermectin did Ali was very popular last year these has accomplished can be pretty frightening but said you want to give me coming in sociology composition with more Frontline how this does give them some engaged as well obviously the stage 1 alternate can sometimes be a bit unreliable but you know that he's very reliable can be sometimes nicer to use that text when you open it as a follow-up out of her methods that are out of the initial engaged up from the house so I can guarantee that it's not going to be dashed out of avoided new with something like a case of ultimate to round things out for CLG but they're relatively short-range Steve over all this is a team that wants to fight that wants us grab five different angles to get those engages and really knocked down golden Guardian to her looking to draft something that they feel a lot more kite and it with the galley or coming in your galio is more follow-up engage or counter and Gagethen he is at the primary in case I guess you can flag and try to talk but you can just get headbutt out by the Alistar that's not as reliable as something like a Leona or or even the Alex are himself so Golden Gardens it feels more like they're going to be trying too tight and disengage from Sea algae and try to win that longer extended fight going to play the map is openly as they can for them are Kaiser in a Galileo can get in from pretty far away Odyssey GP old from anywhere on the map PDF as most men trained as well so you're right that conventional gauge is going to be tough you can t f into the back line with Kaylee over top and that can kind of work but that's not really the look it feels like a a split push every team the problem is who's going to answer connected pretty well because off of ruined King PlusGorge maker like it's going to it's going to be tough to win the what do you want I feel like as GP but we'll see how it goes we'll see what the hell does it look like here for Golden Guardian as if they are rosters going to have their first game of the year and 6 in his first day of off of CLG likely saw his old teammates lose to Team Liquid not long ago since it's a bunch of groups of the five teams to look at a play twice in a five-game day it is sealed restaurant the day someone else will do it tomorrow and now look at to see what these players can show for us CLG lost to the best team in the league likely every other team elusive TL as well this one is timer supposed to shake back up and take down gold Guardians if they want to keep themselves happy and I think the answer you know as to who's going to answer the Renekton it is just going to be probably Niles but not necessarily trying to fight him or kill him just try to wave clear right now we can see Golden Gardens looking for a potential late invade I may be just going to go toward down here from nuviva decided his back it up I'm not even going to go for that because he wants toget to a certain point as long as you're not getting Dover you're way behind your wave hair becomes very very effective and it can be difficult to dive GP from that situation especially if he does go for a little bit more and he build a bit more of a defensive build early on sometimes we will see people you know just do things like picking up a little bit of HP Lewis and Ruby crystals and things are really on to it to make sure that they're not just going to get completely obliterated in a diving if I'll can do that hold on there I've been there's the possibility of a blaze Olive playing the other side of the map as you said get out until at 131 have new be responding to both sides potential ETF as well as that Galileo coming in and trying to pick on those side lanes and maybe getting out of bedthat's all talk cannot catch the second wave of the Guardians been get pretty reliably so you got the back up pretty soon because we can walk at you you forward and then go for the tonsils supposed to play out of rain for their safe against that you can see audio tour is is that rain so there I believe might have to drop one Cs and the day is not going to be a big deal at Blaze all look at the early push and it gets pulled out there cuz I can't walk Centex auto back as wellnot too bad I'm going to be pretty into the sea where pobelter takes us as well as far as itemization does go the more common build is the wrif maker but I feel like my Harvester is often more effective as if you are having those long extended flights to sustain from The Ref maker can be pretty powerful you do see people tearing that up a lot of times with something like demonic Embrace in Spanish this warlike pseudocyst a knee Tanki longer fight style but I tend to feel like when I see people just going night Harvester and you didn't Lich Bane in the more aggressive Versi style of bills those can be really really powerful and especially against a lot of squishy members over on Golden Guardians I tend to feel like that would make more sense this gameyeah I'm actually a big fan of ours are they get so incredibly underrated Mage Mythic even even so far as to say you don't have to go to lose every game you can just go to my Harvester Rangers manager Amanda better and you know we are sooner and I could be released want me to go about things also nice in the season is Lich Bane Batman on it so you could feel a lot better but I don't feel like you're wasting money on you know exist on that recipe anymore Guardians a very small gold lead over all the squats without just Twisted Fate and Gangplank exist so doesn't really mean much just yet equally likely to be up there but not doing too much overall freighter blows across the 80 carries you could see that they're all trying to stay far away from the gate before the tanks in the brush to make sure you're out of range of their stuff to make a little bit about those kind of non man items in one of the Champions that we do see actually going for a 9mm an item a lot of time is tftf off and going for the hextech rocket belt you just helping4th utility the engagement all the dashboard perhaps land that gold card little bit more easily easily with the additional many get back from Luke Harding you don't always need more of that place. We're looking to push and reset constantly anyway so you don't always need the additional to stain from a lost chapter a style of item so we'll be cool to see where I played all of does go you can also go for inmate Harvester in those is heavy first style of build on PS4 Pro play I don't really think we'll see it and even so look you it's a lot less commonI'm going to go see golden Guardians do a lane to take me a second to see 6 a.m. and not say CLG so if you excuse me if I get that wrong when I once or twice this game I'm going to be a little bit so the backside of a canal fight match up against the best top laner that's ever spoken English maybe to be clear to shove it away because it take a very aggressive recalled because of it tracks the graves knows he's far takes the way between the two rights and get to walk back that's always a good feeling need to walk back to Lane about missing a speedswitch to another small gold lead to Golden Gardens Ablaze all of teepees. There's like I saw the way over as well but their spots it no place okay in the end still pretty darn good for Golden Guardians they end up getting the trait of teepees it is first Blood just barely going over 6/8 not going to get those who will be able to pick up that way then I'm on the top side miles is going to farming away here now looking to poke but the all intestine coming from Orange is the Pharaoh could mean a lot that was supposed to walk awaystop playing he's going to find Solo solo showing up big it looks like you messed up in a slice and dice again we see a blaze on popping the all that you're picking on no Renekton is gone but with that ultimate up he is very tanky and he's able to just stay alive they're turning around and killing off Niles who went to bar hopping the infamous solo about their that's his favorite for sure the camping icon really nice place for him to come to your land of fight what was Camp I mean really just this but what if you want to find a cap at 6 Ace going back to his tell me a ghost startthat's the thing you learn about League of Legends never a fair fight you know these people are always calling their junk there is over, mid laners whatever happened to an audible game of League of Legends beautiful soaps it going to Gold Leaf not bad for CLG ocean Drake claimed as well look who's the mythical Beast takes down Dragon parent Lisa Hart County who would have known but it's nice to see it or get them in early okay look you got to have the starter I've only got so many options to cash Griffin you on the I respected I respect it thanks no problem all right it was pretty important topside honestly because you do fall behind you pee in a melee matchup you can't get a fused back down to that for earlier play here smoothie looking for The Flash in Punjabi with the early flash get out on the other side in the middlehot out there but iconic was passing down and now back to live your up on the top side so little trouble here yeah he missed the barrel to have a smoothie nearby as well water debate it might go to find that but there's some nice honey proof stop playing so we're going to feel comfortable enough still has his 10c asleep still has his Kilt can we doing just fine up there is a griffin takes down a blue
