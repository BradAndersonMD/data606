and trying to set them up for more success but it's not what he's been through the gate Champions if you keep going down the list might be want to throw like echo or or rise or something in there EG have the Bandit Twisted Fate themselves which is one of these flip pushing options always like to keep open someone three-run possibilities for later in the game and their ability to play Sidelines as a as an Avenue for victoryand see what comes through I think the bands can open up very quickly cure a Zorn gets off the table trying to get rid of Tanks here for days we know Kumo has been a very good early in toddler he's one of the most improved player split Davis parish and Academy obviously at least we saw that game yesterday was not very good thing. You're just what I think it's a good choice there is well but yeah I think there is a lot of room can be a very thing left up more and more over off their through be going away from the Azrael combo with basil suppose play Champion to split so we're seeing a lot of like I like it Target band that sings U players are showing that they play at that and I want to see if we are going to follow it up with is it is it going to be more of the open up there you go it's just the karma kind of take away some of this before its speed and shielding geology they have had priority on Jungle picks for weekly in the pastkoala bears a great Flex big does ridiculously strong this is still 1013 by the way so hasn't even gotten the attack Speed Turf yet and we just completely it does so much that you never have to reveal if it's going a top or jungle until the very end of your Champion Select provide reliable tank that's in CC no matter where it goes and it does allow the opportunity for somebody grab the most picked jungler of both Wiggly and Spence Darren and buy more than I should say the v-neck camp in the pool so I'll actually locked in here just to guarantee it is clearly Comfort Revolt side and look it up bigly I went and do too much of a stats last week in ready for this game really is arguably the most selfless jungle in the LCS he has absolutely Rock Bottom Cas chair at 50 minutes and Beyond he can have a ton of farm and just as look y'all take my camps get your golden come up on football throw a stick say I will you know do something else like the weatherhave been probably above-average CS year and I went looked at Rouen he's also I'm coming from a high against monster trying to get out to the late early dinner will be the first one to lock in the mid laner for our midlane featured matchup lining the year and the hover already I like it Ford azuki looks like the echo locked in here this is one of the Champions iconic campus kind of mentioned at the very beginning that you associate with him trying to have a sassy Nation all in Kill predator on the mid-light match up and having options for playing side length later on yeah I dig this may just ask him if it gets really is forte and it looks really good here we got his birth Vlog games but yesterday going to get it for a second game of this place the day I love seeing players play the champion at Styles they are good ata big fan I want to see him take over face love seeing that overall meanwhile pobelter to be his first as your game of this but he is what a big bear tooth filled with quite good yesterday couldn't have to win but teleport fly away though we are into Kobe you talk about why an aggressive bottling for sale do the Kapil reply calypte is locked in that could definitely be there and I'm curious what we can see how to seal team do with a Cutlass the ultimate maybe we ccog boxing on like Nautilus or something for Smoothie it's something that he is used a lot for Point click initiation for the team and helps out so much with your volibear trying to find those in cages where you step in front of people if you can have the Nautilus Plus Calista combo that is just tremendous amount of Cece and connectorshinder the Play Making of echo later into the game as well yeah it make you second-guess how early you you want to use your ultimate cuz the whole play pattern for him is to Decay trying to dive bomb into the back line and get your your full combo off onto back on either is here or Calista before getting locked out if you get hit with all these different forms of species it's going to really reduce that picks value and kind of force him to play sideline only well if you're going to be easy not go for takeaway here they're going for the simple prom to protect back line without that has really need the help of any of the weather lets you get some very safe Frontline here to block things off and CLG can move around to locking in the morgue well absolutely destroys Robin the match up even if you fail to black black shield the stun it's impossible to screw up at any realistic scenario Slaughter what you wantyou completely sealed you should have walked over the bottom line and bake Point comes through as a blind picked off later actually like this game because your matchup but you already know that the enemy jungle is trundle and it's not the best at Tower diving early on so I actually think they should be okay regardless of what baby. Freak this is how we got to Chase Bank to the covers basic na dog with the Riven bring it back. I mean honestly I just been picking a chocolate blah blah blah I think about killing the Gangplank early on trying to chop him.so I actually do want to see spend staring problem in up there what are the stats with both of these teams is at both smoothie and Zazzle are number two and number three in Duo proximity so the supports room very little for both of these teams are both of them are above 75% of the first 15 minutes spent with their Lane Partners so it's much more on just the jungle influencing those matchups and if you can split the matchup Riven vs. Gangplank allow Kumo to actually make use of this counterpick and Elevate him this is going to be one of the few times Wetmore one of the teams again puts their top winner in the spotlight and really tries to play off that counter pick for red side well top it was a lot of the reason why they would impact took over that one on Chene as a kind of pic into now we get the ribbon-cutter pic into Gangplank and I'll see if they can replicate that success of a second-place team team liquidwhat is nclb the middle of pack right here at 5 and 5 going to have to put to go last time around but I want to see how much higher this team can go I do have hope for the squad e g mean while hoping to rekindle That Glory from Spring and whatever skills you have to get there alright super excited see we get a riveted ALCS and it's actually not at the hands of Viper it's in the hands of another one of the younger players going to keep a quick eye on that both junglers look like they are going to start on the bottom side so like ice and think it is going to be on them to influence the matchup fence Karen trundle very easy top to bottom to top side clear volunteers should win the fight over Scuttle crab and so it means that we can get there a little bit quicker and depends on the shove I would assume I was here as soon as the weather gets a level two level one is here doesn't get much of gold level two should be fine on keeping pressure on does UK and help Wiggly in establishing control over the top Lane the other things are seeing the jungle is here right try to kite the cancer to make scampi sauce Spencer and backed up in autos for Instagram the movement to that it saves one second and I can't there's no downside. But you're not slow you just ate it once I found the clear has a bit later flight back and forth to do cake it's a good sucking a pole vaulter and they took their supposed to rain pretty effectively they're pulled out there as you can tell what kind of focus on the minions of get the shove which is Yuki gets another proc off and I got to point out that she has way more sustaining Pope does to regular health potions is 3 and 1/2 back three sacks of corrupting is more Paducah and just like just turns through his health and Mana punch to go and look at it would be a kill already hope I have to recall early in this Lane and we're highlighting exactly why this is a signature champion at 4 to zukey he has the killer mentality electrocute Echo continually looking in for the trades get to the triple crock on the passive been staring though he's actually rushing instead of going to the Scuttle crab going for the cake with a big minion wave Taylor good slow a lot of damage knock up day is finally flashes but they're going to have an update with Red Sox the shop is on his first Blood path right top side and already top difference record head right up there for Kubo and set him up right we clean out a surprise get a son get some damage buddy I got the assists per day is one sin for a q that does nothing to build up their of the the Epic Odyssey of the river Fight 3 topside starts out with a little surprised boo let's get to know each rate after the Red Bluff into the game got two days now they went straight past this big can a minion wave pillar really nicely place they get the flies out of days and you still able to chase him down feed benefits of ribbon there with all the mobility in the champion and getting the killed in to Kuma's hand is so big and then continuing to try and punish the Gangplank big kill going to go over this Lane is pretty doomed Christine what end in an obvious counterpick match up where they need to cap it and they have the possibilities here to straight out of champ select Spence Karen repeat gang stuff that you saw how close it was with days being able to use that they kill on low health and firing back if if there is more pressure up there if there is Capricorn possibility your maybe they could actually turn that one around but with who does SNAP teleport down and cold start for Dave's he is really hurting yeah I will say this is not too bad current level difference that actually sequel for now as well I'm sure there's an XP Dell that we don't see it yet and levels themselves because tuba has almost always down please fight as well just pushed enforces to Ricky's off and losing Pharma to go to the fight it's obviously worth it but he is not bothering him as hard as you might expect those pills because the CF is getting dropped disposal also weekly technically at level leave there because he had counter juggled on the bottom side but Dragon picked up by ET in answer here so they'll be super happy with the infernal bonus stats nice little fruits there for the early stages of the game and since Karen has all the rest of the little chance to go back through and clear Wiggly only took away the ground but we're going to go down to the Atlanta Zoo Kay ultimate leaks but how exciting the early fighting has been at 4:30 back to lay with the boots of speed him keep up in farmed is it okay going to make his own recall on TV back in with some extra items himself so there will be a momentary I put farmwise these two players are pretty much neck-and-neck and he's going to get a window to move now as well these these 30-second Windows where you get to force a recall and and have priority over roaming from mid are so big you see pulled up they're actually canceled his recall he was trying to get off a second recall their clutches UK continually keeping up the pressure you just goes through these trades over and over continually honking out pulled out there keeping the pressure up in midlane even though the Cs is even it is Zhu Zhu que constantly forcing on him all right before your wave a slow pushing away from you there is fog of war in the river here comes the hard and Gage Miller is on Jesus how's the Way to the Top lyrics Stay Alive right I mean junglers down there there's a good roaming down there CLG know they're strong side of map would be bottom side and e g to sending all resources constantly camping the top side and camping this Gangplank CLG they take away the blue buff so there's some sort of answer but it looks like it's going to stop at that they don't wants to defend the crop available for weight loss uw's but not lose the Grump over to get to take that feels but yeah I'm a little sad that the counter play is what time does XP on speed on quickly but the game status fill 1000 up for EG in the Blues have traded back anyway maybe with a teepee up a topside it really wasn't tenable but I feel like maybe should have been dope enough to put him off the tour get the plates or something I mean it's really cool to see easy putting so many resources and so much faith in their youngest player
