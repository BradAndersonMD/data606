I fell because this is going to come down to it now so much pressure on the side of Tes side has been highly prized topside counter fix the name of the game freak let's see where we going to get into this time around see if we do have the orange showing up in the band again if we are going to have to carry carry match up because Ben's already shown that he's very willing to play play the tank for Forest if they if they are going to leave it up and if you're in a situation where 369 is basically guaranteed be able to get counterpick unread Lucian Spenser band keeps coming through Camille band keeps coming through and not one Cars wants to play here and we'll see what else comes out of the band Faith it's really not been the name of the game here it's it's been hot focused every single time and its outer pick has mattered getting the early blank tank hasn't been enough we saw the old LPL stand by I went looked at what are the top winners that are played in the lp on Bluetoothpause between reps was not good enough over in game 3 so you got to find something else last time someone was on Blue it was Orrin that wasn't enough either I want to see what can happen though champion of all time in the semifinals in the lp LP 690 Quinn into it and they also got to have that in the back of their minds when they considering Visa blind pick fee is beer actually taken out away from Angel cell signaling maybe more of the Oriana priority that the night has had for most of the day.I'll see what I can get out of this one are we going to see you since the first games anymore at least it had been so highly prized and you got to Talking Stick what you wanted as real as I saw the first time around but you got still a lot left open the Orion has been contested back and forth as well stop playing the most played five grapes and Selena the series that we're finally back on to it now through but Jack is Elmo's phone is almost as well as the gym priority before last game what kind of dropped off at and they've got the option here to pick it up for Jackie love let the Leona asriel's that's such a great combination with the offensive capabilities and wants on his door guard plate aggressively going for the burning flash go down by themselves earning kills for themselves in the bottom side of the mapit really did just pick them out completely different story for tonight I want to see if I get more of a dive comp together what's going to come through you can't really pick a top limit in Connecticut in test it with bands are going to go for a car and Angel for world has not played in the elf and actually threw it away the kind of Sauron kind of expecting here but not in the way that we thought it was going to is actually 369 and yes that Blind Pig for the topside they got both their solo laners locked in so early here also kind of ducks protected in before because when I opened up an entity very easy target for Gangplank that could be another one of the things they may be trying to protect here trying to get more safety for the bottom side of the map put more into Jackie love for these play I've been a super strong Jen and they started out the series that way you'll understand that top before it's actually blinded both solo Lanes in this game or janica answered by a collie bands to cover or that helps of course quite a bit but it means alot to fix are going to be going to throw a bit more and then we'll see if Fortune been on the side of a of jackeylove he's he's really being kind of beer on the 80 karrie roll Lulu as you want to keep playing at World Lulu was a new pick up for the world and it would go really nicely with our five-on-five set up that they have right now you have Oriana orange scaling for those team fights later with Graves Ash and if you supplement that with Lulu Port that is a tremendous five-on-five set up meanwhile soon it's going to be a collie early they do have the Assassin blocked in they're going to have to play a much more spread out style looking for those killed in the Jax beer once again at forbidden into the orange tank on the top side now Wednesday is very good against the weather if they are both been going to kill the backline make it pretty easy but there is still a lot diving in over the top as it is still a very heavy. Felix so important at the beginning of the day that's a really prioritize counter engaged in a lot of their situation for picking up that X Games to add that Biff disengage from oleona that will collapse on you you do have especially when some kids get to level 11 need to get the Rings to win the ultimate and you get that extra range with it it does give you some sort of mean for traversing the map and trying to deal with some of the split Style game that you're going to face when you're facing a team that's running in a colleague act as their double solo aunt all right final thoughts out of the coaches Do Or Dye for top Esports ever managed to win game 2 but they've still got to win back-to-back games to stay alive at world deep breath near freaked out it's just best of ones you have to visualize from this point on for talk to use for one game at a time there are the LPL Champions they want to be the world champion in a lot is riding on their shoulders mean while spooning knows they're about to have the eyes of a Nation on them they are the knockdown top Esports and be the last LPL representative left and it'll be on suiting then the team to have the LPL 3p the LPL era of taking the trophy and we are back to the Korean teams on top was either going to happen here. These words can they win two straight for does tuning close it out in game four or game 5 the order comes through they put a lot of faith on Jackie loves to be a big Carry On The Ash Tom Kankakee the back line state through been either carry top winner he gets counter pick against the orange crabs the Jax has a Jarvan the may be upset that match of even further we are out of the wreck it is such a fortuitous start for been because of the early attempted gang by Garza and the jungle invade follow-up is FM saying about for that died all these early kills the early money the wave control setup to view will bounce back that minion wave all really set up Jack to become the monster that he was this time around you can't be expecting that same repeat of the start but for suiting they've got their eyes on the prize and if you are the team from the LPL you take out the number one and number two seed there is so much riding on your shoulders with great power comes great responsibility and they will don't have to deliver Ward sweep does come through to take out the early vision and they're actually pulling with the Leona Azrael laying a lot of times with the Israel not to pull so that you can actually get some Dominion wave so you don't get pushed in early on yep not going to the case of Summer on do they will happily go to Lane late meanwhile Carson solos his Red Bluff take the chickens pretty well as well always important from a long-range units there as you fight that Raptor Camp Topolino's back and forth But Bundt gets grasp and level 2 first will come to Ben and that will be his something to play around I think there's a very easy interaction for the Jax counter strike when he went 369 cast Bellows breath you wait till it's done you start Counter-Strike and you will Dodge every possible attempt to break the brutal Sun have to go plus a little something for the Bellas wrap it actually only applies brittle on the end of the poop when he spits out the last little bit so Champions that have Mobility like Jack sent you can actually Dodge out as long as you need to get hit with the beginning of the Bells breath if you dodge the last bit you don't get the griddle hard they are found going to be here he does not have much more to for one so far and they want more send them back home 321 who has gone well it looks like another fortuitous start break of everything 1002 gold lead for suiting 3 and 1/2 minutes into the game of bottom Lane gang from sofm on the jarvin what a clear from him get sitting there is able to force out the flash from you make sure that you far away from Jackie Levin jackulate didn't Flash the EQ from Darvin here so autotempest changes targets he goes right on Jackie love note from him and usually heal what's that is sore. Follows up stand up and he is dead now they've got a number to Advantage if they decide decide to match your teleport and this is going to mean again so much for the game plan going from their tries to fly from front of car so I'm just trying to block the auto attacks from graves if you can't get behind them but what it really means is a random vacation for the bottom Lane once again the Ezreal Leona Lane gets the place so aggressively hear some of the Spells were burned yes jackeylove saved his flashing went down but it's the two kills to be as real for your super early tea or so he's going to be stacking up very quickly should go for the more scaling off because if I'm if I'm Jackal if you're okay you're not just going to get electric eels more damage we'll just act you're going to really run off for a minute that's fine but you have kind of squandered the goldie by not letting you win the two onto any harder well he's got a double-book for himself to settle for a bit that's the flavor give power for the meantime and also mean since so many cool down for use on the bottom side of the map that didn't get left alone in that top side match up with the orange gets a consistently threatened 369 and 50 uses teleport Early Trades aggressively trying to force out the same from 369 rm2 to bring us closer possible because health and Mana back up with me which website down here for the whole nine on both temporary health and Mana leave for 369 Galaxy hops away from what would be the last part of the W blocks away I believe you got grass by off just in time but either way doesn't mean too much 60s lead car Sarika and get Alaina so is any kind of a tank and fall asleep then jumps away to not forget with the brittle all right now what does Jarvan again you're looking to make a a place off of other crowd control that you have stood up in your lane but you can also turn your eyes towards in a collie went to call is level six because night splash was used already on long cool down still left on it and if you get level 6 kill for a collie for Angel it actually can snowball incredibly quickly for the sidelines as well because an angel gets the threatened for those rooms for those game he would probably want to go purchase first you still has not gone to get his first break his back yet but that can definitely be another point of pressure so I saw the sun has a lot of options open to him meme through the whole series still active is the easiest way to solo it has pretty media pretend it's not terribly Panky so karsa has no problems doing this on praise course he did get one kills left of a longsword plus red Smite in pretty early on even has some honey fruit essentially full health in Man of the next part of this one so the game state is a v in a gold leaf versus a drake-lee not that too bad on a burn to teleport to get back into Lane this time does have the pickaxe in the now we can start playing field Lane. Jack looks for 3 to get spotted we'll see if it's okay it is going to be towards the blade of the ruined king version of the build-out stackers on this team not hitting a heavy with Frontline but it is 4 x male you're going to get a lot of value out of roofing hurricane alright goes for the invade here and has a D4 to do the confidence with the with a pushing akali mid laying here not too scared of a possibility to Port runs coming out pretty quickly and honestly I don't think I should be an overload on the on the invade he does know that this might was used as a fan has Smite but can't see phase Rush decent were control back and forth I like that really smart shop it throw it out of range no chance rest of us might kill some time
