right you know it is not one of those weeks were coming into to the final week of a split and it's still pretty much undecided you know yes there would have to be some some kind of crazy circumstances were some of the spots to really get disrupted but I do think it is going to be very exciting find a week here dignitas it they could grab a win here against her these they keep their chances alive and then would force the LG to try to have to get to win through for the tiebreaker that can open the door for her for a mortal's units but a three-way tiebreaker there's a lot of crazy scenarios that we could have and I do think that it's a very likely that we're going to at least have some tiebreakers on Sunday in a from what I've seen of 1 2 or 3 tiebreakers are all quite high like 35% or something so that way yes it overpercent just 3% X stand for in first this man has been very early game and talked about someday being a really big deal to topside and we think jungle made is going to be very important match up and Caitlin is a champion I think should be 100% pick ban in proflight it's only about two-thirds of that store that Caitlin is in way too late against her is to play Karma and some other arrangements with Ash is gone but you can find something else to eat the rain and try to keep letting pressure against her has become a really common pick into into Caitlin as well that in Pro play something that you can kind of survival a nun that's really dominate the way to get sealants do be interesting to see if Johnson wants to go that route if he does though I do think that that could be a bit concerning for dipping sauces to get to later stage of the game because Johnson is such a reliable carry for them to do in in that part of the game he is going to depend on very heavily I got a lot of damage done so if you put them on gin you may not necessarily have the other kind ofDPS that you really will need either way double mark them locked in here for a hundred thieves will be interesting to see if they want to go no more supportive lehner in one of the Soul Lanes as a result, has been taken away which what appeared quite well with them but there are obviously other enchanter options there are at so we get to see what the rest of the traffic going to be right now out of these how you plan on the bot Lane are you going to pick somewhere else and they are going for your tea in midlane Zoe and Grace will have a lot of early pressure here I think of how to make sure they can around out there but lay before the bands come through their thing as real as the only good later we're willing to play bands will get us to fight on the tier list which means you can cover it with counter picks by Banning things away and we'll see what it looks like now I mean it is interesting because it is such a priority pick for Jonathan ua7 plays on this soon as he has played in as Rakuten affiliate with tide at 2 I'll be there is no will now be his third play but by finding that out and then the fact that they didn't actually counter band The Caitlin they put themselves in into a pretty heavily Loumatch-up yes, we may be able to swing that somewhat this could also be karma is it so late we have to keep that option open to mention see where hundred thieves will go will they pick a strong lehner alongside the Caitlin I have been actually kind of disappointed by the fact that we're not seeing him the more laying down at the fourth like Nami coming out if you don't want to Blind pick Nami and and then get you into a Champions like that you can just devastate so these bands are amazing to me that this diarrhea and Ciroc are taking band because we don't see them practically at all but the bottom line alongside of Kaitlyn in the karma is real too even though we don't see him we could see them and it's still like the band even though you might not have seen it I think Nautilus is like really likely to approve really enough week more aggressive jungle from dardoch no more good I like that gameLily of course going to have plenty of early aggression there as well let me know that set is mid tops waxed and then only just hasn't been that effective in the ALCS he will think good at getting leads on it but I really struggled I think tattoo kind of clothes out with this Champion so it will be interesting to see if Doc is going to be able to do that you know I do think that he he he's going to be someone who can actually compete against this Graves and who wants to be able to come run over the map and Empower far Billy can keep up as far as the clear speed ghost but overall you know what's 2 + 6 in the LCS or hasn't hasn't been very impressive Labyrinth contract are the two that have a win here. On his first play of the split on this Natalie and I think more junglers are kind of reaching to try to bring out the ditional Harry Styles Tumblr pic we stop first did Ali Pick 4 lottery this week now. Going to hit barta's as the pick your mix I think what a lot of guns Stephanie not nearly strong the lehner as something like Toonami but it gives you a lot of engage options it gives you theNational utility here and it is going to be someone who can really be effective at picking off especially someone like the karma is relatively low mobility and it's going to be relying on that flash to actually escaped from the ultimate I can't allow you to set up pretty effectively and the BART alt into a trap combo is very very affected that's something that's going to allow them to really find a lot of pic but then we threw out the Met game about visiting for the first time since week one where somebody played back-to-back Orange games are what is like you have some day and you're giving him or what are you doing in your draft this time around they have a chance we know to Havelock class again they have control the destiny in order to get themselves into the upper bracket of plastic is a very big deal that you're absolutely fighting for and it's a you know what did working Week 1 but it's 2 months later we think you're at the guitars that blind pick or an is the way to go if I forgot kind of pecanand I'm curious to see if it's a hundred thieves have level up enough to say well somebody on tanks is doing to work for us for a forecast first time I think that was the concern right at that he had the blind pick so you know maybe nervous about some of the pics I buy Pro be willing to bring out you know a lot of people are are kind of assuming that this could be a top Focus game plan because it does seem like a mismatch and Nails has talked about it and we were talking about in the cap to check in Novi for going for some sort of a counter pick in and getting StarTalk options to actually play through that lane so if you are expecting that and it's pretty risky like blind pick a carry on the stair I do think that somebody should be able to withstand is Camille matchup you know Camille obviously with jungle help can get a head but it's difficult for her to really just completely Snowball the way because Orin has sold wave beer and for the most part even from behind can kind of just if get the tower and defend the real question though is you know Ken the rest of the team pick up the slack as far as damage is concerned and can they be those that wincondition but I mean somebody's going to have grade engage there's lots of squishy members Pumas going to have good engage with the ultimate and Cody sun has been a reliable carry plus you have contract on the grade so they're not lacking for damaged by any means courtesy set men here again as well and we'll see what can happen now is it good to us once again feels you just joining us back's against the wall dignitas must-win here for a chance at playoffs or they are gone there season is over and we will wait for 20 21 to see the guitars play League of Legends ever again someday in Viper top side grass provider will make him a stronger will hurt his dueling again someday later on with flip Force going to be slightly weaker but honestly from my experience as not like we talk later if gold that your items when you the match up the runes are less of the factory rep you know 35 minutes but obviously can be relevant matter I think honestly I concur it like matters more and more likely to have the extended trade and competitive play let's be honest Almost 100% of time before and it's just going to stand at the chart not even interact with you once you're at the point where you can actually win the fight so no grass for the part where you actually are writing a lot is incredibly effective that pussy Camille passive makes a lane you're so much more effective here for Viper so if you can get ahead if you can get that gold eyes are saying you're kind of hoping that you can get strong enough to where you can kind of just put in and try to ignore the orange try to take our plates or at least be able to have priority so they can roam around and you know threatened the enemy jungler threat midliner and things like that about that one and just step out the way because Health Partners in spot trades against some rocks as well so very very small early start there. I couldn't bear for his own jungle three camps in right now taking a flu buff down no problem get this. By the way for the Lee actually is worth staff as well but if they do aggressively word against you no feeling comfortable enough there so far early farmaleaf Italy as expected of the Seas mechanic very very strong baby the jungle are most liked most tied your mechanics than any of the jugular I can definitely see that I think I think that's pretty fair to say you know some other ones that are live with more complexity Lilia I think it's like fairly complex now but maybe not had a pro-level you do for pro players in the expectation that they cannot get the all kite the camps perfectly and whatnot I could definitely see Emily being in the most difficult in that regard remember they were actually playing pretty well again, I know that was a fairly winnable game they did end up falling down a but they had a respectable showing in Phoenix was actually going for a full tank set you knows it wasn't set with back-to-back I do think that again it would make sense here for him to go full tank and he's really the only true Frontline Iran the team they have a lot of damage from grass the squad with the in a pretty much pure damage top laner and, as well as I need to leave here to do me adding in some extra damage there so I would like to see him just go full tank again and try to play as at 4 I think there is a lot of damage and I really do think you can get all the way through. Going again for the rest of us because we take so much for the Viper but it still might be this graph is taken away sleeping around the killing of War going to get even more AP from those zombie worth coming through that's going to feel great for him to question is we going to get stopped and really no contracts going the other side of the map he might take wolves he's got wrap this up for himself and he's not fitting that gramp they can't post Away by Darla Pursley as contract until you see if I put you on back in the Top Lane you don't even have an opportunity to go over there because then you just be flipping a coin because you don't know if he's actually sitting in the blue buff brush in a waiting for you and then you can get hookshot over on you and it'll be pretty easy kill so contract had to be more defensive from that situation someday or if the Flash no Viper is back up to the top right now but trouble he'll be just enough but now go get some hot cocoa Ralph Lewis Johnson has massive Ford Viper now in a little bit trouble will be able to back it up but if you go to work the bar to do gay that extra utility but you don't have that straight up leaning prowess that a champion like, can and you can see Cody's have been poked out quite a lot here no app remove zoning am off of this second Coco there and then prove your stuff's too far forward and get chained up and once you actually get that full roof it's pretty easy for Johnson to land a lot of those Gill shots and just straight-up chasing down Cody Sun year they have absolutely everything there really well play by David Tatton who would have needed to hug what do you know towards that little alcove you can actually see through that wall so if you actually move down you got tether you could actually you over the wall and break that tether immediately and then I think you do survive to me that shows a little bit of inexperienced actually on the Bard PICC and it made us something he didn't even think about that because a lot of really great Bard players will utilize The Alcove for magic Journeys to actually you'll be able to escape some situations like that at me to cut a function have arcade shift yourself away though take the nice little time to put it does not matter it means when a fuse get temporary control over the bottom River butt and the day. I feel bad about that one cancel the contract. Part feels good to run to first Blood. Augustine tickets at 7:16 or gold lead also very interesting I don't think I've ever seen, I noticed that bends that's really strange that I'm kind of wondering you know what exactly is thought process is there cuz I I don't think Natalie will really be able to effectively keep that stacked up yes in in all in that situation do if your ears are you jumping can you use all the all the abilities in in cat form then you are going to able to stack it up fairly quickly but it's not as though you then stay there and keep it does not really how I buy to work for her so I'm curious if this is intentional or or maybe a nice pic but difficult and pick rate and went right or both exceptionally low for Concord so it could be pushed Champion but this this almost feels more like it would be around because if you know where I can see it yeah yeah I play but I'll just be like 15 or we can ask about it we can do one better than me but we have a flight now again and it's damaged on the Phoenix without one Dead Rising 2 words probably probably full tank I think it is is smart here you probably not going to make or break the game either way it is something's will have to track you see how it doesn't go through. It could even potentially be in a more about looks of the secondary choices he wants you know he does have zombie Words the movie with you if you want that plus presence of mind but I still don't really understand it cuz you could just go secondary either way we'll see how this does work out for it, but things looking pretty good for digging cost in the early stages soon as they are winning Lanes across the board yet or is just about that even your volume button Jocelyn have the killed or updated form of the top laner up form jungle to upload the farm Midland so and look pretty happy about that me of things hate mid laner left lane
