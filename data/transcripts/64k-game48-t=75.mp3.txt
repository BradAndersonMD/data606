this is going to be a rough game I think most teams from that point where did just continue to try to spoil should maybe try to get something done and probably about the game and said they recognized that wasn't working that group they depending on who he actually find your Breitbart ultimate and multiple times in a row he found the critical members on TSM got them those pics got them those kills and they are one game away from Worlds when they have never won a playoff series in the organization's history prior to this year and it has a split they want and go straight to work about 6 o and then you know a a battle has been faltering in the late have to split it certainly battle they could win because they they were the longest-running Wrote themethey were there for the very first one in 2011 and then 2018-2019 and now about to 20/20 missing it as well and of course rid of the draft so we'll skip this talk for now is set for 6:40 SF play in game 3 against golden Guardian last time around my tree up that one was like yeah give him one more for good times but I will see if they do want to put it in a top indoor jungle it is a three-way flax and fear anything goes to Port but generally only is it considered if it is going to beat your ass in the bottom Lane the Kailyn has been doubt Fitbit Alta TSM you're getting a lil bit more serious have made some adjustments they've been out the Caitlin so that's not going to be over for FBI they take the ass because they areblue sizes that are made out of patience to FBI will be put on more of a supportive stylish Champion we're saying almost exclusively farming Santa so you don't think it's going to be in a fasting Center or anything like that which doesn't mean that you're Double Toasted Beyonce me the hive has higher amounts of GPS they have easier that is a tremendous amount coming out from from the midline as well and we'll see how golden Guardians do look when I think there's going to be more honest on other members other than FBI to really be that seems by Carrie because all the Caitlin he's been getting work done in these last two games and answer again for the Kaiser only half sure that set it up in the Top Lane and I believe it's actually more commonly a jongleur anyway but once that when locked in as soon as possible and they'll wait to see we'll see if he somehow the counter picks so mordekaiser in mind as you can see the mordekaiser in two oranges but we're going to be at work here I mean if if you are willing to actually commit to more of a sideline player a Top Lane dial and I'm not surethen we'll be but Jack's is a great a great matchup right you can block of all of Eric's done with that is a q cancel auto attack you know you win that one the one you can help scale the more Kaiser in the ones you want that can be very very strong it does require some attention that could be protected Jack's especially in the early game when Jackson star leave honorable but you can get at a tremendous athlete Advantage I also think that it can help to denying and match up well against things like the ethical Guardians want to go that way as well because you can also block the gold card with Yuri it's fairly powerful against Santa who is in a Reliance on on you but very strong Auto attack so they can work out go out there and not sure if you would be willing to go to it because it's not just broken play they would have to make you just spent the entire do you have to play differently around one of those kind of Side Lane counter picksall right well mordekaiser being covered by V gang plankenhorn bands DSM throwing some Midland band that we've been seeing out of golden Guardians his Lucien would like a pretty solid liquid and be go to pick that we had before you saw this still want to wait after I met with the echo be like like it's Sandra we like it again this year to really interesting cuz I actually would have felt like the ziggs with it more alongside the Senate because Santa is fairly low DDS right to tell me what a really high sorcery DPS from another Lane the jack that talk about it I think it's a pic I didn't think I'd get that would have the confidence to go to it but they are going to so I'm actually so excited we get to see how TSM can play around a side lane wind condition especially with an ATM and a tank jungler you can rush things like it within which are ridiculously strong in21 and itemized heavily towards that because anyone is going to answer you in the cycling is going to be magic damage if you will carve a lots big the only physical damage they really care about it all is going to be from Santa That's easily answerable by your Counter-Strike do I do think that your item is a she becomes incredibly simple this game you do for Broken Blade that can be really really tough to deal with if they can get it going if you can get the things like with end Destin smirk threads of course you're going to want you know maybe the boy 2 room King and Triforce in there at some point but the AP atomization the antiope itemization is quite strong for the Jack self this is a really smart pick and I like a TSM have the confidence to go to it and what would be an elimination game here for them yeah there is a witty repartee SM it is this when I like this, a lot I think is a good person to ask player I love the Broken Blade back to the second kind of thought he wants to play I want to see speak to spend some time up there Pearson's azir we know is absolutely phenomenal just stopped the draftfeels like TSM taking a game moving Us 2 game for obvious you have to play the game out but I like this one so much I think the The Goldbergs what conditions are so incredibly narrow here but yeah they are but I mean if we Freeze Frame last game you know at the point where DSM gets Soul what are the odds are giving right like if you know you're giving TSM incredible odds so you still have to be able to play with the game and I will say and I think the draft is Fantastic Four TSM but they have not really shown me like The Horde split push style off from their top laner this split they had that one fantastic irelia game but I do think irelia functions more easily in teamfights compared to Jax Pavan X Jackson Whittemore time in those Island and this requires not just an adjustment for Broken Blade because I'm sure he can play the champion it requires an adjustment from your entire team on how you play around the game on protecting the jackpot on escorting In Waves if it ever gets Frozen on them guarding him and all these situations which means not only does your delightfully different well guess whatthe other lane so they have to play more safe so it's a total team shift and that's often why I don't think we see Jack's if you are and champions like that as often as the matchups themselves would dictate which issue all right well we are out of the restaurant could be the last time of the year for TSM they must win this and the next and the next game and then i b o v Cloud 9 if they want their season to stay alive otherwise golden Guardians will complete their sick so sweet during the playoff run and have a date for one final bfi4 world and then maybe even farther along in the playoffs regardless of a good showing for gold Guardian so far FBI and who he have been absolutely phenomenal and it wasn't because of the keeping up pretty well do you assemble see if I can get this one of the finish line here in game three again I'd like the draft broken bow to the late war did as we know it going to be a top side start now for the polar bear and a leash list speaker on rent BF really fast Red Bull out there with the mordekaiser least and folder also just asked you a quite a quick clear on that Red Bluff so he'll be very nice outside if we can get a picture of that to pull the minion so that will push towards if this is to make sure that you have all their can't go for any sort of cheesy level 2-k you Groove Dominion so that they would come to you and then you can you play defensively and still collect that farm because there's always that chance that evolve are just goes red top and then tries to tease you out a meeting on Hunter aside you can see even though yes you know the other men just took some damage will the early is always go down in trade St Frontier on the side table to First me that preys even easier where the jack is because you require the three hits from mordekaiser to park passes that is there so much of his strength is so generally speaking you do that with a Q and E & N Auto you can Counter Strike that auto and push back for a long time him actually pranking that passive right so it's more actually go through you that that work either passive and it makes it very difficult to fight The Upfront damaged coming through from Jax to Jack's players can you continually when you have to go down and then Retreat before it becomes a really extended bite clean Evernote a car and you can you can take zero physical damage to match I bet you play it around Counter-Strike the entire time or something his way but yeah so far so good you see the first potion or he shoved through the forest crafting stock knock out a broken place I can swing the match up and there's no work so we have it Forward OK the cloud will not hit those so this is done Town Huntington Beach right now and we know we know it jump to there's not much else to do so now here comes the jump back to the topside nothing to be defensive flashpro concert didn't want to be flash he's done by speaking to lose the lane but this happens already over that is really well done your front Broken Blade actually think flashing up in that case is better than blacks your jugular because of all of their SKU expired so that is actually what he got because that's the Gap close but that is actually your son as well so many flashes awaits where the Alcove that expires and then vulvar can no longer go for it because you're not going to come down before the set arrive so really intelligent stuff here from Broken Blade speaker coming back in does results in that crate and Hunter has actually base right to Hunter's first by is just a refillable and the cloth armor broken plate still has two biscuits & Noble chart are from from his class so much better by and now they're looking glass broken plate has teleporting get away without Flash there's a chance for the things do unlikely your gums to pull back not going to Land Rover by the minions and time is spent pops by the other day and I can't just put it on speaker but it it's froze the lane against it so it's actually going to eat equalizer bar and now he has to be back in just all she had to do is just walk in recess a wave and then probably faces and walk back to Lane has PP Advantage it's dead because the wave is frozen off of that cake he took multiple power shots he has to go back to base before he hadn't even better by Jessica visit teleport to unfreeze Elaine so you know they took what was a really big winning made it worse good Bart very close to that's going in TSM favorite because it is that he'll for the flash well played overall by the Golden Gardens go to fight their way out of what was a 3D to so pretty nice stuff for that I will see how much is Farm Duluth can grab but it is going to be a golden Guardian spawn leave your somewhat expected in before relief days before, I definitely have the advantage is ignite, karma's a very have leaked item rising and setting up router for that Laney baby dolls that is really for the way here from whence belfies going dark souls whose you have a tremendous amount of Mana regen in Black Manta and really just try to slam this to be to this is the first time it felt like you had a big TV to type advantage in this series so far in the lady face and they're going to try that. which network right well post game overall in at least for now hunting to lick his wounds and catch some Farm he's going to remain under ten Zs difference will though it's probably on a crow over the course of time the first week of work late. Massive lunch with a different place pretty good cloth armor but we'll see if this can move any further for now because I'm through the bottom line FBI getting a pretty nice and this is the first time he's gone play the ruined King across the three asking so far things okay you do have plans we're not going to try to force the cleanse tag to do much we're going to go for optimal he'll fight Bowser a lot it's it's understandable but slow hell thanks for getting the house back and it did hurt your GPS having The Vamps after four lane also can be pretty nice when you're playing at the karma who you know really is going to depend upon that photo that coke to to get control of the lanes you know as much as you're saying LOL Target okay, but if you're getting that mordekaiser that ball the bear in The Champions that are building up quite a lot of help when they are high on El Colibri King obviously going to have a lot of the dollar bill here and I'm excited to see where Broken Blade goes and is built I am expecting boy the ranking first and if that's pretty darn standard these days but where he goes after the triforces the most standard or something I would really be interesting to me now a fight in a Polar Bear Creek flooded you not one is forced to 6 but doesn't open for the fight may be a possibility there but if we needed it so not going to get a whole lot done regardless of the way she's being pushed in TSM 200 Gold by putting it back in might be getting their own we'll see if they want to stick around for this one seems like people have no Ward control speaker is on crutches and ready for this word might be a little difficult 3 level 6 for biofrost not the same for who he and thankfully Karma has an Ulta in the first few levels and now if I can a midline Devonte give me a bit Locust hold it back by Pearson Olson for the health but overall deer should not going to take the winds that trade overall
