at the top of the table and they are going to be competing for sole possession of first place are you here we go right off the bat the picks and bans have begun a truck still banned he's not wanted to play around anymore. I know rakaan for old and make some plays either and we did talk about last weekend of he's not be able to play with funnel anymore and the interview with Frawley and I forget which other players talk with the fact that fellow seems to be dead I'm not sure it truly is but maybe not in the Playbook this week it would be kind of a reinvention of a strategy war of a sharing of gold between two people that are just full gold bullion to one person until that jungle item is completed at least either way not turn and aatrox to the Mainstay for band on the read side-scan it's going to be grabbing his Kindred in this is a pretty exciting one for me and one of those kind of early adopters of Kindred way back in the daywill be the second play of the split and conspicuously though it has gone through the first pick. Being grabbed right now she's been a very popular bit later did get some nurse 8:14 and right now still no rush Jeff brohm grab her after you down to the bottom Lane and we had heard the various players are the analysts during the countdown to the wind condition worth for Team Liquid at 1 a double to have Lain pressure playing in such as a blade of the ruined King veristor a storm razor work in my field trip Marshfield right now there is brown can be very strong Duo there are pistachio pudding survive that's just what they want to be going through the the band is kind of more circumspect with them the other team's players enough they couldn't pick it up but between the two of them there is one play and that is this on the side of a re you so see if you is going to grab that up for himselfor if it's it just a matter of this keeps feeling like they have a good answer to it the answer is there has to be a chance to ban it away afterwards I diffuse have an uncontested final pick of the midline or something else in the first pumpkin Dash in the bottle in plenty of Crocker Hill and see if they need it but not terribly so I think he's playing pretty well so far to split king of the jungle also has plenty of pressure available to people in fact his match Lane rosters right now is trouble comes in for a jungle has an don't play that what are the things that is always an advantage of drafting against DL is is almost always you feel like impact is going to come as default appointment at thank you camp and if he's playing thank the champion you can kind of more comfortably pick I trundled knowing that there's like we going to be a tank to actually all first asked to see a lot of people actually can free counterpick tanks as wellresult in win but it is something that can help each team in the draft and I think that's kind of a what hundred years is looking at here with that tremble pick as it's not the best match of individually into the Kindred and you would have hoped to have a thank y'all wouldn't let the teams right here you can see we do have to look at playing with their two coaches dodo and now pain right here of course Frawley Alone by himself coaching the team decided to make with Four Paws to get flare I trust them to know that a place that you can wait for the camp so I could be okay either way it is on their side you would they are still worried about some potential other non tanks but if you remove the option more likely to play a tank and you can put your style of course and and the GP ban kind of tells me that impact does want to play a tank though you know what would your GPA be all right you know what is GP than good into that is generally tank matchups were GPS has a pretty favorable time there and somebody obviously isn't very strong game playeris it that you most often does Platos hang fix the ugly has a playdate Rocky athletic and some of these other Champion another champion that you do not have considered one of those Champion he's very good into tank match up so expecting something brass like a mudo to come through here for impact something along those lines could be as well if they want more engage but having gas make the I think lots of requirement so are you going to reprise his role on this do is hit me that gets locked in go through a solid 6 picks Ben 10 bands and Zoe Salon table light lower priority across the world but actually his first doubled up Champion pic of the entire split for Mid laner as far as I'm concerned he's played to flatten the bottomlands like that one character liquid looks like it's going to be syndra at least that's what they consider to be very good jokein truth, like so he's not a more mid-range semi that you can equalize Lanes very easily once you get this once you have a little a little bit of a very well for the Kindred here by the Smithy is going to be playing and also the follow up on any potential act engages with that Chris Alero front of a very powerful there is expected impact is going to a tank that is kind of his natural play style in the band did kind of the word that as well but it's not going to be any truly bad mad if I do think that has priority over the 10 for shenmue do early even with that Advantage as long as they packed with bling intelligently is playing safely it shouldn't be that bad that being said though anytime you're playing choke at the champion that canfor 5000 HP you are then making and a on this trundle so much more Tanki in that does give them much more of a an easy opportunity kind of burned down impact definitely agree to watch the lineups here to look at the pretty conventional comes near double tank in the front lines get advice from Jungle are fairly Mitchell Marksman down for double if not we see a ton of North America but hasn't popular worldwide filter on a second malzahar pretty conventional Mage right here cuz there's your lineup for team liquid in the force on the hundred decide pretty standard stuff here as they switch the champions in for you dr. Mundo not it doesn't surprise me Sophie how could the coach handshake is a timer 6 down the end of cons and probablyThe rosters top winners junglers midlane. Lane and support welcome to summoner's Rift Team Liquid versus hundred thieves a rematch of the spring split finals Team Liquid one that 320 now it's time for the summer split rematches they do battle here today Wicked one of the first time as well as the battle comes down the Midlands actually you do you go up there and you fight to try to push back the opposing team so that you're done working kind of sneak in there and gets bought it will be put back in the end result in your butt butt Explosive Start yeah yeah yeah I can actually hear me through this Valley is going to be a bad recall any trading back and forth here but certainly does going to pay 400 East and maybe stay around and try to take this Red Bluff if he comes over into them it could be really bad for you know they're they're going to land some pictures around which barrier Shield cuz you as well and that was it out to flashes on this invade even done any damage to Canada down down on HP on the other side of the map in hide a camera flashes down on the tailbali and as well so and I could look for a Yankee or do the pillar later on early 4/4 belt replacement level 1 did not have good ways out of that one and I can't even take us to the other side of the map is truly safe Lil Wayne started his first cab best route all right I mean this is brutal I don't really understand why he's even staying around what are you going to do you have your W your level one are you really going to be able to actually get over the wall and try to use in Canasta can't I think it's extremely unlikely so no needed maybe just cut his losses and start I just called him he can't do he can't do the Scuttle either you still have one fills your OCS like I don't really get what the game plan is. It's really tough though because Kindred is so bad at actually doing the Raptors lose all your help if you try to do Raptors at level one you really die or at least very least a few spider boss so he's working out start of wolves all right beat level 3 to level one he's just now starting his first camp and going to get it about 4 minutes into the game the 4-minute level two is maybe not quite the goals there I think I would be willing to bet this is one of the worst start ever in a professional game for a jongleur latest level 2 diver seen I'll be very interested to see stats on that but it means you lose his boss cuddles he gets for bucked he dies like this is an absurd Advantage for and onion and the game is now in in does hands right like you should be the one who are being proactive from this point in you know I would like to see him you to put that pressure on for my break they got all the flashes from CL Spotlight at 1 p.m. to get down there look for a place there I think that is a tremendously eezygang to make when you do have that frontal pillar is having never use Smite he had to charge right away so the Wolves weren't back in but obviously he really really painful rough start here with your back North mid lane pobelter actually doing a good job in the landing phase that's a good farm from self it's the temperature is going to be quicker to just accept all right I can't get that start somewhere else do you know give up the minimum but because he decided to a stay around for the red beetle won't be 3 Thang is pushed off that then he kind of has a son just doing wolves he tries to go to Scuttle still level one can't do that either well now you're going to lose your blue then he doesn't want to give up the blue so now you're going to die and it tasted really snowball start already sucks let's make it as as kind of manageable as possible and just immediately walked wolves start wolves and then hit level two and go from there well right now A5 camp veranda and we'll see what street it looks like yours is going to go to lead is too much what you'd expect out of that one thing real quick to stantial up for double Pinole a it is going to be teleport for this ash down here by the way and yeah there's the pretty softball and start + 14 CF Pro play almost always you're seeing you no lunch or three pot or food for Fallout ordering something along those lines so this is super kind of out of left field in I do think that it makes your Burleigh Lane in a lot weaker I do think that it'll in the long run it's going to kind of be a more valuable item because every time you go back to basic any additional value from this but I do like that and it in over on that infernal will be able to pick up this from self easily and that is because of your vanity is gabion utterly game so fast it does have paying forward towards later the river is like what I mean Division. And then have a chance of passing his back walkover get to give it up but now fighting the topside those things are built in fact has the chomp of course at Sunday Park supposed to go down to the big trade walks away someday so far up a little bit in the top way that is expected you know you can you do for the Foley a little bit of such a bad level six but uses his ultimate on cream cheese actually stacking just kind of looking forward toward that later save the game in as long as you play Bentley how you get so much calcium in it back from your past it from farming these Minions that I shouldn't be under any threat of dying really unless it don't go to shows up and what is the I am a little bit disappointed that and it didn't actually kind of return back to bottom line with no flashes are especially because of the TL bottom Lane has been pressuring as you have pointed out but you know you can
