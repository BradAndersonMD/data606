game 3 of groups be here TSM versus Genji is the battle TSM all they have left to do is Place spoiler for try to finish up in third which may still be possible based on the results so far at least tying lgd at that point Genji are fighting for of course a spot in the quarterfinals There are 16 in 1/3 mostly if they lose out and permutations into the top off a Fitbit BTS they are at work in a tiebreaker and this was hoping for a courses at least talk to me but they would love to top it with that date with fanatical later on in the day looking to get some of that take off their face hoping to get themselves to wins overall to close out their world run exactly DSM right now playing for honor and I don't evenneed any differences in Champion Select from them I'm looking for Corrections on the field in the play from the player more proactive that Killer Instinct don't let the opponent Run the game let's take a look here the final Bandit from Genji is the Camille taken away from the hand of Broken Blade guy it will be a different when ignition 10:40 to get Lucian picked up here certainly a highly of world band wrote in the group stages band that played for time has not lost yet very powerful right now in the solo Lane PSM at them selves use this in North America in the LCS playoffs it was a big pick up for them consistently bad after they found their victories where it's a high-pressure Lane Broken Blade was able to successfully use it they can flight disappeared soon as well so really like the furpick up your core TSM and I wonder what gender you are thinking as far as there are cancer is going to be and with an orange we are going out scale dsm's early aggression we don't think that they are going to bring it to us as they saw earlier in the day and and they think that they can just get to those extra or nice Santa can stack up our souls and play through that way and I'm looking to find some Magic Image Neville not going to go for a little league instead of crowd control speak of their on the Lilia Garcia said she has the most pollution came from the split of course you can double as one on the split so far and now it's time for the third pick we know what's going on the other side you've got the Santa coming down there has there been Flex as a real support pick it's always been really taking it as a farmer down there were no orangeBarracuda be the answer honestly thinks that I support kind of sucks I'm definitely not a big fan so I'm hoping that they do put it in his hands and they draft the grave so looking for a high damage control Maids highly probable there for bdd that's probably what she has Dan waktu Focus their Vans out mean while looking across at the volibear Lucian solo lanes and I'm trying to figure out what they're going to do about support take away some of the engage opportunities again a big part of if you are trying to go for a better feeling composition is taking away long-range and Gates and crowd control support from your opponent so that they can't force it on you girly you don't get to put the extra pressure on your lanes and on your dragons acting right now most likely Bjergsen pick on this Lucien that's where everyone else puts the champion but we'll have to see it is flexiblewild Bronco II support band a good answer to when you put up the shields you break or insulting make that can't pretty weak overall to kill him in a long field team fight without the crowd control protection ban about sign up for the team fights over all vinyl banner also be aimed at midlane probably another allow any sort of room around there from life let's see what the early one they can actually stayed vdd Pick 4 for guaranteed counterpick for themselves they already are you a pic right now I think Oriana is deer both decent options dilution is going to have pressure in to you regardless because you know you do need that AP damage for your team givenset up that you have right now so just go for it and and play the little bit defensive early on hell yeah I was so it's going to be much more around box side they played four games more or less of trying to have Broken Blade carry and that had not turned to anything so it's now the Bjergsen NW show late game team fighting on the other and everyone else is there to support initiative a little weak thresh hook isn't amazing amazing swirl speed is mediocre we get time to make the pot little bit safer Odyssey 70k going to have no problems in the early to onto you don't have any real feel pressure bear will see now if the or inorganic you fighting for Genji individual cheer for TSM Lucian and threats have been some of the most banned champion at the entire tournament biofrost there's a big magnifying glass on him for creating plays for this team or findwork with because Lily at for these trying to get some pants taken away from control there and we shall see TSM get on the board fighting for Honor here in the group but also could be a big spoiler to Genji Genji hopes are high for a 1st seed coming off that previous Victory Britain's LTD the only way by date at least by breaker for getting out of group the only way they can be dropped to just straight-up third is if TSM win this game there have to be more going on of course not the only scenario but that would be TSM allowing an lck team to fall out in groups will see that come through here again TSM really only fighting for Honor they can do at best a tie for third if lgd drop all their games and it's a little bit of Saving Face but they can never make quarterfinals with the 0 and 4 record just the way the groups of shaken out so far Genji though looking for Dolla Sign of early pressure topside at speaker fightPorsche of the Jungle will do so and I've been knocked down the Lord to get the goalie of the icky but now the most 3 on 3 in from Lilia with your cue length of these things to get all your health bar back entirely and it is another trend of LCS teams with a good level one putting out a really good start the game off of Full Camp Clik just now starting on this is the signs of life that LCS Bans are looking for from TSM you know some to practice flight starting to get off on the right foot this does section 2 map so vile Quest and double it will have to be cognizant it has to be bottom side of the map be careful with your trading be careful with pushing for early level to be DD getting chased down into the river by clit is healing to go for the rain gauge with ghostthe Summoner have to go for the blacks falling not going to get anymore and it's to flatten for Gen Z Plus the coast for the black speaker again this is TSM, losing 74. Play as a hail of blades time can sure know it's not the hell is lights on Kent you still got it because of the mid play that where they chased out speak up it is to be clipped doing this away while speaker can come find him there's no Smite for speaker so quit should be able to get it regardless giving up the fight at least watch this might take for the eclipse is on the chase he's got the first blood coming through for bjork's in the kind of game and a fast one of the sea but now.could be good in a battle DVD to flash listen to Power shots but this is also double bumps on mid lane at Lucien piercing getting that kill is huge also with a one-v-one on his Lane opponent because BTD did not have either Summoner spell from the last time they chased him down he is very good signs are for TSM speaker going to be able to get the crab afterwards replenishing his men a critically as it goes for the second Raptor Steel 2 minutes is the response pollark amps is going to get scouted out here but shouldn't be too dangerous for him at the outside of an overall he knows you for the big chicken and honestly I got those thingsLilia is so good at playing for Raptors because you get some like three help for second region on everything packed with a spell and their split 7-6 pieces that can see you're like Out regening Auto V PS4 money for Living in scenario you are always safe taking that camping yeah no problem I'll speak to watch right now for anybody that can apply towels Target Evelyn as well all these early level junglers I do once you went to flop a level one in bed to keep up the timer on the Raptors 2 minutes is is really easy for a return since Raptors are centered at the the mid lane it's really easy to make your jungle path very flexible around that area especially since you have a lesionright now it's still a close game 400 gold difference is going to keep it close to Smite goes through clip gets bottom Scuttle at Sea could finish crugs going to fight over this Ward and Drake could well be attacked but it was leased by pick a fight lose them how to plant turned out not going to mean too much overall we stay at the four hundred gold difference stop playing small farm lead to the full of are you kind of suck to one lane again store in similarly on and then so far so good for Broken Blade again it means more to look at the bottom side of the map early recall came through for doubles for a cold very similar here for ruler on the Santa so far lately for Genji's do and don'ts Douglas have not been seen in quite a while so you can see that hesitation here BTD slowly moving up doesn't want to expose himself too much to the Lilia is ghost is now come back off cool down so that plus call include over my does give him the copy Sports indecent damage couldn't place up there with y'all T Still Still takes a lot of damage back from Torrid shots Broken Blade I need to look for fresh or he's going to bring it is here as well as to what's going on level be for speakers and they get the root end of the turrets o life going to lose what's a great help you when you got any of that about two-thirds walk away from that play top link control spoken to go to you since Lakeland cannot fight for control word of mouth will regen and I'll come pick you up off of these rugs and put cannot face check it'll be another Camp stolen away is fika dies with a crusty Laswell going to be even further head Blitz step into his own holding a lot of these Lanes clit at half this is a kind of her forward to the YMCA to TS them and we only get in game 5 Jungle Theory early on in the first game where the rise of these power clear is is greatly accelerated by strong lanes for yourself during that entire scenario where you're talkin Lucian gertsen was moving up into the jungle to self there is no possible answer from Genji TSM playing around their jungler trying to lift speaker up but life as well now has got to reset and round out support to have something to say about it blows now fighting for the Red Bluff is it dangerous to level 6 with Mike was down so you can get any more done but still 49 in the jungle right now and still momentarily a two-level lead 10.1 thing out about these total recall seeing a lot of 80 carries it's great on pick up Champions like ruler set up because that's the recall he wants doublelift cannot afford BF sword I don't know BF store timing and I think it's a smaller piece I'm not a huge fan of vehicle recall on Via all right just give a little bit of time there for the room to we saw very impactful move from Life by marrying a little bit but no extra Visions play behind in the in the jungle there so after the reset they're still going to have to try and come test towards the river and right now ruler and life with the slow push accruing here on these minion he's not trying to put the very quickly he's building it up weight extra pressure and control board can come down last fall as done topside Roscoe's opiates not going to come through and DSM find a third kill the game 600lt a champion it is all in broken blades control this or he could have come right over say don't go for a freeze on it bottom side though under harassment we talked about that big meeting with that was slowly building up for ruler and life and they're trying to punish double it under power making Miss some of the Tea Act find the root and soul taken away from Douglas now quit taking away frogs sorry and maybe for the pipe here as well starting to walk that was out to get them Duo healers use bright flash Lantern separation between a safety hazard can play Right Thurr speaker do off the front of a Flash and he'll get stopped side Scuttle and can look to get even more done if they ripped Harold gets another Raptor can't steal 21 CSD now in the jungle was the biggest we have seen yet to level one and only relevant but he kept the pressure up thoughtful Under Fire 2 to replace already taken its at CSM so far in the back foot heater in the wind condition
