pirate beard earlier on of the countdown till he gets a good somatic here for the day and worked out well for him it's time for an upset and Team Liquid doing battle back then I was asking was all inside of T Allen and talked about those matches being in their favor played a couple weeks ago and there is always the possibility that CL is not evil play the Terrors of Carrie toppling style where they have struggled the time we got to see what the traffic going to give us and talking to some of the players and staff members they think this is going to be a lot more set a 3 o clock West have been looking very strong recently well as Team Liquid ended the split with quite a few losses let's get into it though letendre where the band ripe off the table gear from pobelter this guy has been doing so much work for flyquest roaming around setting up he made really playing wellVictory there but it means that what they want to play was showing that gives you look at the release doubting as we haven't seen T elfland 9.6 yet we saw flyquest tested all the way to gain 5. Comic Con going to be a little bit helpful on the band facing Gangplank and Silas dropped away from Impact giving him the building is as you can mention does playoffs how much of that is really indicative of their level of play how much that was being a bit lacks is in Taco table this morning that's the question I have some people were saying people work in the Team Liquid kind of supporters saying that oh well they already locked in first of course they're going to experiment of course they're going to do these different things the days is one of those experimentations that wasn't really working out as well for them. So seriously if it is that the kind of place all if they want to chill will see if impact 10 deliver a betterdo I do here today against Viper who is such an excellent care vs. carry toddler I kind of like opening with a J fikry because Fiddler's to yesterday where are you open was eat Eric Stone a bottom land that if it does working Gameboy then you can receive some more section band looking for throughout the series what if it flops on his plate so well last week and grab that one no problems to look at time to round up breast milk composition I increase to even seeing bottling pics later and later on to the bathroom a longer flight those same face blinds at all ready to go in game one we saw yesterday Cloud 9 full. And game number one to get a win over to you and empty at Sandpiper out how they were not ready for that naked band out the rest of the. But again if you can get a win in the first game like this that can earn you some extra credit for the band later in the series it does have to work though and they are blind pickingbottom Lane at the Fort they playing that galio and I've been hearing a lot of discussion from Frozen about the fact that they feel you can pick extremely kind of go to be greedy scaling a DS into this. Lame because they don't feel that improve play they should be able to find a few heavily in Lane things long line of cars mod Jinx they feel that you can get away with it and then just have Superior DPS when you do come to that late-game if you can survive to that point that we saw has been in smoothie they took the vein into it got people really killing Lane with The Condemned against the wall on the Sonos who is squishy and susceptible to birth and one of those big things yesterday with the composition of Cloud 9 and when they did have it on his hair was the tack room game on the acronym use multiple levels ahead of his opposing jungler he had the heart engaged with that champion to pair up with tarek and it really dobring the composition together by Mr eazi will TLC so much harder to use defensively then it is offensive and watching the steampunk play on it does feel like any of these Donuts are at comp are very mid-game focus when he has been turned off it was born but she'll start to fall off from there he's not going to stay late game impact as a five of them as real or thinks receiver for Tyson is kind of face soap from the bottom line can withstand the three items like in mid game start to feel better for them but you have to get through that against if it's the same and you are also, combining that with the chase early lethality Jason have a similar curve there and it's different damage types of a threat so stupid are putting together a very strong mid-game for themselves hereyou're going to have a really effective early to levels early but very very likely could be no Black Cleaver sort of style I do think I left there is very well with the character pin him in with your ultimate you can use the Dazzle off them with the Batman dingoes done giving me to call DC for the Oahu is to be really powerful in those early minutes of the game of speed and the Jace acceleration gate work very well for Olaf and Ken and as in gauges for the team to on the side of life Quest though they have also locked in the stowey for pobelter is game 5 winning Champion when he absolutely hard cherried for flyquest to get them here today he's on this once again there once again lexbee irelia up to Viper we talked about not even having that many recent games on irelia but having the confidence to play thatflags for the team and it worked out a credibly well now irelia vs Ken and top-end is one of the things people looked at as a possibility can healthy flyquest upset happen get the cable tray matchup let's play for hopefully one of experience was kind of camping with a bit of attitude on this kind of champion and we'll see if they can withstand the mid-game spikes and if they can get into the game and wildturtle to do the late game caring that he has been doing throughout the back half of the split start to go to the shake hands inverts always in front of the Silas year for the first 15 games you thought this is definitely the swatty 14 and 1 start but then a three-game losing streak Jensen doublelift core JJ blue Juggernaut in their roles in flag quest for the rookie top laner and a few new editions as well have Medics make top force and itspause rep here we are at house fashionable does Tara cluck leaving the fountain in here in the ALCS undefeated in the playoffs in Team Liquid or DeSean a little bit of something new you even though it's been seen before I have flyquest are going to hope that Viper on comfort and wildturtle the same to make another mess if I series Winn-Dixie Alfonso going to have some questions you know when to draft that you were expecting a d from TL doublelift I do not have the best history on Mages in the bottling This Is War similar to that style in fact not the guy you want to seelooking for two more shots to kill him we'll have to bring the flash someone here might be an impact auto shipping the real Flash on Zoe escape from the bottom side and that is Team Liquid already securing first plaid for their top laner impact on Ken and now is going to have the extra money to get more aggressive with a 5-minute invade on TL on the top side to try to get Ward's up there and they saw some members of seal on the top sides of DJ internal think it's safe to walk in your on the bottom side and get those Wards down but Jace as well as Eric waiting their Landing the double Bastion yeah running into the Terex done here they're able to land a Double JJ taking way too much damage there the rest of Team Liquidare here to help Corral him impact flashing over the wild out has expended here are going to need to be tracked by the junglers impact is a head-on Kenan and in the range match if you want to try and friend but without that flash GIF to be so cognizant of where is santorin Rex is a very potent ganker early on Can't Go For Those flash place is that is why impact right now is letting the minion wave sit in the middle and speaking of impact he did not get time to recalls the first blood does not affect the landing phase right now no extra items brought in here for the fight so it will still be a fairly straight up 1 V1 and again I'd mention flash down just like any for split impact text sleep a bit behind. I think he's going to have to hold on to that lighting Rush use it pretty defensively know when you are these awkward positions you want to make sure that you're not too aggressively because of the Jungle shows up you have no class you have no lightning Rush could be so susceptible to going downdr. Domanski in Central Coast Suites towards make sure that okay impact does it have to play with walk over here and since I know that when he goes for the shuttle will probably be by the Scuttle crab word that is so common by all teams on both of them so he'll know that he's been scouted if you do avoid all those words o r x I can actually go much more deep into enemy territory from from behind a funeral the topside not to be the case though she's been scouted and we'll go back to the Jungle to finish clearingit's going to be a camp and a half behind Zoloft right now it's a bit to use knockdown 6 consult still has a shuttle to take instead of his normal Camp straps the red spot under going to go back on the map never seen that happen for my jungler Toby so if you've done that either but it is efficient Focus year for Smithy goes for the power clear on Olaf just getting all the camps down this early then you go out for some Vision work and you come back to your jungle starting at that top again they will all be responding in line at higher experience and you going to continue your power to swing by the fat route to level six and you have a little bit of time here while you're waiting for them to respond to go get some invade done and other really kind of interesting thing about this donut are the bottom line is the axis double side phone says you're going further into the game and we talked about made game and that being a lot of power around that you can play even more effectively around injectors like the early Barons because you have two people to heal you throughthe damn show me the bear but also because you got the vision to be actually be able to set up an in kind of secure those objectives that'll be sunny me see you soon enough that you're seeing of course it is for today taking all the normal Farm as they wait for SS to finish this Quest and then once that's done to going to go to the back and getting all the gold and actually it was a losing a lot of farm up to the pushing of Sven and smoothie in this case for like or JJ JJ on the guitar on all series have not punished Eric's party that she's acting just as well as much more difficult when you have a male a champion at your side to try and punish the Terex own Elaine so that's why they were so confident to lock this in after seeing the galley O'Hurley you can't see the how this Lane and windproof Oak right and double it is going to be able to focus almost solely on this poking at Verizon he doesn't have to actually Farms you're playing the stone on every time total is actually going for a farm you can be frightening to step forward and letting that Poconos results Turtle has already he's been in his potion and is sitting about to Thursday this week not going to lose too much there but he'll stay safe for now is that what it's 14 Golden Pin walk back to safety and this lady really is going to be frustrating to play against if they can get you into a sort of poke battle because I only have their fashion filters Guardian Killzone a w also add the shields are in the phrase I just one of those things where when you're choosing to fight against it at the black ones lineup you have to be sure that you're going to be able to have essentially that lethal damage that you can actually fully finished them off or they will start to feel up at the same through those really can't look turn things around we just looking by the ward is the oil off of a Smithy and often times you feel safe when you have that drink it down because you think it sees them at all there is JJ does Flotsam easy walk out for the Olaf but that's really unfortunate committed the controller and everything and won't get the Drake yeah I got to be a little bit more sneaky it's only like a blast phone over the top or something JJ wraps around does find it absolutely no sneaky Dragon early on Santorum just cruising back to the top sites to see in farming here and no reward for the early play and speaking of rewards login to watch. LoL Esports. Com set for the entire series rewards for watching those games to make sure you logged in to watch the games you can even filter on Twitch past perfect credible yep and in the top when we do now know that it's going to be a peek at it very likely the revolver has come through and we just be yesterday actually gunblade Bill coming out on the tenant which I believe we appreciate that. Always is a triprotic all trash if you're going to go for the AP or soda more hybrid build on that I think is what would make the most sense with this sort of composition we were talking up make me Focus 2.0 belt AP dive in there getting all that damage down it makes a lot of sense that the volume a lot more specifically versus the Gangplank matchup irelia here in fact is going to be a bit worried about the all in Orillia now post level 6 had the wreck site as the jungle so for flyquest died this is one of the big area if you want to look at is the total length of your. On the Zoe isn't great at taking over game could get him an early lead and Phifer on the irelia this new guy rookie of the split for flyquest is on one of those Cari Champion's in a topside
