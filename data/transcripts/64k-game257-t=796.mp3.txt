so far he has already been able to find early games except with what is the least during the regular season of that final DSM if you pick something a little bit more aggressive than a couple of playmaking already off the bat taking away the stone at Erica SK Telecom don't want you to play it and they probably don't want to place themselves all right he certainly have their work cut out for them. They're big player right now you look back at their game against did get pretty big on the Kaiser was a potential carry threat there but couldn't put that old line is rest up Squad got kind of just down at the clit has been the big one and as you wait to see no jungle banned from the Roxy he might just take over head again look at the difference in Champion Select for this matchup between these two teams as compared to all these other ones at MSI so many of those flexible Pixarbecause there are more important Target fans here for the taking out this Joey in addition Target Denton in the Midway rek'sai there was the champion that clit had that your 700 game on where he really dominate it's a little bit of adjustments already in the most played champion of the year for impact was 10 and take enough table here as well as games like as I can see conspicuously very big so far by faith. Might get trapped in the next round of the draft for rice for sick year so is Rise being left open both akali and Javed are up for the other side of politics it away that are free to make their way to the drafted I feel like a job in is one of the best jobs in the world by impact rice get picked up but she going to let it to ya and he has the option of the lease in to fall back on if the darvin's even take away here so if they get the two powerful flexible fix that are left up here to get the risewhere the highest prize one of those Plex pics but the Silas and a collie both going over to Faker and con here will be difficult to deal with and there's no gangs like being hybrid impact has not played a rise game all year long despite all the other games are games like grabbed the right off the top we now know just playing that once was not flexible SKT can make sure they prefer which one of those do not have the file is Macaulay but Theft V Rowling's locked in at the very beginning I do think so the rise of the pretty decent collie and the Silas so I think that fine leaving it in the mid lane and I just hoping that impacted to come to take and something they can just play relatively safe a gangsta to fight auction from the side of SKT so mean to have a couple of the game they haven't engagedbest all right now exactly Douglas highest elevation on the team by a lot. Above 73% he has been the big playmaker damage chair at the very top and that's what is well this is a double Focus team even with Jensen even with impact is very strong players about the bottom in here for TLS Katie they get the signature pick for clit it's still more than double any other champion in his pool Gleason surprise here with the last walking from SK Telecom matching all Lanes picture by team liquid this only leaves the bottom Lane open and SK Telecom will be able to stay there counter Pick 4 last as well this means that they all looking at potential stupor canopy if SKT wants to go for a blind pimple on his wealth alternative they could just go for the bars as well which means that if you paired up with an aggressive support like the Nautilus all the galio then you can look the play for and aggressively insulting of the you can just take the timeand then you have a very safe I do expect the Tom kench band coming through here because if you have a games like if you have a ride if you have these things that you're looking at find a used Ultimate Sports the bottom side of the map of the biggest in the house is the time can still see if they do that Morgana was the first one here for Team Liquid and work on off the table as well and I'm wondering if it's going to be a very aggressive support out of TL what's livid not Elizabeth Requiem played at this year but even a house or something else that goes then look for have you push there's a horse the Nautilus band and looks like TI one more band to go for Teddy can lock in this one chance for us Katie Cali o or are they do kind of highest priority support still left on the table for both of them I guess I think the time can't is probably the better ban here for the team liquid side but we shall see if they have an answer right and then you question what you didn't pick him up Dahlia with multiple Donna and the norliss left so it looks likethe first thing as real band Madonna Bandit still getting rid of the safest option the bottom line is is still been telegraphed the whole way through started saying they want to give pressure with a double if so he gets very a very aggressive early jungler Tom Kent can let him play Super aggro double come with one of each with Elaine and be immune to ganked with corded on Tom catch the Team Liquid leak Alyssa galio once they hit a lot of engage often played at the jungle in the early game also has a lot of options. I feel like a pro team have their eye set on a neighboring that duo the question is which 140 elcon can do the same thing with thispraetorian plays at the end of the first round robin Team Liquid from North America SK Telecom T1 from South Korea so rarely does nav Korea but it's actually a chance in this best of one Team Liquid put together a super team they got Jensen over they got core JJ of recent world champion and it felt like this was the chance for any to make a big stride it's at Katie's return-to-form clit has been phenomenal the rest of the squad is ready to go and Daya number three of the MSI group state is ready to begin and I vs. Korea Team Liquid vs. SKT T1a return to form for SK Telecom T1 on the red side and a hopeful strolling of greatness here for a team liquid Faker back on a world stage your MSI 2918 with his new looks exactly Team Liquid the team North America built for international success leave trying to make upgrades even after back-to-back North American LCS title victories was all made for this moment adding Jensen adding core JJ definitely strengthen the team overall but they need to provide results on the international stagespeaking of Jensen is that she chose to drown the comet in this matchup against akali brawls in the face with a little bit surprising considering how mobile the akali is devastating for a little bit more of a dining room Trace try to poke that a colleague out and have a little bit more pressure in the other game I thought it was a trick that were down there be able to stab self they came down after the Red Bluff instead they actually know that she was going for this little brush play right here and not really game very important to have early information on enemy jungler passing as you can see there is a ward here by SK Telecom on the blue buff of Team Liquid so they know for sure that extended starting on the bottom side with no leaf on the Darvin and it kind of takes away the potency of the level to Red Bluff Jarvan gang 650 is it going to warm up the crowd afterwards go down to his will try and track early game we've had this magnifying glass to players is there okay where the way going to meet Corte De going to try to not give his information not a to get knocked out to answer an ask Katie get one for themselves ends up being Jungle full support jokes while as you say Cody in this group what's inside a Team Liquid I feel like I say to you the one walking away is the happiest team that killed himself the Scuttle crab and now it's happened. Once again maybe looking for a cheap place if you hope to have some sustained chord level 114 liquid speaking about it Lids he makes the past down you recognize is no 7 is available for ss3 teleport back into the lane has changed SK Telecom for the better the more aggressive look after the play 3-peat games on bottom side special to under the tree and then they chase window Vision on to Teddy into the river long enough for kids to get their lease and answers back getting the flash off of ss met you did not have it here that's why the repeat Gates does workout for 20 guests in there with the red box and SK Telecom get some plates off of the bottom turret in addition to the extra kill and I love the decision-making from Petty as well in the moment rather than focusing the jungle bunch baby carrier live a double life knowing that would the hail of blades being a Calista at level one he can force the forests out and with the arrival of Clint they would be likely able to turn into that favors a very good quick decision-making committee care about the expected bottom line Focus we expected a lot to be determined by the stranglers early on and definitely has set them up for Success on the side of SK Telecom Khan also invading to get some more jungle vision for the side of SKT to continue the traffic's missing to be on the bottom side of mid right here possibly in that brush put the drink at Ward himself motorcycle he's sending first three calls come in from the midline of stopping us back recently as well no Sheen done for impact good for sounds white together Jason costume extra ability power and control words that convey keep himself safe pushing the top sites and topside definitely will benefit a lot if that ocean Drake does go over first dragon will be an ocean I cannot just put even more importance on who's going to win the bottom side early fights because that's such a good Dragon Ford games like your little farm backup back off and regenerate you can help you on the outside but but that's Katy having the early advantage and them having the Calista Calio but they're in a very secure spot Malcolm X Play It's Baker and clit come through they got a couple of words unlock those down and dark out some of his vision is ocean Drake to get the Aldi aggressive towards down right here Flint does have kind of control of his bottom river right now he is around but going to be walking through words while doing so shooting star golf right now to quit notice that they do have priority in both of them it is that she ain't even stay stupid it's pretty big and you can see no impact getting jumped a bit low is that, but it's been a good job with kind of pushing around Canton now grab by Bill top winners and we'll see where to find somewhere else to go with papa globo's con was able to steal the Gangplank ultimate before impact himself his level six sometimes in Lane you can get it. Enemies old before they even get it if you push up the minion wave like that in the end in fact also sitting level 604 so action occurring I love that Clint is still hanging around the outside of the map on cool down so with those up and available to take him look for another potential play but also if you want to be a wet in the event of the vintage looking to try and find an opportunity back into the oldest out of the bank and I we talked about how good that could be working quite match up now to be on the side of head case all the time so gone with the stylus to be feeling very good akali can back off your back up in this crowd with addition to an early Vamps after they're just how much does a stain on the side of SK Telecom are feeling very good about those early moments we sauce on the bottom side of the map for SKT is 7 Minute ocean Drake means so much for winning a game that makes a Lenny face almost just fruitless 40 L to try to get to your ass down because the boss lean back and forth that was licking his wounds within 15 CS after a pretty catastrophic early start that deaf interpreter it was very rough and even now look at that out yet again and even more this Farm has different and plate number to does SKC in the bottom lamp to level difference but the fact that he's already level six so devastatingly bought land of the team liquid only level four for double disk on even approach the wave under his own power the deficit continues to mount tools the bought side of the map fortunately it is going well between liquid stop playing also going well we aren't even at 8 minutes into the game and it's already on a one-to-one basis Teddy up over a thousand gold over double if callista getting to the blade of the ruined King quickly here is going to be
