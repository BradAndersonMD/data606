friends as well as in players who have a lot of potential as up-and-comers here right now they have licorice is kind of their big star this guy I think over the last two years in the ALCS has been the best top laner overall in an a note Perry met alongside some of these C9 Academy guys we've seen so many people coming through as two can be great and they're hoping that Johnson and Diamond Powell Foxy's know these guys that are young players obviously. The weather in the LCS are all going to be able to develop and and make this a really strong roster last year afro is going to be the primary care to bring up these other players fake God in Philly go play together on both Air Academy debuts now the rain here back on the LCS stage you know they put a few games and alongside asked who had Pinot Neo now of course you only had a very good game as well and right away I was also one of thepoints of dignitas the other player kept around from last year did early big potential for a very quick picks already has been so high priority in ProFlame bar in the new season 20 21 no really strong especially in comparison alongside a lot of these Harding age before that we're seeing in the bed I were seeing a lot of Lyon overseeing Alistar even things like Ralph who can actually set up for you to dive in and utilizing gale-force it does seem to work very well for that aggressive play Renekton plus Thalia Point click CC for the Thalia to fling you in with that seismic Chef that is very dangerous for any top layer that is going to be going up against them so fly Quest already going to have to try to decide do they want to try to play towards and match has to be too or you just going to sacrifice licorice hope that he can survive as best we canto be over all of you if he was picked up at the 4th but you got to find a way to answer and survive Renekton to Leah bruculino Fighters will do so you probably play a tank I want a nice things about being or awful during the Duffy which means you can if you and the Tulia shop every other CC will still land you'll still be done if you can still be flown or silenced they'll still kind of take effect but you will not be knocked in Viera push back sew safer ant if you can go for a licorice his wife being the guy who currently want to be on a carry at your foot against one of these Jungle Top Lane combos that can just destroy you you're not going to have a fun time on a lot of turtle now finding out quite a few of these supports galio certainly hasn't played as it before in this season no point click c c r a for Kaiser but it's also very strong force in the RSO training bands back and forth your Alistar is band out as well fly quest to ahaven't been out to Yahoo just been popular in 10 pairs well with the Leah to build a play heavily towards pop side of this does live leave Leona up for flyquest if they wanted to try to play to Ward that so it will be interesting to see if that does get faded out but didn't cost at least for now not too worried about it yeah when you see what the match up to going to be here of course you know support and midlane are the roles left off in this but I do something funky and thin rice per second do flyquest going to be looking at Palafox pick maybe and maybe she'll be saving their support for last time ticks and it could be a very very obvious team fight composition Oriana likely will lose the Leona over here to aphromoo that is one of those really high priority pics down in the bottom Lane work incredibly well with Samira point-and-click PC with that stunt American Odyssey follow up with the Nock up on NECC targets with can set up for all in very very effectively and you own a again here find out what Diamond wants now they have given him last pic and so we're have to see where he take us as far as the supporters' go Rel I really like it has been out quite a lot of it works both had to peel an egg age you can be a follow-up on the Oregon gauge you can also dive in and one of things have been really unique with the Kaiser combo is that you can apply the plasma with your alternator with some sort of CC like a flying over top 5 Second dive in and then on that same ability to fly the flag of the ultimate is also kind of peeling for Kaiser once she is altered in because you had that little man pulling them in and helping to protect a boar hurt the first downs of this really really exciting for Sorella the LCS I am very high for it I really thought it was well I'm glad you're basically ever he was doing go for a 2012 Challenger 2013-2014 took a break for a few years came back with the scouting grounds 2017 from their bam on Siena Academy be like one of those came back while I'm glad to see you finally get his shot on the LCS Asian glad he's going to be the one originating Darrell here in the LCS also it's going to be fun watching the one side of course you really got you Leona Gravesend Kaiser login look really good on the flak Westside outside though it's still looking pretty spicy as well I mean you've got you and I we had some hits and misses from Perks like he got first blood and then it kind of fell off from there but two very good lanes for a Tulia to gang Kavanaugh Rihanna's pretty squishy has no inmate escape so just like the Q3 from unit that's a setup that's a guaranteed kill if you don't flash it so there's a lot going on in this game very aggressive very exciting Sidelines the one side and an obvious team fight comp on the other we are on to the rift here for game 4 of the day has ticket office flyquest are going to Duke it out to be a good one I'm very excited for it as you say but you're going to have that obvious team by cop on one side on the other other r a lane that they can try to play through very aggressively I don't think so they can get out into a 131 and pretty comfortably with this style of composition you have TP as opposed to ignite that we sell pork steaks or so legal in fake God could be looking to play towards the side lengths half. Rocks moving around the map roaming with aphromoo trying to create pressure you also can have you know dardoch Neo and 1/2 remove your kind of holding down Bent Lane as the three in that 131 so I do think that there's a lot of ways for them to play this out but when you are going to be South compositions it to it depends largely on you doing well in laying right you're playing slow push from behind is incredibly hard because the winning team by team will just show up two objectives and constantly forced air force you to respond or just fall further and further behind so we're gonna have to see how well they can talk and laying up against like was to you have so many great ways to set up here and I talked about the relka the combo but also real set up incredibly well pulling people together with the magnetism on the ultimate for orianna shockwaves you have great long-range engaged both with a r l is Wells the Orange Soap really really deadly double Marksman see if I can come up here not going to be the red leash as expected there and garlic is in a kite down towards frogs this is also to expectation last hits it down burn from your jungle item does not kill Buffs and so by waiting at my second saves a full-on attack which is that going to half and at them having a faster clear so nicely done by getting a chicken's here is going to be slower released plus it's Thalia she has this really really absurd single Target Camp clear so that is going to be a jungle leave for dr. Leon we'll see how it manifests you talk about laundry once I wanted to bring something up bushes I definitely think compelling as well which is it going to be a lot on co2 keeps the engagement from happening as Samira because if you could stop Oriana's keep you from being like a ball for being in rain still in shock from hitting either so either because the timer engaged couples are all stuff by Neo kind of doing the blade swirl that well it can be extremely powerful but if you can force that out you know even just a little bit of Chip damage or no threatening with AQW from the Oriana then there is a fairly lengthy cooldown that you can look at finest with you or an LT or some other form of the gay so I agreed you I was going to have to be good with that really tracking cooldowns of his opponents and making sure that you're not wasting at w by any means this is going to be like a lot of pressure on him to be playing well you know you talked about aphromoo & Johnson obviously playing against his former teammate afro and Johnson I think were not the brightest spot really for didn't often in what was a top split your previously they became of pretty darn strong pot Lane afro they're going to be hoping that he can again no playing alongside Neo here get something similar performance-wise out of him you know as what he did from Johnson and if they can train him open and become a pretty powerful to be doing that bottom side if Sally go and fake God can really develop alongside Dart off then thing to start working for dignitas but if there are really tough to the LCS this split it is definitely one of the teams that people are expecting the last from that are going to be hard pressed to enter to really match up against all these very top teams going to happen recently finished drop by about 3:10 and had the chance to go for Scuttle instead look around topside so if it award and took down the first half of drugs but in what do you want most is on the small minion and then you just saved me 1200 damage and I still got most the gold we take those and honestly I'm not sure I feel like he doesn't least I mean it might be a situation where he was getting a little bit nervous about his positioning on the map and it takes a little bit away he still Sandra tree back and he did take that Scott also hopefully for him he's going to go to pick up more of these camps afterwards. Looking to put a little bit of pressure here does this amount so we'll back it up but no with Alex around they was happy to take any fight if it did break out play nothing happened right now you got a 12:00 CST to the topside us because going to take his first recall the game Palafox happy to get here picked up to there as well honestly any first recall for any man I can just pick up to your vulva tear upgrade to a few of them the two of them very very good so pretty, to see that won't happen events at his house functionally infinite Mana once every call comes through and you buy that for when I go buy them they'll Palafox going to have a lot of push priority already had a farm leave so that it forces you don't feel like driving to email and then I kept and not getting any up some self just yet finally matched it so you can see a difference as he finally goes back to his first two items down there goes a call when you're just getting constantly poked out in her early on to cool. They're very long for you and I so it can be difficult if you can't actually threaten any sort of all day and you have to pick up much is Dan yet you can get bullied in these matchups how to staunch the bleeding no keep it dies a little bit more even from here on out we'll see what his first by was just going on. Send these spells from Palafox and you'll be able to move around the map country little bit better I already woke support back in the lane now is they help NX I pick up the first dragon the game no flyquest so far so good you noticed that the jungle on The Blacklist start do you want to be around bottom line in time at 5 minutes to make sure you play for the dragon make sure that lane stay safe since Rell and Leona could be such a volatile late as we seen Dark Side of bottom side bangs for round two of the drugs but now there is an engage Liquors wants then they will not find what is licorice classified his own stunts. To actually help to deal with a Thalia so even though you have that armor you're still fairly squishy against actual do loved our talk and fake goddess loc knows that it's hot winter still has priority does get his flash Force but happy to move in invade to Legal have pushed out mid so they have priority their Palafox and looks like was on a recall or perhaps just a little bit more defensively back so a nice little bit of a play up around that top side of Durock at least as far communicating and playing pretty well you have to stay with his sole length as well Flash the flash on for Johnson was afraid of two senators from Africa put on rock and they didn't get the flash out as you say but it is a trade afro though is going to be 6 here pretty soon and McClendon flash down on Johnson there is the potential for an all-in play and I would like to see them look to attack that event Summoners down on Johnson see if they can get a kill their especially because know when you're playing this style of bottling is Diggs how to really do I want to be playing from ahead senior in particular you're in my experience it is is a marksman that can feel Unstoppable when she picks up a couple kills but largely feels pretty ineffective and just kind of worried even form style games yes what you guys are primary builds are right using the or the early components of shieldbow I think you have options kind of everywhere but she'll do is the most common because everything you do. Supplies lifesteal so it's a really good stat for her but if you're going to get one shot by you know what grades are in Ariana's like you can't lie still while dead so you know you do you have to be somewhat ahead is your mentioning right uniform doesn't make you the hard carry it's the first shut down and suddenly now you're going to feel good about your damage behind everyone else is based on
