how to get to the better of this foot so far though yeah for sure I mean that last time around we we had the matchup even in rivalry week at CSM took that one as well since then they made some changes you into the bottom way and I think you'd look really good for DSM I'm moving up from their icademy roster performing quite well with double if so we'll see how well they can navigate the gank this time around cuz that was one of the big things I remember from passing the first one weekly he cleared award and then still got off a successful gank heading towards bottom side like two seconds later even with TSM Vision let's see if they can track the enemy don't go a little bit better this time around pretty standard bad so far away from doublelist in TSMyou see a lot more the flex fix screen Target to hear 2nd round purse that Vale to shampoo the case right there of course we're expecting to have an early game lead overall he looked like a player go to print says it's you bring them across the Templars of game is TSM TSM psmt is it okay for plants pretty well and that's kind of the way they never shake out right now so we'll see if seals you can step up your game these teams are only three get the part in the standings if the last couple weeks ago well if he's healed you could pass them it is possible Right candidate is the iPass work in the field that that is a possibility if they can play with you well we're singing it is Diovan another chance we are seeing increased involvement in the matter of course we've seen somebody there is fence that champ is gone and so was I have for 3 tomorrow to ask you to pull the arrow exactly it's the old and they are the feathers and layingI am to the matchups put there ever been a couple as well in ltk and LPL into you know asriel and he's in The Misfortune as on top of it but they are way from doublelift kind of pushing him towards the Azrael which he does not have a place on the champion actually summer Adderley airbag inflate exactly three Champions counting from one of senna good night dance place before the split this is number nine right there and don't get me wrong but if it is Botley you have a lot of pushing a lot Polk and waterproofing yeah it's also really stayed away from the Azrael and in recent memory now Korea obviously they both had a lot of place on the champion Diantha All-Stars highlight clip where he gets a pentacle with Ezreal so I'm sure he still has the fingers for it on the other side for CLG though they get wetGraves very safe jungler here to be backed up by galio most players like playing Graves trying to Oak View's your early range advantage and a lot shuttle crab fight a lot of aggressive lose looking to arrest their opponents either taking phase rush and then having sommerfeldt ignite a lot of the time or even I've seen a couple you'll cleanses and stuff if your feet are freezing PC second grade games that has been on take duty free much full-time he has german-speaking like really low. Is he is there trying to be like the facilitator for the team but he's incredibly incredibly low gold share in the late game he had a daughter could all sticks and pulled out there and it's up to those two to carry as we just saw door lock on Dick the top a couple game to go do you really want to see Graves take out of the farm getfolding jungler and be one of the best things are factors in teamfights light games we will be a yes I am going to be on tanked let us play around if I go to diagnose I want to see that style I want to let him go do that and play robot Linx procedure make a difference and see if I liked it a lot of podcast more conservative place are the Reds tanks or or safer play he did have the Wukong game yesterday I had a pretty good match up there and was able to have a really good performance I think he's had some of his games overall do on tanks in Oran and Poppy specifically so happy to see him on that they do wisely band at the Camille they don't want to let ruin have a twitching often they also don't want to let theLeo Carrillo combination go through there are still others foot twitching options you can take if you wanted to open that up when they are one of the ones in the patch was a bunch of the extra attack speed in the mini form when you get your hop off and you can try and use that to whittle down or need you harass him after trying to avoid the combo and kind of hard. Fort warned to get his Pitbull brutal proc combo off on our because of the evasiveness and actress fee that you get one or otherwise a lot of Fighters even things like Ken and sonar is more of ruined still going his way I don't know if you could really get ink for car into orange overalls on other lightsa client with Ash Graves only difficulty is armor stacking for your fault line is going to be effective is Cassiopeia Browns on a team flight top 40 SF I love this in the galley I wanted to see it more as well as been to be the best performer on the entire team for TSM now he's got the power in his hands in Gallia you can really abused that match of the poison to my asthma is really good at stopping any sort of the opportunities to create plays for I'm within the mid lane off of Weakley moving around through the jungle you know you were trying to use your Graves matchup it's pretty easy for Grace giant Dodge Charger viniq use Galileo classic try and get that ultimate down on him early to back up those invades ash brown on the bottom side even allows you to go for level 1 invades so that's what I want to see from c o g they need to use this champ select from the very beginning toearly Wards down deep into the jungle maybe even go for a steal away on one of the bus and and try and use that to snowball there early game plan ahead alright well I'm going to be really important and very soon here as CLG npsm do battle counter logic gaming their friend a hold on their upper bracket birth in playoffs they have Team opponent's team's right behind them looking to steal a spot away drop in the lower bracket of course that's before that we just talked to yell when they still got a lot of work cut out for them 2 and 1/2 games behind a playoff bye with 5 to play it can't be done but it's going to be difficult a win against the LG of course it's a step towards that we are on a trip let's see how it goesyeah TSM have a lot of good scaling options Cassiopeia obviously is going to be a monster should have a pretty pretty good Lane as well as being able to get a death cap upgrade later on for broken plate if they make it that far so you see TSM playing defensively they are working already and watching openings for that level one that I was trying to Shield me to go for the even go as far as to Ward red and blue for themselves as they're really worried about it and weekly going to start on the blue side still does have the option to go for it but the early alert systems to think good for TSM trying to avoid any of these scenarios in which carbon starting red you can even have the super cheesy like level to you you risked a lot when you do this against the graves Graves can punish you at Levi stealing away camps in a bit even afterwards but it does have the option there were you have CP at level two kind of rare for most jungle championsnot really quickly write both technically don't pass for the Jarvis negative armor on Red Bluff make that pretty easy grade finishing up flu and they going on the graphing a second shouldn't be too far behind but really really early harassed york-penn both Washington case there's a flash Auto he wouldn't have lived otherwise posted felt a little bit late gives himself the thumbs down to that is immediate claim Kingdom 40th yeah that's why I can't like I was like I really wanted to see this more into the prevalent galio but person abuses it even harder than I thought he was going to be able to fuse it half of that for his poisoned Chase's of dad who is that stalker chasing pobelter back through the lane and forces this double Summoners absolutely insane yorkson let me just even talk further about him because he hasn't been up and down your today's been so good for them extremely consistent he has the most solo kills with any player in the LCS right now on the team as well and it would Cassiopeia having this goodstart burning both Summoners maybe with a juggler like Jarvis you can even see some extra pressure coming through I would definitely highly recommend it currently no warts on the top side so piercing goes up to that side to make sure they get first vision and that will give them some areas to try punish and Friends hope out there big wave building here as well I will bitterly damage down there Has Broken Blade going to fight of the top light and wave ruin of course counterpick in the match up with Fleet footwork to keep his boobs be sustained solid and she stay away from those pillows not get knocked up right now no more control for either toppling anywhere near topside roof that's down probably that right now is fika with your first win the fight at sing spell peace Retreat you probably got to get a lot of folks down you want to keep the man to pull up so you can keep going for the shots you like it at throat a fair bit of work but don't go to the more defensive option ROM Ash can run you down and I'm always fine with him going to fence it when it specially as a mid-length galio that you're facing so you're like a decent chance we get some board members down here in the bottom side with you with a scrub set up but I definitely feel you want you'll try to play offensive Lee as well in and buying extra gold going to rest meat goes out in the item higher it's a good 20 or so more ability Power by mid to late game at that matter right it can be a good teammate or not we're killing it be Champion regardless though we have some look towards topside is the key was down for broken play the bad apples bit short because here there is a gank he's kind of Duty sticking around another word comes down for real because okay will a top pressure I can get some relief site see you on graves pretty threatening so spend some time since I don't wear your safety be stuck in the wave see you later yeah it's hard for days rest Graves who Dodges the EQ unless you act like you ain't got a fog of War something or you get a really nice one good surprised the grace is going to run circles around you and chase you down real hard on the exit do you have to play after laner tier for the drive-in and Main Lena right now obviously Purex in being able to get his phone early Advantage we could try to keep this in for him but quickly is going to definitely pull further and further ahead in the farm since because spending so much time just trying to track he's been tracking weekly on weekly side of the map where he's getting answer while speaker is falling too far behind in CS go back to Liang it's right up I ruined looks like this normal to make the same kind of choice then she like that in any low-impact Lane going to Russia call items and just go into your real deal from there so it could have been picked up the build towards Black Cleaver no surprises there in the olden days we saw things like one of the ruined King and raise blade in Fanta Fanta hair that's probably not the option here but who's going to feel real good probably going to be a Teen Titan Go for him and it go for the big stars on to Cassiopeia get through the back like on a crack them with the galio on top should be able to get it no problem they had slain pressure as well as bottom land you'll recall there for counter logic gaming and speakers definitely go to be behind in the 1 verse 1 verse praise but you're not really trying to take those one first one we mentioned before trying to be a team enabler what's a busy to me is actually TSM has the lowest first dragon rate in the LCS despite being a team around bottom Lane and the fact that I would say he's been eating pretty well overall has solid gold install XP leads a good later they've never been able to pick up those objectives very off at this time around though they will get that one little bit of kind of pressure right now for CLG is the cargo sent back to bake pick up some more Mana regen in this game pieces be picked up here as well and might mean a recall can come before too terribly long upgraded boots for 6 a.m. he's he's going to wait around for a while and ultimately it's just the farming era of Ezreal where you get your tear your call just trying to last it charge up your Mana item here no problem and wait to grow into the two core item real big carry used here roughly on cool but you want the faster the better that comes online on the same time as you green upgrade that's going to feel to be good and out of the power respect is not always exactly gold gated right it's reloaded to make sure using to you after he's a time and everything else toppling still a bit of a broken plate holds the fart lead with four minutes even to kill so really feeling good with this one right he hasn't really had any intention from guitar pick up for now done yeah how to see in the next 2 minutes Air Force EOD is some looks with the galley open Spellbook switch over to ignite he's got flash ignite this galio is ready to kill level 6 this is where you want to start seeing the force come through Wiggly's already got the level Leon Graves they are looking for with your grave starving match up sticks sticks off that crap though so he's going to have a few more options. Even if they do you go for the invite but the play still the same looking for the set Up Stix he's got his ass Cheryl you can get your
