of course we are here I am free cuz they'll is there and feel she is facing a dignitas and I'm excited to see what happens vlg what they were tied for second early on there still 5 and 5 which is over the Lord has over four times vipers KDA in the LCS right now I'm obviously also in my tire went right so they can do right at the base. For a swimming sperm adult baby diapers really been improving you know maybe they feel like he picks up their issues is going to offer them something against these team and we have heard the nlss talking about the fact that the LG don't we focus on topside at all maybe to your house wants to do without Focus graphite I think by will be suited better for that it's all speculation but at the end of the day we will find out what is going to happen there. They did have a good starta but to be fair you know their losses are all against kind of the top teams right so it is just had a schedule waited more towards the second half you know when you look at their three straight losses to actually close up first round robin with TLT attempting I write that it to the top three teams DSM you arguably third or whatever or depending on what your current power rankings are things are shifting around a lot but we three of the hardest teams in the league be lost through all of them are fairly unsurprisingly so I do think that they they've been relatively par for the course you know that they were beating team kind of below them in the standings are losing teams above them in the standings so we'll see if they can actually do make more of a surge in the second half try to challenge those games that are sitting Atop A like this ish play Steve are in middle of the pack being consistently beating as you mentioned teams are better than them which I'm curious if they think that's because they kept the sameroster from Spring split bar in the steps to confirm last week and you will find 5 teen boys to go around 9 and 9:00 or 10:00 and 8 which is obviously like two or three times as good as well but is that good enough for them do they want to retire I look for that world spot everyone says yes but is that realistic I'm kind of curious what's in their mind either way as we go further into the draft Ashley coming atop CR80 Carrie picked up going over to Johnson we have seen set games from bike rack for the top played in fact is shampoo in the LCS is fully you know top claim damage Focus fighter so we made me dig at you mentioned play around topside Viper open think could also go to Doc theoretically could go to Port but I don't really expected you paired alongside match would make that much sense but I do actually really love the pic I think it's fully blind pickable doesn't really have any Mastiffs that I think are on Sanibel that can actually deal with it in that bottom Lane they help out jungle and it puts you when you are against you know I really kind of jungle focused style draft which I think a lot of the gravesScott's really are you know they often become about Ken Gray Zeki bully around your jungler can he be no counter jungling in your face constantly getting advantages in that way and act and help you. That quite a bit using hot shot to scout out when you don't know where the grace is so you're done working avoid them if they already to 72 matchup definitely case could be a lot of very very good obviously I think I can stay on that one is Over Yonder is locked in for Phoenix 3 Midland band support with Ashley Zoe's Hatfield you grab her right away so it is filled you haven't you blind pick their mid later dignitas get the opportunity to counter pick for toppling leaving that set at the flex be hard-pressed to have either stolen have we not know it will be interesting to see what they can actually show up then we take the bus is coming off of the two a week as we were talking about earlier was very impressive but one of the things that peopledetracting from that was both wins world Phoenix on this year right and we need to see him perform on more champions from that he didn't look as drawing on the Morgana and and definitely did not have a good game Auntie F so now bring you another new Champion here for him in the LCS will be if he can actually have a stronger game I do always loved it the Oriana paired with some sort of hard engaged and I wonder if we're going to get that something may be like you know a nautilus or even at work on or just some sort of way to actually have that go button to set up the Shockwave how can often make it much more effective I think it's actually against someone like do Eli crave Champions acne with that hard engage you can vary off and lock down and can be really really powerful pairing with the only hard to get deported after always played this split is Leona otherwise he's a lot of threats aren't they can engage but they're not I put my body in Champions typically so Bard is the second most it goes for it yet again so that is the one right set can a champion is and thenwell within the Shockwave but that is the only good Target on dig right now we'll see what it ends up being as last remain flexible in top jungle we haven't seen dark play NLCS yet we know he can play it throws not that hard to learn sat dongle and so will see that was filled you must have guitar player knowing it might be sent might be something else and going to say yeah enjoy the orang I'm pretty surprised by the Cannon Dam from CLG to be honest cuz when steak has been malphite you know that that is a matchup that you would want to play Canon 220 to me that didn't actually signify that they were looking to play the champion Canon also what is totally fine for Warren it's something that you can kind of withstanding the early game and it's become more relevant later on so surprised by that but the Canon Dan would suggest they think that the Top Lane has yet to be picked for Viper I do think that bharatiya knows though it is not taxable to me and then Shockwave off of me you can set up in a similar way with the ultimate you know if you hit an ultimate on to Zoe on her grave than on any of these carries Phoenixtimer 12 Contessa ball on top of them while they are in the safest and in time the Shockwave right as they're coming out of that bar at altamed and I can be quite effective yeah definitely can't be good be fun to see if that coordination works out give or take the toss that you mention it as they all sealed he does not play around top play true it is on an island and what is island of a Viper on the Raven we saw it before they could not get the win against the others are saying we're going to try this one again and this time around I think it's a lot more successful Viper is notably an amazing Rhythm player and this is Beth Champion by far-right you know all of all of my first best game you think of our on the ribbon he's had some incredible carry performances and I do like the substitution if this is your plan going forward if you really want to focus if it is specifically targeted towards a team that doesn't like to play around Top Lane now the question to me becomes if you're sealed you can you adapt right can you prevent the snowball up on that top side where it is not always the easiest Champion to actually snowball on but it mean if if he is constantly getting focused consoling getting to be one know he is going to be put in a bad situation and that's going to potentially allow a Viper on this room to take over the game so we have to see Ken weekly help to protect ruin up there and they shut down this ribbon because room from behind is pretty worthless generally that the LCS level especially when you're looking at some of these carries which are pretty difficult actually take down you know you have obviously have a Grace who can become relatively Tanki Israel with the death dance ice-born type build you know a lot of these guys are going to be able to itemize pretty effectively against that ribbon so you generally have to play from head yeah I will say though in watching vipers games on riven's so far I haven't seen him need to dominate Lane to be absurdly effective in teamfights the man has at least 20,000 games on Riven at this point in his League of Legends career that means he will find those open to mid-game he will find the Byzantine fight and he'll be equal to the Bourne and then do three times the crowd control of damage in the team fight the damage sure you expect but like the man will find a 4-person flash cunoc up and you be like guess she's in the cage tank now I do not want to understate this he has been having a hard time donating else yes yes even doing very well in Academy either he's got a negative goal-difference there as well but on the rivet it just hits different the man will find opening in mid-to-late game into my eyes are always going to be on this for the play Make Em expecting at least one highlight reel clip in this game from him will it be enough to beat CLG I do not know but it's going to be a fun game to watch all the same and I like to call out of of the the key flash right you know because I do think that ribbon when it comes to the inviting Riven with flashes is basically a separate champion from women without Flash in a room without flashing a team fight as really going to struggle to actually ever get on top of these carries to walk through the Nautilus in the orne you know with with the amount of damage that is actually required to be able to break down some of these carries you have to get on top of them instantly before you are getting your knock down yourself so your timing a flash becomes incredibly important against the Revenant I do think that you know that was one of the areas that and we saw Kumo fall short on when he actually went to the Revenant think the lady face went great you know the coordinated well with the jungalow they pull up Dives but it is much more difficult to actually team fight on Riven I think that is where you can often see kind of those highlight plays come out from the true truven one-trick style player the people look so many damn thing and they can land the combos perfectly factually first one down is going as expected blue bus routes were both sides Wiggly leashless where is Johnson. Faraci team players and give Darla Cadillacs of time there so early start is going to be nice for such a great lady bipolar II by the white chunks gets down but look that is what you do on level 1 you drop some help pack. Is a phoenix take the most absurd trade you would like it's okay you got 350 Health waiting right behind you yes it hurts the early landing on Barge if you want to learn a second point in queue at level three major without magical journey but end of the day it is going to allow Phoenix to feel a lot more comfortable in that mid-length that is really nice but honestly you know I don't think that's a trade you want to take with those help back there or not it was a pretty poor afraid I'll be down his boss I did you get level 2 first then I forgot to be careful now you know it is one of those situations where it's like a it's essentially a potion and 1/2 righty 2004 like 7075 on the setup that they do actually take with it the runes and masteries a charge but you know what does she have the extra potion that have which is very very valuable you still want to try to have the extended trades are chipping away at someone a pole vaulter is actually just playing crafting potions a very likely Time Warp tonic to hear and he's going to have a lot of sustained so I will see if he needs to actually keep the wave away from is Tourette because in those types of situations get advantage of those extra Phelps Ryan you need to keep them from pushing even fully and resetting otherwise you know it's not going to matter if you have a couple more potions in the bag when he goes back to base spell thief seminar use right there. Otherwise yeah I know big problem there early gold lie cuz Lane put it in those size right now you got ruin of the very big c s Lee but look at that it's 15 million for life or to kill what even drop it in the mail if they are Easy Auto couple accused he's using ketchup in farm no problem maybe once in the middle and got really nearby as well as why not to bring the flash gets away from the little bit of the damage does FTP to burgundy. Too much difficulty was able to avoid the sleep you know that would have been a death sentence if he did actually got tagged with it but still that is a great gang from Sea algae it's not like we believe that any time waiting around you just going to walk straight through mid lane on his way to work spot and shut it shut up and listen or sometime get the flash out they didn't expend any Summoners whatsoever so I think looking very good for this graves in the early stages you can actually put Kleenex even further behind it gives Graves more abilities play crest of flame or ability to invade we could put Bellfort and then control that midline in be there as backup if you actually need them and so far the lanes are all equal basically identical CS across all roles that stop playing scraps briefly fees it damage of a viper gets grasped back but does he is a damaged over to ruin all the same as do you recall and TP came through for Phoenix recall and TP comes to purple halter he's got spell books are going to be a real Summoner before too terribly long anyway and very similar buys on both sides boot portable doran's Ring versus a lot of really posting that crap thing on the football field. What are the premier room choices in Pro play you can see that ribbon is actually just having to go back to base do with the Wavin you know he didn't actually want to risk fully pushing it in the way of will eventually come back toward them because it was over closer to ruin our backup faster over there and eventually push back but you could see you know if he stays around you are in that kind of position because any time as a top laner wood right outside of your opponent's Detroit you're struggling to get that way pushed in your so simple the gangster so acceptable to roane's and my room is going to have to respect the potential of that but is able to get the fault if your Smite was used early play wiggly wiggly lose the big chicken. Krabs it flashes the flares and thanks very much that's mine good sleep on a phoenix as is reasonable damage the man is coming to listen or the out of Mana you think I'm a very hard time admitting he's been keeping up on a farm for the health bar betrays how close that lane is going to do that this is kind of problematic now though that he is actually out of Mana he can stay around now but you could be losing a lot of them sure he would like to try to wait around as long as he can to recall on a Canon waves we lose his less if possible but he has a passport for the first time second time when you go back to face know if you base that A4 timing you're just losing those menu for falling behind experience then it does allow me to get a lot harder to last hit some of the minions under Tower when you don't have any manner when you're completely reliant on just Auto attacks you know there are some minions are going to be awkward help mountsin and they can be finished with all those girls are allowed in a bid for the magical Journeys already there 6 a.m. get back to Lane suppressor put the fear of 6 and 1 both want the damage of level 6 set which is not going to be in a whole lot get some damn it you know what something down there but it's not going to be in a whole terribly time good thing for a coz that weighs the boob has happened
