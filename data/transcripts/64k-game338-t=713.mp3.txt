you have 30 seconds of peas to ban Champion so let me get a quick overview how to terminate draft works so the two teams by players per team and you draft the Champions you can see on the screen here there's a list of 576 Champions must build a floaty play League of Legends this is the current live build - orianna orianna is not available but all the rest of champion on the balance changes the Skins all available to use into the way this works if you're playing competitive play in this tournament you can ban out Champions so you can get three bands you can see a collie and left hand side rumble on the other these teams are Banning out shampoo for the other team and end their own team can't play them they're they're not eligible to play in that game all these changes give it up to three you do a new set of band after each team Band 3 Champions going to pick cycle AAA will pick one and it will take two and we'll go 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 is there but the point is you take turns picking your 5 champion and you can see that they are there saying you know I love seeing these targeted vanthe North American Service is known for playing at all he's an incredibly strong Macaulay player and he's a rebel the chain is known to be so strong in the European servers that don't exist barely ready to play in now. Do it. That was that right there so the band got one more thing I going to do with that Rumble going to park at Dan Nunu is it is a very Smuggler and the Twisted Fate the very last dance from epic so if you spell that lets him do a lot of damage to a single Target usually jungle minions and got flash as well just a good summer to spell for positioning it lets you move about a third of the screen wherever you want across the map and it was a very a position based champion from going to push into the location are you see the the early pics of Epic R jahna in vain vain arranged Harry physical damage than Champion dejana a great babysitter and support for physical damage to the shoetotally blocked him if it gives you going as damages well and veins going to really love having that and one of these League of Legends about when you pick a chance will you pick Summoner spells which means the UFC as a player have two of roughly 12 you can pick and no matter what can you have you can cast those spells on on my route to Long Cool Downs that do cool things with flash teleport to you ghost makes you run faster point for bills location on the map look at more of these pics and carpets in early pick as well as very strong Mage pick him but it's very smart made with magic damage and contrast to going to be doing Champion as well as you can pin targets down in a location and then carjacked adjust belt on those guys into a constant cost of damage can we see that they take me to school to Norway a big guy 80 Cari Champion news going to be played out lieWarrick that weather August. We have three flashes on the point out real quick just in case draft so you're picking in the order they joined the game but you can swap your Champions Run at the end so it is that you're working out really well we're dyrus probably will be playing physical Carrie and Dan did actually is the jugular for the team and solves is the Mage player picking up Auntie but you might see some options for example of The clairvoyants Misfortune is nothing about you ever seen played a ranked game Sofitel Define support he's got the clear ones locked in he's going to swap with a yellow star is probably the range carry play for this game and end up going to ruin things going on thereafter a y o t n Out against all authority take that final to fix ons do they have the first one and yellow stop will be taken Soraka so they believe main support against all authority in Yellowstone actually inches laying there just got nothing on me second position actually in the insole of rank you but I know one of them Wicked from SK SF some time to concentrate last year. $100,000 up for grabs top team $50,000 to split amongst your team have the money here on Tuesday Morning giant giant shark bigger than be worth a lot of money and little glass be fixed and now it's irelia to pick upis an age waiver the TM like I could run a little bit Rusty of European lineups kind of like her being in a continent but generally speaking so as a mage player he is one who plays me to leave when he's up there usually plays the Mages so help me with the yellow star into dust mop sweeper entertaining commentary of course talk about swapping Champions put the final pick for epic Gaming West rice is one of those ranged a d players as well I have seen these guys run double damage has great they're going to grab say I'm super happy to see that I was going to be on the same as soon as I go to swap I'm sorry I'm having a family meeting right now this is great. I'm just going to tell you a little bit on the usual team definitely a lot more I guess you know if America what a great Champion for me to watch I see my email as wellrunning around it is like waiting people died to me but we have the garbage find another place to set up runes and masteries and swap they received who's not taking that Soraka entire isn't done soon as I know what you want babe I love watching things you do so many stupid things that are hilarious pussy Glover's back those are going down runs out of the poison Trail and we can catch him he's he's the most hilarious Champion I'm waiting arms around his great Mercy Center devil is going to be staying all support is a fairly well-known blitzcrank player the North American mountain with a tank if you got citizen work to hold that Frontline either got the nice crowd control from and he's going to be pretty safe is going to be here if you look at it again. Until we saw in the European qualifiers Moma playing a very very solid game in the mid lane and I'll just leave this time playing golf this one of those Champion to you always havebe aware of when you think you've escaped without little bit of metal burned all of a sudden your desk and usually three maybe four of you as well if it has lucky because well over on the other side as he said double-a going for the support role this unusually may be playing there a little bit more cranky of that will see West fry something to play with you Bane going to have to come out very very strong on at Barton Lane Foley and Sam Esports you continue running as well as I was able to be played by itself to asking because of the great great battle between honey and Noma kalyana Belton moment here but maybe a little bit less North American players have been adopting the European play style of running a support was arranged very bottom of a maid that usually take a guy up Top Lane and independent European Standard for lifeyou're so they've been doing that for quite some time and it took it up as a reason they going to make a place to realize this is a better position now some carries can take us to Corky's one of those examples of guy who can actually so we'll talk when is chilling be fine if you can actually see double a double Kerri lamp beside actually North American Qualifiers were epic they had bought it at the store. But they also had Corky on top so you can't even those devil But Here We Go the game is up in loading screen here we can see Triple-A their faces on speed right now talking to you about talking with themselves getting the house ready looking at December smells the line up the Skin's all that fun stuff ready to go very soonbut yeah the lineups and I'm looking at this energy here and AAA has a great area that competition it got a name has ultimate they've got a lot of misfortunes ultimate dropping tons of damage out there and you could go to the game his actual I want to see that the blue team the green healthbars AAA let's go guys all right in here we are in the game to be following the yellow star on road warrior Miss Fortune Cookies real quick right now.. Ready for dream happy of yellow star creeping up and rest of the team and you can see I think is right there to drop the word of this Brush review real quick to see just what they want so they don't really see AAA running around just yet we we drop that backed out and I got to get used to keyboard I'm sorry I'm a little bit slow in the commands the first day or so I've been eating name of the anime jungle Andover Way at the top AAA scared actually afraid of getting a new front tire it there their they're take their own Golem right here look at me pretty much safe to have taken over the red Bob and they're going to jump into the brush you and me to go to spawn in 20 seconds of the Nutri monsters was fun then and it looks like a freaking better place to store Patrol this game right now going to take something is wrong come on inside a fully but it was a pretty big bang the really amazingly aggressively out to phone list all this woman that's still hung around and go to st. John's University. Playmore I just don't answer those rates for the first day of it. Take away from against all authority jungle right now the more it's going to help them a little bit later on clouds are going to read to you maybe a little bit dangerous going to go to West rice and they're going to be leaning against the Red Top vein that is not what you want to fight against of your AAA right now so they have a good chance that the sealer of Soraka and they're coming out of his fortune is she going to be okay but already exhaust down as well but I'll take it exhaust to waste a flat that's really good for them right now so that's why I got the good open traffic right here with great position is lost from dunnedin to really expect that fly straight over the top and I couldn't really do so much damage in there probably could have something a little bit interesting about to take off here with all the money will go into Darkness Darkness put me in a little bit of trouble game cell phones at health potion to get into a place like home so that's how I ask for things even in terms of that another Johnny between toenail youngboy really rental from FX really going to set it apart I think it is a release date yet but we still waiting around and he's he's maybe unfortunately I'm not quite sure the aggression of bottom it is pretty strong but the Rockets giant fuel rewards can they still safe inside the trip on most of these guys and airports that way about pretty much safely up and comes out Johnny going to start roaming and this could be us some damage to pull back and look at the dragon see that it's safe and looks like the Christ haven't heard it for now that's it one of the great things about seems you know you think okay we can get in there on to him and he throws you behind you've got to tell her I grow on you and you just have to run away all really Rick yourself in that one officer. So it's a really nice place to go and pick up that sell the Extra Innings rocks and Roots looks like I got me some slot on your nipple buybuybaby dismiss it in Auckland great recipes pushing around Moma right now that's not to work too well for him to take him some time to get back up. So I don't know if I'm going to keep up with this night is a 26 of them out so quickly play the one not freshman on against all authority and there's the aggressive words with qu checking out face check that brush with it with impunity and know that no one is there by about three hundred gold so far globally on the team's they're getting some slight advantage of themselves just ever-so-slightly Brooklyn 670 favor of Yellowstone in baseball 2017 cheat at Red Hook being picked up by White Stripes.
