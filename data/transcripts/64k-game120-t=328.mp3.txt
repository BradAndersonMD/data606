do all the nine win teams are in there so like as in Evil Geniuses in we met we mentioned in the Cadillac gaming up here against golden Guardians in our fourth game of the day golden Guardians hoping to keep their playoff hopes alive with a victory here we'll see if they can do it as we had it back over to the casters for the callthank you very much. You're welcome back to the freak is bail is by my side at the park if not physically to follow up and close at that point Cloud 9 flyquest Evil Geniuses TSM and husband fees are all locked into the LPS 20/20 Springs flip flops there is one slot left up for grabs in a morals and golden Guardian are the four teams trying to pile of the clown from the only fit one shot they just need to win one of their two games and if they can do that then they will be in the playoffs the other scenarios require pretty crazy stuff going to Immortals going o2.pl beating C9 then you have a three-way tie at 8 that's really the only way that you like the LR golden Guardians could get in it would have to be this kind of crazyscenario so we'll see golden Guardians so obviously going to do their best to win out and try to finish on a high note the LG also looking for the same and I've got to stay until g-side a lot of these guys really looking forward to next find a prove that you deserve to keep spot on this roster that you are worthy of being on this damn it I think we'll be out there at 1 at Mid Blitz game he has really proved his worth I have been very impressed individually with his play and I think mother is Don CLG or some other team I'm pretty confident about their having LCS Squadronyeah definitely a strong player will see if course we know CLG can not get out of last place 9th is at 6 winds right now sealed you cannot get about five to matter what happens they are going to end at number ten but yes about rebuilding what is a title and a chance to go to MSI there's still the first timer 10 place in car wash it off in and get as good as you can to make that trip for the world's happen if you can make it and right now you going to see the golden Guardians they are hoping they must go to oh and if they can do it maybe there's a chance to make that last playoff spot for me and it seems like you just wanted to know why the most common pairing with ferrets over on that other side but it also leaves you with defensive Autumn Lane that I don't really see howwe are going to be having winning to be due on the bottom side regardless of who guards his is actually paired up with a couple games that I can recall we're both at LaFollette iberus folk style which is really strong for laying especially with confidence porch guaranteed hit on your e good help them get ready there they have locked into Jarvan alongside that a try to be strong outside Scooby-Doo and it's going to give oxygen to actually look for those really gangster me we just saw that we just totally just saw a check and get for a splendid level one it was almost a bit more reliable in a certain sense but would play out Golden Gardens of Fellini's magic damage requesting go to be to play a mage of course but in the case that they're going to get out ofyeah you be will get banned out I don't feel loved to see something like a Zyra Al oxide varistor to come to I do think that against Lanes like this pumpkins as well to have to leave early defensively TVs black tie rod and punish you incredibly hard I think you can throw things like alcohol is in Brandon that kind of boat as well that's if you're going to go Paris alongside a can become pretty impressive Duncan Sheik barely taking as pretty good read n&n shielding's our ability but at a certain point that leaves a piece of work is really and punish you have weigh in at least consider the possibility of it into your idea you know it makes sense they're starving get the play to support you saw in the LED lightthe Box late as well so you know who exactly knows but we also saw it as Bard toppling their support actually was a thing for a while quite a while ago with the E-maxx and kind of that AP Jarvan that would Staci playing like that but style don't think that's what we're going to get we are going to have corki mid here. There's a lot of scaling gear in the mid lane record of defensive wayfarer-style champion on those eggs but what I think that's really nice about this big is the ability to actually Rome up and down and kind of had these halfway room down the river where you can get a cyst fights with your ultimate frighten you have Jarvan for the cataclysm walk people in bro the mega Inferno bomb on top of that for The Sweet Spot guaranteed if you don't have flash or Dash to get out and that could be a pretty strong and gauge combohere is well that's going to be exciting so fun to watch these matches has diarrhea or braces before but they're going to give you the ziggs I'm a crazy watch this I have not really much of any music support one things going to working for it I guess is you know if you're looking at something like a Tom can't you can disengage the Tom kench fairly easily with things like that Satchel I will give you a little bit more survivability perhaps against of these gangs compared to something like is our who doesn't have any of that type of disengage this is also something where you can punish her it's so heavily ziggs passivewhat time does so much damage to turrets and you're able to refill that very quickly casting her spells after you actually use that auto obviously the Satchel to destroy turrets I don't think he's going to put in W till later on so that still will remain at 20% or so execute on that trip but you're expecting to have a winning Lane ziggs is someone who really can help you cash in on those to her place and potentially knocked down there Lee turret so very cool stuff from Golden Guardians I respected it's week 9 take a swing for the fences here and see if you can punish one of these Tom canceling Rising by the way I look well today so if you pick rate has not spice and you were recently yet maybe today's game will make that happen either way exciting I love new things a chance to like we've got a Veris ziggs bottom line and we'll see if it works out going to take a five-minute commercial break for competitive Integrity so she after thathello everyone welcome back to the show LPS is here and I love it if I left my weekend that's absolutely true are five minute delay for about done so the first break is over and are bald heads are here that's true yeah my head is more balls than yours because that's true of this morning around the beard this morning okay but not bad not about that I'm not I'm not there yet I mean like like like at some point should I just not doing it yet made it to do you do you freaked out I will and your ability to make these choices but still G vs golden Guardians we're onto the roof is fighting for their playoff lives here it is a very far outside chance of them making it in butany scenario we're going guys make them to win here against the LG absolute the case must 200 and even then they need a bit of help fix place right now since the 8th when they need 202 from Immortals have a chance at the postseason Guardians what can they show for us here today will they showed us the ziggs I like it I think it's a cool, it is not statistically very strong and so lucky that doesn't have to matter if you can make the Rome's happened is the latest post give a bully get some pressure get some plates knock it down with the herald. Down the satchel and they can start Snowball the Steeler gameI'm really surprised I've got to say that FBI isn't playing the pope style there are some pretty tanky frontliners over on CLG so I think that's why is going lethal Tempo and should be playing on it but he had played a number of games in a row of The lethality varus playing that book style and alongside the Diggs I was actually expecting to see double, do
