you have proved in the LPL this year they played their team owner only our team is absurd Buffalo sports are going to head right now and I have to tell another fun story before we get into the game and it is very much about the last time the Buffalo Zoo Buffalo actually what I want make me laugh was coming to the game the two teams has like a buffalo please don't take belt off of the games that they had at Worlds meliodas back in the starting lineupI had played the first four games the Mainstays Chevy Prizm 01 Ford not start they want it so he is back and ready to go at least overall was the main starter throughout almost the entirety of the BCS G2 of course we know from them new in the roster Mickey X to do with the roster first down to the bottom Lane and they have looked incredibly sharp three-in-one so far poised to go for him like that I think one of the areas that a lot of people are looking for for 6s or the Farms will Buffalo is that bottom Lane trying to get do Korra and palate off to a very good start to the day can try and take over well Turks and good in Lane there are opportunities for them to punishfor the side of G2 throwback to last year but no surprise that you would go for the Papas missing it made the same in yesterday that he believes Jesus proof are in fact that utilizing rice not just because of their ability to play the sepoy mutiny on the roster but so far along with a strong fault line in the temperature later on Rockside plenty of the front line damage off with an ultimate so as well what's that between both caps and Rise so they can outsideon the side of GQ where they can actually make early moves he's going to be very big for them standing up for that mid-game because that would be the area where funds will clear all ahead trying to get that early advantage and get those gold leaf rolling I can follow any heart valve control removed from the auction bear make sense to help keep whatever backliner alive or that's either the soul into playing rise or first on whatever Market he's going to play with her calm down a silly reason to pick something like a diet because she has a little bit of that sell steel to see what actually comes through here caixa off the tables or Calista off the table if we look back at what I did it would be a very to get rid of has come through I'm looking at a potential thresh maybe he has gone to things like thisthe pike as well as kind of Narrows and something a little bit more aggressive in This concerns me a little bit with the draft directions that going forward to Kaiser if something seems a lot I don't think that she's the strongest one be to Camp something like an Israel that could be our which means that it could be a situation with hot on a rolling his the entire gets annoying and I definitely could be difficult they could still do go with a range support like a Morgana that's a lot of pain and the black shield who's plays in Europe to bring it out and as a region someone has a high priority pick all the way up until even during the playoffs but it's definitely a farm Focus jungler but super good against low Health enemy Target collie caixa and recs I will all feel that cost is Ultimate later on in the gameis actually the choice here picked up I think the expectations from the side of g to oz at the Academy will be going through small plane but either way I think they can do well against something white and irelia I think that you have to be very cautious as that level six. The world around from the side of the road are my expectations are on the side of like the dive support that they have been able to draft here in the last two picks up a gentle on top of a Collie with Oriana or adding extra damage does provide a really good punch in a possible win condition here for the Buffalo that you have to really good primary Delivery Systems you meant to be a call either Rectify of course as well if you landed Frey sneaker you're flying right back where you hit and all the rest of them can all follow through so it aggressive team fight heavy backline killing companies near for funds with Buffalo G2 Esports one that does fit what he kind of needs. He doesn't kill one of the last letter is to look are there still arise and if it's your fault of those used to Lucien there's a lot of damage up here available on a well-rounded there of course I 131 T Morelli and Rhys both good at that as well so be looking for these teams have played their wind conditions played their play Styles and I've come to the fitting these teams has is wengie to typically play things like the coffis it's not until the making a 10 to 15-minute box where they really start to kick in together usually pay the early game of the first 10 minutes remind me to pay bills in early advantage to try and get ahead before the contest of Champions early on can exactly where the enemy jungler is and then you just walk in and get the rain flow with your wall but it's not from that you do have to play very Walk This Way is ready to go on if the last game of the first round robin you're in the middle of day three of the group stage here at MSY a G2 Esports a have been a pleasant surprise for lease I need to run through expectations here for the European Fanta there's three and one beating SKT in the opening game funds with Buffalo a team they are now expected to meet based on current form in a foreman run with it later on fight against IG is going to be telling people going to be watching for with the g2 Squad regardless they are here to give one of your best performances that a messiah see this team has pretty upset in the past we already talked about wolves last if they were able to get a movie to win against you to eat a lot of what we seem from them in this tournament is that they found early these they actually found kill advantages gold advantages but then they make that one crucial mistake and the end up floundering and everything starts to fall apart Wii sword against the flash. We saw a couple times it seemed liquids in the plain states and we just kind of want to see them convert those early advantages into an actual game with this little one not as spicy as the last 2 IGG games we had seen it it's going to be a bit slower here is caps and na will do a bit of battle here in the mid lane is a farm and this is one we did talk about it in the draft wet irelia against Ariana little weak in the early learning face Colby irelia Jennifer Sparks Mickey's not going to knock at their first Glen's got here you could have got the damage up for the kill a level 1 Class Auto for the plasma text is quicker free 2 minutes into the game we're talking about the bottom of the phone booth Buffalo they find it to be to kill Thicke ex did not get the dog back on his Justice by swell first was haunted for ecstatic did not claim them flashlight and he goes down does have displayed so you can see him moving aggressively Landing that unless you identify as a just a function not connecting to help by the field going to get this kale but it's still a forestry called double Summoners out of the G2 support that the only one up is that single cleanse for a person bottom length is massive ear for PVP really has been that stand out for them at this tournament will do what they can do because the lead from the bottom side if you can get your shine to level that is transferable then and it really does put a stop to a lot of those all in place. They have priority in both did and this is allowed meliodas to invade into the enemy jungle and steal away from to Buffalo solution take advantage of a wall he doesn't go for it Stop & Shop in the recall here they've got Yang Coast in the backside if they go for Yankovic's, he's going to get stop how far is it from all the way around to stop being critical of G2 Esports that was an overconfident play kooda just flashed out he could have just in case but instead chose another lands if you have the support room and look at this it's so tough forecast over the Oriana ball into the queue to try and get away meliodas actually taking power a Girl by hitting The Fray Secor and flashing forward no finish it off the kill do and then he Dodges the critical Q are also mangoes in that situation because he was even though he was planning to use on the meliodas is also hitting minions so the reduced Dental damage was not enough to find that kill and now the fault line continue trays going between the two dogs one comes up and then walking away make you not able to make that trade look too good do want to point out that person has gone equal in farm despite the death despite the summer disparity he is still farming just fine if the kill matters in that gold is relevant but delete otherwise keeping a bit equal looking to see what round two might be down here over all this game S40 in the Wild by goodness stuff on Buffalo are Standing Tall today continuing to throw out these place so aggressive in finding the rewards even making his way down towards the Middle Lane but the Buffalo they bringing meliodas for today's game in the primaries for the first two days but so far his early pressure with the right side and three of the four killed and I'll make you could take all at once again young girl with a 5-0 in 6 minutes which supports on the road pallet find the time to your once again getting Mickey and another killed over to the Buffalo was picked up by Rex size of a bounty on his head that is something that is fairly risky cuz rek'sai she is definitely a bursa Bowl champion but my goodness that is going to help with the snowball to get in early Warriors and a burst damage is insane and I want to see phone through Buffalo keep Snow bowling this bleed they are in such a perfect position for they've been in this position many times before I get as many clothes as you can build up what advantages you can't afford the cost at it's a level 6 boss and I'm going to look back at Mickey does it really react with enough cuz I think that you two were probably had their eyes and an offensive look they're looking for the place they wanted free on Midland and probably just walks up Elaine to talk and the follow-up there once again for PVP and I'll fight forward control and probably knocked that one down controller goes their way as we take a moment the one point of strength D2 is winning topside Wonder with the rise pic into a collie does have a huge Advantage up there on the top side or calling now approaching l o six point but I guess Big Carl take them down 03
