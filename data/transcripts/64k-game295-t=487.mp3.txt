play all powerhouses Megan is a view in North America it's going to be exciting Sunday definitely a huge Terry we didn't talk about on a piece all that much we talk about Good Deeds I think his play style going to let him go to buy stevia that goes to the bottle and helped out Bang Theory go topside helped out someday limited to explain that is most wins to lie with the most rainfall but not the most played by The Rolling what is good I want to see that comes out here for who he is definitely really good at getting the side lengths ahead and I want to see what the style is 400 Seasons yeah I think they are going to be here in specially for mid lane going up against Bjergsen has been very outspoken about how deep his people is right now and how he feels like it's really really beneficial that you can play a lot of different already know we're starting out very quick guitar pick for 100 thieves getting forgot off the bat that is incredibly important hiding with stolen you're going through so they don't have to show anything curly Plus is good it's just I on display licorice in the very last game if they want to they could just see fall outfits and shoes that match a GSM do they want for themselves a very quickly do you sound very clearly playing for team fighting thing Broken Blade let's not put you in a deep breath. Which I think I can make sense that's what I would do as well if I was dict over here we have tacos gray much more Champions Leagues there was already in and that can still play for Sunday keep in mind that loosen that is going to bang yeah I've actually seen quite a lot of the Top Lane Victor still floating around even after the nerves plus this can also be a bottom Lane Victor and Lucien transition to a solo Lane don't forget about that because you can easily switch out these matchups as far as your age doesn't necessarily have to go do bang and I like the kind of Versatility here in the current fed up with these three pics whereas couple years ago you like okay well that's a hundred percent pure mids it's no longer the case would have to be scanned surprises I just kind of enjoy that overall than idea probably a little bit here as well as second band face coming out as 240 locked in a support for themselves they can easily Bantu away and not cancel the afro boot options I would be worried on him giving anything like thresh I feel like that's a good one to totally win Bollywood but also Rome top and get some inventors especially if you're Landing if you're dating Foreigner. Or Victor I think pretty deadly is Champion so we'll see what he isn't actually afraid of yeah the promise we saw also pretty good against Ezreal can nullify that new ultimates everyone's been loving so much black lot of Hope damage the other possibility there longer but you tried calling out that was wrong is gone goodbye in their 40s Ms a good signal that they want to get more of that long-range damage as well but even if you do estim drazba 200 C's Vance your the try to drop some of your exhaustion May chocolate at the table at Saunders has to be a gun as well still have to go down that was a little bit and maybe we'll see if he waits until the end of the draft to make sure he knows he's higher coffees against going to grab some Neil actually the best deal to get it so late in the draft to be a great throw the rest of jungle out good with Katie and most likely we were kind of talking about Acadian style jungler freaks what I was talking about you really aggressive possible Flav now you can expect the math very quickly redba your level to start getting into some active especially Victor that's a champion early on he had to be so careful of a Camille jungle does end up with the worry about their early phases well Rush does come through for aphromoo Nandita jungler now in this one what would you want to pick said you want to get something want to play as default think the front line the primary gate is a bit weak for the lights pretty strong is still available and has a strong early game as well I kind of like that in order to combat it early aggressive team again the hard engages really only impression that can work with an unreliable but if. Dominant Lanes down here thresh loosen the bot side Victor Borge I are both can be really good topping up against I on here and Olaf is considered the King of this one DSM didn't either until the bitter ends billion just Dustin dehart engage in Lexington KY back interesting last pick your 40 at them bringing in the Delian for pure and let's see the switch is going off for 100 thieves where will all three of these end up in a blood Victor definitely abused Scion start farming to whatever you want to take you back in the day it was ice-born Gauntlet in Abyssal mask I'm actually seeing more raw agility park with a champion now is that was some of the balcony just left face images I erase erasers what will be that the squishy scalable that's Ian and two together and actually kill it. But if something is not too hard and he gets off at the thought into the mid game stuff up quite a few more points in the laser as well so you get a bunch of ways control with it when you do try and stack AP and go that route it's going to be exciting hundred beans and TSM way back when the world stopped at least drop in a group that had to face against the world champions of the world finalists so rough group for them but they have the very best and TSM those deadly Mist world's entirely they grabbed two to three new flavors for the main roster and going to try it again here in this one if you get them definitely do look start that you have the talent I think they need to make that kind of run but that's the goals for that mess with TSM expect out of that roster going to be going back supposed to be good as well and we'll see this all happened over the next nine months either way to Great rock is great teen books get ourselves into the game all right Spain's first LCS game as well as Broken Blade let's see how they fare I'm sure they are feeling a bit of the pressure getting into it a bit let's see if we have any sort of early action for everyone standing out so far will have the defensive opening but the kind of comment Scuttle crab Awards how do I expand the early action being team chants for example an Olaf especially something like that also could have follow-up possible so you see you like a threat I want that more I'm looking for more than just a standard fan out you know just look for the standard Wards and try and use that really possible power undertow from Olaf is what makes him so crazy trippy ass back up level one he's a fully capable Champion repeatedly Appliance Lowe's and trying to look for First Blood what it really good and sort of obvious things that I like about six the new TSM coach that I think is very good at level one whether it's because you're getting good advice nurse analyst or what but ones were always very very good and evil ticket that was well there for a week or level one banana should really give up it's a good little one for now also a fully operational what the weight on the sinus headache Baxter Lane a little bit late the lane is going to push towards him someday already got a couple of here Sunday as well with this Victor going to be able to Stone Scion back into the brush should be able to get up and early goals need for himself and that could be a dangerous thing for you have something to be able to scale up on Victor then it could make the late game device very serious about talking about 480 heavy are you really have to worry about the damage later on all right now I just seen the jungle pathing come through and just mining away the big truck has the highest armor and it's all physical damage for Olaf's speed a little bit right there really gold go to such as easily as late as though pretty well we'll see how much I can get off this wave got a couple more Minions that kind of belonging to him but someday we'll see what comes through eyes that he's got a stack of gold I can see right now from his kleptomancy someday able to get that one off of side + 242 it looks like it's got some pretty good are in G on his side start so far looks like we're talking with Dierks about something going on his side will wait to see what that one ends up actually being on the zillion following up in the footsteps of fellow Danish mid laner Jensen he was doing really well Matt Champion the previous year otherwise you're not a terribly event will start to this game I am still going to be waiting to see what the the focus is 400 things again I feel like both top and bottom Lane can be places that you attacking and the right now just going for the power clear will wait to see we have to go to ya both that supports packing a lot of crowd control so that could be an action spot Top Lane Tazewell Victor can be killed really really effectively with a Camille side if they have access to their ultimate that all ended a long Lane is going to be something that someday has to navigate but what kind of the opening of the game when it really go over the jungle opening was actually pretty interesting to me where they both started on the top side you didn't expect it to me over there but a little bit worried about possible you know Camille invades later on she jumps on you and Olaf gets Low House Clearing jungle Camp right it can lead to early kills you know so if your lanes aren't giving you enough support I can be popped up and it first quickly and it immediately transition to the bottom side of the map to make sure he gets his cruggs and power clear through his red do both junglers are on the same side of the idiots just got the Scuttle crab in the river and it's actually a reverse clear now for end up moving back up and do it suicide as we speaking meals clear on the bottom side Scuttle top of the Aaron back to the game with only three hundred gold separating the team about Lake Michigan so far from being an afro movie thresh going to stay away from any Q's overall plan to eventually think instead of parsley playing a piece of land surface Kamil Baker something that's supposed to coming through and there really aren't any good words right now in that River they can't be a Katie coming in too easily yep and I actually just farming at the moment none of that truly submittal all the wards reveal with a scrying orb beach pass by and grab but he's clearing everything already anyway. Very quick Dill to get right through it and you can go back for the base after this pick up some food for the predator action and really threaten suburbs around someday but I do expect this to turn into anything this kind of a convenient recall here protects against possible early attacks all this Victor which definitely do what happens at some point in this pushing you to be there for your properties a little bit there an ice tray. Broken but getting some damage and still down a little bit of Cs but against all right ready-to-use flash it looks like if you can get a wall jump the extended range with Camille using her flashed but can't be enough to follow this guy walks into laying here going to be a bunch of the minion wave so that broke out here very good recall timing for him allowing him to help you push that waves get the minions in their favor and it's about a thousand gold here on the science of can't look at a catalyst but whatever or I like the help she said just as well would you go check the dragons anytime your jugular show chop sideburns is an Olaf at this age do you have to be worried about the enemy jungler or solo a dragon easily do it as soon as a dragon spawn so you have to keep eyes on that big and again and we can keep repeating the season that's the first dragons are very very beneficial yeah you know they did get that big buff so in Your Vision on it early once it does spawn is incredibly important all right well lanes All reset and it's still the 600 gold bead 200C uses so far as going to go visit the blue team coming in after a showing at Worlds their first year in the ALCS and they put together I think a super-team I really think the pick up a bank was huge and I think I do have high hopes for this year was definitely it often a lot of people were talking about Team Liquid of course cuz they were back-to-back Champion upgrading but a hundred thieves definitely be best bar none who organization into the league with franchising plates the best they also made similar upgrade as you said adding bang that's two time world champion all starts to the bottom side if Lucien we should grass very good combo for playmaking they actually make something happen. All this area that mad because already Acadian on the Camille get then you get this message boards behind
