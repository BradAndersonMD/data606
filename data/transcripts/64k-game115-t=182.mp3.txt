he's performing really well not just being the lady and see if I carry but he's also played much more aggressive than many other 80 carries in the league and it's kind of new for him to be doing and what we talked about I think we do have to look over in the flyquest camp and call out the fact that solo is a back in today for the tiebreaker game as compared to buy for who was subbed in yesterday and didn't find success and they were hoping for solo who has largely impressed us so far with only three games played in the 2-1 record is back in the lineup Philly field after nothing but shift gear for flag bus to take to a hundred thieves it pushes the needle in the right direction I do think that's all has performed better than Viper Viper did not look good yesterday at also make a lot of sense Tito back in here but I think it's hard to call just off of that one thing you know I'm really interested actually see what we're going to get here in the draft because I do think it's like was get something that that is really kind of comfort for them as power of evilwhen is the only guy who can take over a game and who can really carry black glass over a hundred thieves ignore having Playmakers meeting up with santorin how are people being a little bit more proactive than we are used to seeing him over the course of his career he's playing his like the Rumble that was that they were pulling out through the same thing with the already but it's just a humble is so I would like to have some power early for poe2 going to make his own plate and then ignorant is born to claim or around that will look like in the first game of the day with that math being the lock in behind that for flight Questyeah I think Cody's main Champions are all kind of band out now if I'm pretty curious with pollen going to go if they're going to end up doing the Admiral the kite there maybe they'll do the various pumpkins which is a pretty popular Lane recently Pumpkins band I'll call them right now Berenstain Bears still an option there still an option First Care Center that will be the pick up four hundred thieves so actually looking at the mid laner and a jongleur in fact would you would you expect then maybe a continued 80 Kerry pangere in the second phase of bands from Blacklist probably this looks like a pretty easy band 480 Harry's because right now you have the last pick you're going to be able to afford pick your jungle for a flyquest so they can actually just leave the rest of the supports up because all of them have counters now and use the your last big rig North to get the support counter but this is his go is leave their Midland Phil 4:5 and banal to Sandra and pick the Ori and try to bait power of evil into the re again cuz I think because a lot of these bands work on it doubts benefit only been actually 5 Marksman played by Cody done throughout this entire split only one that isn't taken away right now is the diet but they've been there caught so you know not available you can obviously still play xayah alongside other the forest but didn't mean to the see if it's a signifying a hundred fuse has something a little bit special prepared if they have something you know kind of like a Secret pink prepared because they are the ones Banning out a lot of the stuff that they were most commonly go to I was even saying I have a caisson and they've been well-liked yes I think I want to do a brown Blind Pig so I'm assuming you were getting jungle pick up like you called they'll probably in that fourth slot for flyquest now the response 454 thieves would they will have to pick up both there any Carey and support here so our questions will be answered soon around What's the Pic will be Kaiser two big ones that were called out the Brom Brom set brownies from Brownie and it wouldn't be brought me that's an old glass yet I mean we her Folly you just saying earlier about how Cody someone be able to play practice and have to doing that and that's going to split 10 signs before a typical for him he is truly no more like the guy who withstands Elaine your scaled up in the Takeover defy this is where they are going to look to really I think play in the faith of black West but I do have a choice of support counter they're going to go with the humidity so it's something I do think that MF could be somewhat vulnerable against something like they're the Brom Lucian and obviously there is the potential problems there but not exhaust to keep going bad that I think they probably complain more for making and cheese bites a little weird fairly early game cough with Lucien Brom and and not be more prioritize around killing bottling but maybe maybe they just want that to leave it sufficient so you can just leave Lucian from on its own you actually play more about outside maybe does well against things like the atrox in the pantheon it's one of the Champions that isn't just guaranteed dead if they actually jump in on you because you are fairly mobile and if you do have a problem with with Guardian with the shield being thrown up with exhaust there's the ability to actually just peel back and and kill off these frontliners as they are diving in because aatrox and Pantheon are not Champions that you need to have like seven stained front lines reading marksman to deal with right Lucien can kill those absolutely so now that we've seen the compositions locked in before we head to our competitive Integrity break I just want to get a sense from you guys we had a discussion about momentum and some of the success of the of the stars on hundred thieves and Ty break situations the substitution for fly Quest coming in but now that we've seen the compositions laid out for you to be squads where does our confidence life or who is going to be moving on to face Evil Geniuses for that second place slots steals my point is they have 28 Roxanne and Pantheon jumping in but I do think the fact that they don't have any easy Frontline to battle the brownie composition I think it's going to be very easy for a hundred days just to pick a Target and kill whatever they hit it first I was already with under these before the draft I think the draft is is fairly easily to ask you how you can just hit anything click it's not like you have to play the fights in a complicated way he'll back they've got lots of seeds be absorbed engage in and kill off a truck scale Pantheon well if these are looking to steal this one away from flyquest move themselves onto face Evil Geniuses to lock up that second slot in the playoff picture either way both of these squads are in the postseason guaranteed top for the teams will be in the rift in just about 5 minutes we do have to head to a break for competitive Integrity issues as usual so I'm sure freak and Kobe will see you guys on the other side of that 5 minutes hello everyone and welcome back to the lcf get the game started up very soon as they battle for a top spot in the playoffs second third and fourth place all tied in the regular season this battle is a fight for will if you lose you get 4th and if you win you fight Evil Geniuses for a chance at the second speed we're going to see this going on pretty soon do the quick pause ignoras restarting a computer this is the battle for the battle and it's a little bit but it means that cloud 9 cannot choose you early on and everybody wants to avoid Cloud 9 as long as possible until you know you eventually will have to play them people are assuming in the finals I definitely think that I did leave so I can announce his talking about have a good chance that that because they have been a team that has been surging towards the end of the split rather than a lot of the Winds coming from the beginning right that's great I know we saw some sweet few days ago about VLC of stock market and people like buying in a pair of all the analysts but negative start at $5,000.42 or under apparently due to a clerical error will save the Maya and none of these the very beginning and then hopped off the train at least I thought I did apparently I didn't know the record Good Enough by sitting with them so analysts that mean that you've been making changes and they've just been ignored because the entire split we have to keep every two weeks making changes to the purchases and I was like okay I'm all in on CLG now cuz like they would like I would get posted posts like my my like portfolio value and I'm like okay fealty then and then like 2 weeks choose a path that you're there for the other guy right I'm going to stick with the LG okay
