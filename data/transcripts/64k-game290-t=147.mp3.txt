and both these teams at you looking pretty sharp. We'll see what it looks like I didn't go to Bud Candy playoff teams that may be poised to do so right here Camille Cathey is so far off the table and I got to ask you some more rock artists from Rush he didn't seem happy so I told me 02 in a week in the ALCS so we're going to win today because Rush will never go 0-2 in the week is that true after this weekend yeah and now that has been brought upon broadcast it's one of those things where you couldn't talk about it you're the magic to stay alivewell I am interested again as you pointed out of optic disc like red tide eye when you think back to summer as they were certainly a team who was doing a lot of cool stuff with Connor fix they were doing some stuff they did your kid if you are they've been a lot of different things in that regard so I'm going to be excited to see if they have anything up their sleeve deer with the red size collection all right now is pretty standard stuff for. Nashville surprised with basically no one in this draft but keep my dope of a certainly a Big Top Lane counter Pick 4 phone is back in the last season he was one of the big short players he had lots of traffic to a lot of the meta top laners look what we wanted reflect picchetti metagame now we're going to be locked in your life around and drink a little bit weaker but we will see as the Lord is not hard for Xbox and is locked in that being said can still be our got mad and you could have your top or not to take for a lot or vice versa see if he can fix for Crown straight for these days and pick ban it's basically band Lucien and then you know pick as real of that stuff and then if you look back taking you pick I then it seems to be those are the only Champions really getting play in the bot Lane these days with LL he's a lot of gameplay. So certainly not surprised to see that foreign support a feels like a bit of a flavor pick we start to games from JJ last week we got Seahawk will bring it out yesterday as well but was that shut down pretty have Levi's think I'm parked by the Nocturne pick on the opposing team very hard for Jaco to redirect in all season and catch a lot of players with the when I was billion in the mix right here of course it's still can go support though I feel like it's more commonly a mid laner but going to be able to go watch we'll see what it comes with that said I do think you could kind of Isaac I always look at it as agreed for it and I didn't warn you can kind of play a bit of a scaling support what is not the one who should be pressuring you accept Lee Hardin Lane is not the right if you want to get some extra value out of that bottom land I think that's something that you can look to get away with it similarly is lck people bring your galio pics and if people are going to play these passive no lames you can start some kind of try to one of them and I'll steal them even in this world so what's up with them spells banding York and even the doctrine that I feel like I haven't seen College delayed as well cuz you can dive in and just be revised to be that he'd take methyl and isn't choices here we'll wait to see what David wants to fly keep in mind that Joseph had a hurry just might just pick it again but that's not an option here early Band by a fox in that first phase no bra no Kindred know not to New York was mentioned on the band certainly is expecting that off thick is already selected there till later jongleur target support would be the obvious rolls to still remain and Articuno least in is available rushed you know could grab it up himself if he doesn't want to go for it and we do have Comcast 4th so we do now know that one is almost certainly it is going to be Miss Deli in an end top laner got in top loader I see Ezreal jungle can't stop but I feel like I'm like to hear it open or nand a lasagna for set up really all about Anna farming with double Karthik big this week Echo Fox used to be focusing more on the early aggression the ganking power from their jungler go and listen yesterday kha'zix today Ranch going to be grabbed up remember that is being picked into the tomten so you know that can be a fairly difficult matchup but we have seen great directly or so I just talked with navigate this well and you try to hook onto the Ezreal and then take that in as he gets devoured you double play if you could do something different that is a disgrace I don't care who wins I'm glad it's not supposed to rain guard in the jungle before. It was a jongleur he was a top laner Wrangler made it look there anybody have you talked about this billion-plus Nocturne. Exceptionally well with billion-plus Rengar throw one bomb on to ring guards head speed him up he jumps in that explodes adding Stephen Morris Fascination power they're not to mention to revive the certainly a very strong Duo there and see how well they are going to therapy because you do expect 363 kind of waited a bit more toward the Cossacks and lysandra and this is a Top Lane orange slices we didn't even get there early mentioned because we got to got distracted by the rain guard here so not a lot when you see these days ever since the W Shield was removed his praise are so much worse and he is a sinner. So I think it is a very tough matchup that track how wealthy is going to be able to survive up there if they're left on an island so I'm going to be something to walk 4 hearing exciting stuff this could be a very so far is this season I like him so far as a player he's had a short career in the ALCS but I think he's been pretty solid and we're getting into the LCS stage on the rift game 2 of the day Echo Fox and Austin was even get some revenge for being taken off the roster Optical with a largely Academy Focus team 3 in 1 start far above almost everyone's expectations and it's interesting conversations with people expecting Arrow to have his Visa coming for next week you know if I've heard people talking about that then do you actually swap in the rest of the intended LCS starters with that if he cares or 3 and 1/2 the even get stuff doubt you subbing meteos with arrow do something no one is I keep it Rollin in a few the hotter and it's interesting question because even if on paper or some of the other players are better if there's if everything is just kind of clicking right now with the current optic roster yeah it's hard to know if they'll make those flops I'm slowly but of course really teasing is the time to figure things out CLG done a bit of that when they got their first win yesterday we'll see more of them today as well 7 to watch for ASRock SLI pushed around and the Damage going through 4. I can do no for Rush also time bomb I'll be fine but he's going to be quite a bit lower for this clear yeah we'll be a fairly low but thankfully you know kha'zix it does have a pretty good to clear and he's actually going to start rapping so maybe just doing a double you start here very likely to be starting on that Rafters in Hilo doing this probably but do you can go Raptors read the Scuttle something like that but. I certainly going to be having a better time with his start as he is getting a Leash tab didn't get poked out yeah it's not too bad so far though rough with health and puff W start is reasoning a lot of hair after cancer so does seem like that was already the call with the child to start in the first place and it's both posts down though on the first camps yeah that's definitely hurts if he does run into dock but should have a pretty good time with things as though she wants to get to the Red Bluff over and everything is still be totally fine yeah alright well getting food stamps right here with a fridge in a power clear on the docket looking at ah play no surprise circles in the early Push Pull I keep checking in later on throughout time is as they'll mention there's not a lot of toppling or in any more in Pro play the rating is a lot weaker but we'll check in throughout time midlane actually sofa what about Brown actually because we heard from countdown to getting the day there's a good chance that Crown if he's single most important pick up of any team in the offseason and he has a very good his actual c s b St at 10 is highest of all mid laners Nelson and who is undefeated and also liquid the best team in the league but I think a lot of places that are doing well yeah they definitely are infinite sum of its me that much more effective when you're not surrounded by this all star in a 30-40 pass right out no 4th PL it's a whole Squad of All Stars basically in an optic and not have high expectations do to succeed anyway I think he is extremely impressive and it's it's been a pleasant surprise because Crown a lot of people do think that suit you probably will Champion the last year in the lck crown was certainly struggling at World they had an early exit as well so we didn't even get to play for a lot of the regular season nearly make that and they happen either way he will at least pick the crop out and it's Rush us to get away from this window clip with already delayed Bush Insurance discount goes over the optic sight that's a nice little invade even though he does not get the blue he still has nightmares no chance of Russia was going to be able to pass that with solo plugged in and do foot roaming over other crap to see another really talented player performing well in the ALCS always good to see his first start with Renegades all those years ago and dresses that one of his trademark Champions and those two have done some pretty good things throughout LCS before but they've been some of the major right now coming into Midway surprise explodes with some people are hoping for the consistency of Apollo been pretty high and have been one of the positive force wreck about getting win a really good word to describe them they have been very consistent for a very long time they are not usually considered the best of the bottomlands Malik they're always going to somewhere more on the middle but I do think that they are consistent performers they can have high highs that I certainly will you think back to Spring split last year HAPO a famously defeat the first team to get a knockout to get them before the finals with clutch there in an aqua having an incredible performance on thrush dumbass Champion against one of those for and so far the bottom it looks pretty decent this is like I said he was winning Lane and not feel pretty positive sounds good for something more passing the match of any way you expect some of this to happen anyway but I can just as good in Russian missile of mountain break as nice as well left over that sound cool. If you were found to have to flash but looks like the early Mountain Drake will be a formality here is like a fox or going to dedicate the time to Snow Camp anyway and this rake is worth gold Annex be more than it was in the previous season and so slowly slowly slowly not Drake is the tankiest of all the Drake and slowly but surely it will drop Michael help take it up and they will get through the mountains right here in this game not bad at all it is one that I have to get anything from it early on but kha'zix is already an incredible bear and take her as his caixa so if you're looking forward into the game if they're in a good position that can help to enable that much more and appear on the top side dhokla is level 6 solo is not so they may be essentially looking at depression with the very least but not going to try for any crazy times bar is around but he's 5 with 0 XP to spare so close to the level up anytime soon so I was back up and going to be a while so that comes out and happen and wait to see what comes through is it simply a only 7cs sleep right here for dummies nausea denying that much room still owe those holding up pretty well nothing to to crazy but I do think it can't get tougher for the tanks as I get some more levels and passive cooldown shortens up and then she wants her you don't want something like Black Cleaver that can get really really difficult to deal with all the city are the levels that he picked up by that point but we'll see I'm still looking make it through at the Landing phase I do think this is still an incredibly strong a pic for the team fights right you know the ultimate is incredibly powerful that really is the bread and butter of the or the engagement and she is extremely high so we'll see how well he's going to be able to perform I know later to do the plank over the old way the cast of cursed as soon as you talk about him doing okay he does get solo killed up there do classes Spellbook ignite plus the ultimate in the fade enough to knock him down I think these are sold at least you guys have two tee pee so should be able to collect that most of those minions for the experience and gold but definitely going to feel good for a joke to be able to get that sorted springboard into words that Black Cleaver there is one more time that he has a Spellbook ignite ready he is Bubble 6 able to just really connect with everything he flashed there for the not really any time for so it's a reactant that is just really well done from dhokla I'm assuming she peed into the river because it seemed like solar was fairly far up and he kind of got around on him a little bit and fellow just a not maybe noticing until we're coming in or for under estimating I just how much damage you can do with that ignite available the rest of it in that was really nicely done to your good son coming through Crown going to get rid of a lead here in this HP do you want to see Lenny face and we're seeing Crown behind and farm that is a big fat
