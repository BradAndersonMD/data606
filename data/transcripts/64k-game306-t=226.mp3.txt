personally hottest man single-handedly almost maybe they're watching a lot more LPL I just love watching him play carries he did show up once earlier than turn it but it was on a Scion so I'm praying for carries in toppling for try the interesting thing is ELP I'll ever since you know people LifeWay shout Uzi in the lake I just ain't sent it around team fighting bottom line tearing people apart so you don't really get Carrie soft playlist with someone that tried to do what you know LeBlanc Top Lane qualifying into the LPL now and state gaming close by that also has U-verse able to pick up kind of Assassins may just be carry top laners and have great impact in the game so I want to see whether that is something that they try and add right now in the plane stage to make people aware in a best-of-five I mean I also like the timing of it when you are on the right side this is a team and a region where everyone's talking about throughout the year blue side being so overpowered really having pick advantage in the LPL red side actually had a higher win rate at the same timethis was in my opinion largely because guys like to die and a lot of detail guilty and were able to use counter picking so effectively red side and slamily of course they already played this game and this is a very exciting game overall do what they will indeed choose to play of course 3 carries already gone with the akali aurelion Camille bands from earlier on theater at Ace rock smash up down there as well I'd be sad if it was on Versailles on but of course that could just happened I would be sad and you know we have to keep mine hunter these are already out of the tournament but they can still do other Western Brothers fanatic a favor here you know if you do actually in a beat Invictus Invictus lose again I believe that would actually matter they're so obviously you know it would require two losses for Invictus though most like later on we know they're both coming outbut yes it's Matic one game behind you saying as hell they can take that first seed in hundred thieves can only help fanatic but even if you want to play it on the line help Cloud9 give them an easier for us credit for it if I like upsetting a dick is even easier to move on from this point as we has been grabbed in sokai set alarm for the bottling vs. IR work on if I could see that you know you going to get Foster probably a hundred days he has been able to secure a table pay citations Homestead makes sense which has it has been up and down I think there's a main issue a lot of people would have with it a hundred days right now is their execution throughout the earliest stage of the game they pulled out in 1 V1 to V2 situation means Anna has to get incredibly busy around the mouth when you don't necessarily doesn't want to be in that kind of situation to pay top make the proactive Choice a lot of the time unreactive back foot and I think that that is wet a hundred things need to stop putting the Methodist I definitely agree and it's tough as a jungler enter midliner is losing these mashup heavily to really have much priority in the jungle because guys likeguys like half door then going to join up with their junglers they're going to invade they're going to be in your face and no last time around 300 these did struggle pretty heavily against Invictus gaming we'll see if they can turn in more impressive performance here are they are also obviously playing for pride they want to be able to show that they can compete with some of these talk to you after they want to get back to the drop quickly this is something that I actually do more people to expect he became a little bit of a man because he was just willing to Blind Pig thing and the drop he does have a great town to pick flexibility however with the guy coming in they do like to drop the priority of his big down to the bottom because I guarantee that line where you was not known for his cookie playing found in this situation and I do think this is now a drop where you can play the world stops I thought of mine going to stay out just fine so funny when they grabbed up here and yes it's can be flexible between top and Middle East in both lysandra & Spine in both these roles but I'm still expecting that to be just another love song I Met game for Wii U and a blind sign up for Sunday yeah I mean we haven't really seen you flying a lot of tanks made so I'm really intoare going to get that carry top and it'll it'll probably our GP is one of the most popular picks in the LPL certainly is an outstanding performer from the red tide end of the tanks often get that somewhat free Lane scale up and then have a big impact later on though it's unlikely if it is also a very good Gangplank this year as well I'm not expecting it just saying it is an option here at the time ticks down this is very very like Wood Lane assignments are Leona is known as what supposed to be a good pic into xayah rakan but of course I ever conflagrated do in themselves bottling to get to swing into ride to some Gangsta not going to drag us both make it happen but the one I'm excited for is this try getting a free Farm Lane and potentially taking off and this is a thing as you know we might actually allowed games like in a lot of the games that I was able to say to get a kind of on her Astro at that lady's face Denny's ultimate in fight it's just such a useful tools having an a 08 Toyota Corolla people into specificis at the map especially when you fighting round face black repair old bike early Dragon just become such a part until obviously like him Stanley potential is a gang playing also off the charts knocking for Ser if you're fat or galio or your TV that does nothing when the lights go out when paranoid but you can still have a team-mate paying or you just like pressed for and see where they are and just dropped a button down on them so either way a game that will be fun to watch the victims of the only undefeated team left at world only three themes in the end up 4014 have gone undefeated in the group stage two of them went on to win the championship Samsung white and if they feel like I'm see one with maurin for those do squats and the only other loss to the one who went on to be the champion South High Kings on certainly if you go 6 to know things are looking good for you I G has had impressive group stayed so farand it really has seen bikes probably is only fanatic who can challenge them but we'll see if under these can Buck the trend in and upset this group a little bit quickly the start of this game because there's two things I do IG was underrated coming into the store to minute that contest vs R&G we're closer than people had given them you know credit fall on paper or a cat named and I'm not saying it. Or I'm just sitting here and as highly rated isn't as good as people right at them and now I am positive believer in phonetics I think Will Proctor in Castle shown in the TV to Midland will give a lot of times trouble in best-of-five series they have a lot of weapons to be able to throw at you so that means it Invictus gaming potentially is a top-four team in the world right now and what does need to you know really be given that respect they definitely do I need to do this day really has been very much it seems like about fanatic an IG going stroke 4 stroke going545 kind of thing showing who can be more dominant because it has very much turned into it to teen group and that's going to be a force that six game Showdown it if I can find a fuse pull the upset win here it means that there was no tiebreaker needed fanatic and just win take care of business and then be the number one spot and suddenly have a much easier chance as we know all the other teams that could be in the quarterfinals in you and you see if I can come out all the number one teams were the expected number one teams seconds to get out of this group is much harder than it would be if you're freaking out of the group absolutely and I think that they think the Mets is it we have some wild cards coming out now ATT no one really knows how long we going to say the fat to me GT for the Westin ATT losing landing page Cloud 9 how did not attend a performance in that group stages I think the fanatic has to be more consistent than both of those teams in IG now need to show the same consistency as a golf against a hundred faced a very consistent C they only dropped one match the entirety of the LPL summer split yes they did lose eventually in game 5 to Royal never give up in the very finalsbut I still speak to me like a consistent team that can do a lot of good showing I had IG the top 14 coming in the world that has not changed her me and I want to see if they can keep taking care of business and make that 600 run kinetic to be honest because I bought a zoo interchange top light is but if that's how planets play different roles on the table yet they find success with both of them they both have support players that domestically people they should be questioned they make questionable decision at certain time I mean it looks like I'm bow out of the moment you know certainly two of those play that you have to take a look at those so many cops in about 2 hours to check the game of the day and maybe the 7th if we have a tiebreaker but for now it is under these hoping to do whatever what team liquid did on their exit of Worlds which is they might be out they might be down but getting us feel good wins for the regional pride and of itself is very valuable here and I like that. So they stand this. Everyone in line and they going to look to get the early push they going to start Andrew phuckable on the fivewhat's my balance done rhetoric aside from attacking anymore and not trade goes level one is one of those Matthew is something that kind of tends to lend itself towards a more up-tempo game which I think is the style of a play you're going to need to bring out against IG I don't believe that hundred thieves can play a slow Mac without game against this team and come out on top so desire work on bringing out the Nocturne blue Sondra so much. So much engage for them to be able to Target someone like that you love if you could get that perfect and take him down you will have a chance to win the game but I mean Jackie love taking the cleanse is also a very intelligent moving and not two words that same as play that way naturally and this isn't your natural tendency which it is a 400-page you know they are more of a scale up into the lake GMC send you are at risk of trying to do something against the team that just does it better than youYouTube games does Norco welding landing page if she's able to field any of that lady Jackie left his keys in his early to this game feels very difficult for them to come back through all agreed to have the practice going to come in through from scrims maybe they got some good games in a bill has not shown that style a lot throughout the year they're much normally a consistent teen budding light came through the same as I can find something supposed to be I think and as I can get a pretty good for himself will see if they can make that difference and find those sides in the back line makes his first appearance as well here on the Predator drag it says other is a lot of just going to frost a board here in the mid lane in the bottling with the Leona and the Rye there's a lot of set up for this gragasin it is certainly something where they could I make an early aggressive way and rookie already starting dominance here in the mid lane again for you and he's also going biscuits so he is going to be able to have the additional sustained and perhaps a secure himself an early dinnerhe is also paid the cleanse tag that means he's not going to be able to steep tea back into Lansing maybe an early it. Feeling that be able to just sit there and wait for the probably say that is a fair that I am coming into I like the choice from Rookie I do think that right now nothing has the world is usually stop bottom line is off CC gas mid-length off you know 1850s at this stage of the game he's just a test a very good job of shadowing the bottom side of the map and just making sure that these Lanes don't come on the pressure cuz I'm most probably gauge is going to put into the Gangplank and this will just be a bomb test here comes to the Barclay no part of you on your lot of damage to his dominancepromise later this early on to be able to take down tree you already looking a bit Grim Heroes IG also setting up for a dive on the no flash afromoji so likely to happen here we go 3 vs 2 The Flash goes down south. I don't even go into the flash list I guess they just make sure they take down the Haley tareyton I even more so as to why this is a great start to the game by Victor gaming really is it just great execution from them forcing out the summoner's committing on that. They already had a huge advantage in the bottom Lane and you're the solo kill one more time you had already been choked out pretty low and reused has account to pick in this matchup this is rookie wide picking rice someone that is good with Jakob distance that without it and just do not really know if you wanted to level 5 and still able to pick up at 2coffee flour at all to not only does real good solar field he loses his flash I certainly is potential to attack that lane once more I from the side of name who also didn't even have to finish flash on the bottom side and has a predator Boots available as well actually pushed the shrine that was an ultimate can't trade back just yet but niggars I can run for a second tank of a game and then at the end of waiting around to see each other someday and then has flash be needs bit Predator still on Wheel he pulled the trigger so but I don't know there's about what does not have a damaged to kill as it gets filled Away by Sunday over a hundred thieves come out on top there and what is the two flashes of Predator blowing the Gangplank ultimate so no credit 200d Zonda is in the right place at the right time to this timestop this and get more over as long as so that's a great collapse coming through from a hundred things you could say the it actually looking for a rotation play do you want me to lot of damage but where you will go down bring the cleanse and re-engage is almost enough to kill as befitting a bit louder now and a walkthrough for the fierce bilitool turn off though and watch out for the damaged my Tri-Rail want to separate and is going to be on top of them they're so damn it do you know for real I'm making it look easy the one be to chasing them down 3 was starting to fight at Full House with rookies out of vision in that bush jumps out about two-thirds of his health right off the bat expensive cleanse I just know these guys do not have a lot of resources here you see without weights out the spell shield
