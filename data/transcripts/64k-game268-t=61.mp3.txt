them worked out extremely well and they were able to get some of the primary Champions that we've come to know for the flares atrox was such a tremendous bar in playing the weak side of the map for them and playing it very effectively also dominating a lot in teen twice before it's not quite yetall right so the governor of death going to be at the table here at the fox what it once again go for the early 80s rock snow and said Jarvan is up as the king of the jungle and that's been taken away so will you look at the roof first pic like we had talked about but is going to rush back on his driving his most played by a Lockton now Acadia play to the new in this series right the Gators game playing a game number one was take away the job and he keeps on playing it he must be reliant on it but me by having the Kindred in that match of it having the exchange of sides of the map Echo Park. Construction fig leaves with all that dragon in bottom side control definitely worked out in their favor the last time this was TSM picking the Galileo in the Jarvan will it still be support jungle Oblivion something different now we know driving is flexible but almost by the time he is a jongleur has gone top before knowing new looksplay to play hard and we had that with Robin Kelly on some of the things that people I talk about with your accent is how flexible of a player this guy is he played so many different Champions and critically so many different styles last game is on this billion you know it's a more defensive later 14 fighting very timing intensive lissandra he also plays very well looking for loans early on trying to push the wave quickly doing hard and gauges for the team he's had a lot just the split even timing very well with Acadian for both of them going in at the same time finding critical target comes through in this still looks to me like the makings of TSM be able to go topside a lot to be the same as round Jackson is Dillion but we've seen listen to run the top layer acts like it as well but once again go topsidefind broken plate a good match for any other powerful top laners and they can still go to the same kind of game plan with a clear and I do really like recti for topside domination Rex I can go over the back of that large wall behind the top laner come from behind your own trick even also can dive with the ultimate with your level 6 you can drop our a grow more options with hard for seeing if you are telling your enemies that you're going to Camp topside at least you have more options to hard forced it and I solo options for out playing there if they decide to once again to exchange size of the Mask as well kind of learning in the previous game the Kindred from Rush the virus in Apollo and the eight boxes solo is he still do not see the Xbox stop playing pictures yet to get one final bandsaving account to pay for Broken Blade super well with the damage output and can handle that lane quite effectively Xbox One to bring out for the wrong Top Lane tier that's interesting though we haven't seen her picture yet she is dropped off the tables like a fox a cat has played her a fair bit bladimir has been a good pick for so that was that was left on the table on the top side that says they have Corky and deadlines already going to have to rain damage dealers on your team with do see that they're bringing to the fight so it's pigeonholes solo into playing something on the top that a map that will bring some sort of structure do the dean's bite force of this game is going to be topside focused road going to come through basically invisible to Vladimir that silence Theory good againstdo you want us to kill but it does Bill your role of your tank email a champion that brings DC to the team's though also fulfilled the team wide aspect there definitely can't get over ex Eye Blind Manziel has yeah juggle Tower at a very effectively all right back line power or Apollo here and talk about the rain daily damage these are two of the best in roll and this is part of a box that for now it's 5 game winning streak at the end of the Spring Fling he was Vince games on a follow-up he popped off in the end games Phoenix a very good Corky as well we're seeing cleanse have it on both went to survive the back by an accident but the attempt to go topside or Flop I was talking about in game number one Champion Select been going to one of his other most played Champions the callista she's dominated with origin and which combination with galio the CDC is insane be able to save galio galio is going for initiation throughout the team fights or female to put Galileo in even in the tube on bottom side do you have to be to come it kills coming through the galio usually taking the ignite are completely changes the bottom my last time the bottom Lane we're both teams were farming out an echo box that is very good flushed taking the early turn around there's a lot more fight this one it's another game though it looks like 3 teleport still one where that bull run map Mobility could be a big deal for TSM all their major grade rats have it Acadia now on the wrecked side should be a very good early jungler to go to shake hands sixes first split with Tia Sammy's made playoffs. 3rd speed open to do good work here and Tackle Box Bell and those three core members of annuity did last year and take down PSN the quarterfinals nopales and they remember I'm quite sure that they do and they've got something to say about it here wake me up DFW the players already pretty good but will see into this series we go 1-0 Echo Fox and see if you didn't answer back before 2 we are on our way up for game 2 and I think that's a really a flying even just in this game because echo-fox do have a lot of power that they can bring towards the late game if drinks and Corky can get multipliers going that is a tremendous damage output with cho'gath one of the highest health scaling champions in the game on the front side and Rush the option to go either Warrior or full tank cinderhulk Darvin I think with this setup I would opt for the center hole full tank because you have again plenty of damage for team fights later on yeah and I also see that you have a couple of tanks already and don't need to be hard Freightliner but I agree that just simply taken for quirky things could have been seen by so let's see what it comes down to Ben's how the game goes by conkarah Jarvan I feel like it's not the most common maybe I'm out of touch a Different Drum goes I still don't think as taking over the most common room usage but it does also to me signal another option for building full tank because you have longer to get off and Prok your conqueror product thinking Rush may be going that way however if you want to get that where you want to get some really kills on Direct I told her that way if it's the way that you will and will have forgotten Warrior is better Duolingo the cooldown reduction is also really under-estimated part of the early Warrior Powers by which an option but I think especially with the Conqueror and might want to go for a little bit more longevity and I both been dropping 1 cm in the first wave of the Kaden to take down these chickens that much of an issue could have gone for a lucky few over the wall but they have been a blind Gaston doesn't happen there is a trace of your son X-Men a little too and we'll see if any more pressure happened last game Phoenix I was actually win they know Jarvis is a very common level two baking champion and the big different this time around there playing the callista galio much more aggressive Lanes they want to be able to push up so they do but the word down here they're still around to see Rush Enterprise rushes in the full version of everything right now we know Rex I did read to Rafters but Rush going to go to the blue buff Steven that should be pretty safe moving around to get some could have come around if they wanted to with their bottom Lane but with the kitties polygon that word trading sides of the map like this can be very detrimental if your soulmate's are both losing and getting pushed in because you can't get collapse fun soccer BK Ciara's both junglers are going to be on her act for the moment and it should be what people referred to as vertical jungling way just do the enemy Blues. Right after your red instead of going to your own and of course you going to the school later pretty good down here against our side close to Galliano play safe against the Jinx you could be around is unspotted could turn on any kind of gang who's out there we go is summer camps were taken away by the wrecks I as akkadian has I don't believe taking the full can't get I'm not certain that's very similar chemically being done by both these teams responding of jungle camps they do come back with more experience do you want to delay it as long as possible small wolf not worth too much of course Richmond take his fullkrug Camp as an RX by and I can't even have a chance to do the same here and guess she get all of the golden X beat that will be a small military leave for the next five Alexis Rush Camp Sargon doesn't cover the top link into the flag of a wallpaper store your board to watch that in the brush so no pressure top by the movie The Farm off small lead to bladimir but not gigantic an erection with the last vestiges manifold Claus away can you be back to Lane he's going to be able to refill pretty easily after that there wasn't really much of an investment for rush for going for that even though I didn't have a huge chance of burning a Summoner he's passing back down to the bottom of that anyway because he is Raptors and frogs are available if so you don't really give much away considering there's not many other spots that you can be so it's not even a big information change and is Phoenix box back to Lane 14 and 1/2 tbsp to take the long way back in Russia's to get back just to get the XP and gold and timetable starting I just picked up so you can have money to spend on their is the invade comes in as far as Wing spots rush I believe you can stop there a couple of? Things going down for a possible movement as they're able to deduce that only corner of the map that he being right now little room there from Dierks it's trying to help control this Vision around the bottom side as well since just want to have aggression with CD coolest The Galley arrested actually going to go in and get spotted by the controller can't finish it off he goes Which Way by occasional for little five if you wait too long a flag and drag you can on react to get the Nock point right now closer and enter the game lost now is like a fox and a do some different back in the midst by a lot playbuzz.com for Phoenix with those items feel pretty good about that fight yeah and Phoenix also has an extra charge and is corrupting potion to Shug right now they see Rush completely not only did they have the Deep War but aliens around here on rek'sai with pack of things going down hey so much closer than this time TSN the lead you going to follow her over the wall look for Rush. It was a close one and even still a little behind Rush idling take that fight all right lot of attention here around the mid lane control words for TSM are paying off Phoenix little bit of damage to take down Phoenix in Amarillo can you get that kill right off the bat the cloth for the sun Sons. Enough yeah they are tracking summer is here goes for the W in to Glen immediately answer they are from Acadian good. To stun him with a knock-up outside of Power Rangers are so they don't drop extra help because it could have been a Garmin collapse they knew that driving was on the bottom side if you take too long or you take too much damage from the trip there can be repercussions for that so I buy Phoenix not immediately flashing and Aura cleansing and then plastic afterwards if they are able to knock them up just outside of Power Ranger that finished off the kill without too much danger to themselves in a danger I'm going to the bottom Lane right now has more take him to come through vs or definitely pass like for Apollo boots plus the extra weapon Sears vent can definitely start to engage level six. Coming very very soon they're both about five and a quarter down during the bottom line stock market be too long away from those hard engages and we know we can easily have one rolled back by the time we get back to the galley and Alyssa so that bottle and I said absolutely happen you're going to follow in Aqaba for people who don't play like a list of the fruits definitely feel super good for your passive and laying upgrade as well as the same down there let's see if the controller also in the back of his wagon fit but you can tell they're very worried about this midlane jungle combo Lesage direct I already capitalizing for a kill and PSM a really switching objectives this time around they left Broken Blade on himself on the top side of the map and Acadian is focusing down around the dragon reschedule it taken with those little stick smoothie can feel completely screen of Sven killed
