18 10th Place 10th place this year they made playoffs one time might do it yet again right here and now battling optic gaming for that chance to do so out of themselves and talk with them they have been pleased with their growth so far this year videos staying in for the whole year as well as slightly revamp roster and they are just one game away from making in the playoffs definitely a Resurgence is well-off take also coming off that wind is already carthus and a Nivea this is the only team you see these opening bands against and I'll be in there as well as results so far and we'll see if it does come through one more time as all the frappe all the harbor comes down to this there was the one-hour break of course in The Middle's you watch CLG versus e 9th and spending that time from Memphis final match with a you know what he or perhaps there might not be able to grab in the first half the draft so that's going away the first thing that comes in my mind when I see if youis aatrox possibly opening up that it's been a pretty good answer I mean Christian has super common as well so maybe we'll see them fight over that but yeah they're DHR let me tell you a nickname here is it cool if I call do clip big do for a when he gets big dunks with Ajax I feel it is correct it going to be on the side of golden Guardians do with FBI once again they have a really high priority on the Azrael for him is specially gives him a lot of autonomy in the bottom Lane and also can allow who he could go for ROMs they found her throat not too harshly as well hear some can she might be coming through but right now it's Gangplank has the answer to a truck they're expecting both of those as top laner I like the yard Army is looking over I know he and Joker are good friends with most people are pretty good friends with me DS fellow let's see though I doubt it's going to be a your clock and I have your crumbled quite a few times but it's not going to be the case Jungle Force is very strong as well lots of things that you mentioned earlier a high priority on Ezreal FBI building has no difference silver I like a lot very good Lake Indiana. I really like it against Ezreal specifically I mean I don't play a bunch of baby carry but when I get out of build if I'm against Ezreal ultimate supposed to be most of the keys to the dead Play Feels Like a good matchup for silver to be able to farm a few you definitely a scale when you get a bunch of Chris Cooper Lake in Israel do burst damage not to be underestimated special Spike you have to be really really cognizant if the Edge Realty no spill shot turn around to go to wait a little while, like a lot very good into silver you break the record play you really cut her damaged down a lot though like it's always important to do here but it means that now you can really pinch the jungle. Dicted rush there's driving for the happened what they can also point out is that Gigi s with a counter pick on both solo length the first have to grab the Last Guardian have to pick frog and I just they're going to lose some jungle pool let's see go to Guardians have really loved this Tristana solo Lane for no both hanser and frog and see if the band's even targeted I or if optic are unconcerned with that picks so far so Johnny finds her way into this game eventually free Band Away along with some other fancy are no hard engaged for big with a nautilus that's a really difficult one with the point-and-click to deal with even for something like Brom you can't you shove your unbreakable Shield underground and type of bridge the depth charge so that's one of the few things I can get past them and you going to see a lot of Champions been at a big fool his most played Nautilus was 7 that one's gone you and me thrash dropped off as well and left so Nerf gun player either so very place would be first time or only the second time I'll split as Olaf joins the jungle bands at Contract hear one of his more play Champions by year as well as the cover is not lease it definitely would be with their breath so let's check on Lee Sid this is so dangerous that take a lot of wrist and contracts take that to a 10 if you could do it will have a lot of Austin highest at on the tibia basically there for the day I marry much doubt it because I got a lot of wealth and health regen this makes it very aggressive Fargo's in looking for trades and the first Draven hover that so often Arrow does like to play biggest fan down to Leah coming back I just saw it from this key coming back here already asked who he have his his trademark champ of the world in full and I liked what they saw it with that clean Cloud 9 team composition the roaming early on from this key so effective for C9 and Crown thinks he can do it as well I honestly think the optic have looked best when Crown has been roaming around the map making plays very good last champion form to log in and frog and we'll have the DPS machine working on the history of playing till I think back to Samsung Galaxy when they won World a lot of Thalia games with what he was known for Roman to his side Lanes getting his teammates ahead and now he's one of the more individual carry standouts but back on Comfort he was going to be exciting one definitely so and not to mention last game as well if you have a jongleur with a flash guarantee knock up that does me easier for Juliet to Landers Dodge makes up its not as sweet Jarvan because if Jarvan flashes for his knock up he doesn't land extra damage to your combo so it's definitely a little bit more work to be done here by objects but they are facing a heavy poke contradicted from the side of golden Guardians with the Ezreal Corky trying to scale Up in Smoke and then gain play pharaohs even I count as a form of poke so golden Guardians will be looking to scale it up and make it into playoffs last game everything on the line for optic and Golden Garden the got to lay it all out a Year's worth of work in the chance to go to Worlds rest on winning this game to win the ALCS on this button counter logic gaming the first round the best-of-five you got to win this one to claim 6 place and move on for the players loading onto the rest soon as they step up but you've got a couple of Samsung Galaxy on the one side like that a lot paying homage to crowns old team World championship-winning Squad and we are by the way where snowing so what do I do this game will eventually start all right quick analysis of the early item purchase contract has a deed done with the hunters machete interesting idea of their from the jungler freak all right well we got some time to feel so awfully instead of I would go to that machine thanks guys job you have had such a long day but if you and the team starting the day and now you have the final game and everything comes down to this match after a year of missing playoffs just by this much for optic so is this the explicit optic makes it also be able to answer you know it's like did yes we will go out to like even the last team in the league is still holding super hard but you sometimes you didn't get the result We Have Some Loops CT on their game that we should have one that didn't do this morning was very unfortunate like the game was pretty much a screen that usually make but it wasn't a so you can I know we have to like Wendy's game but I feel like the guys mentally she's pretty good and we're confident now it's and it's just it's going to be so let's hope that they have the right mindset is there anything special that you said to your players before sending cost of a stage I don't have the right stayed up in camera because it might be a little bit to the car but but best of luck to you in the back to the casters it's a very much awfully I already said go out there and give him a good fight word for word for word I like it it was in French it doesn't translate well yeah yeah yeah I feel like that's why I yelled at from the audience yes that's exactly reason how many French swear words do you know free I only know one side and it's not very bad at all you don't say I'm broadcast or if you really want that one so we're not going to bother seeing Axiom sing the alphabet. We're going to be the opposite of getting in the right direction far as I can tell is busy every player has left and now my game is going to close as well but soon enough we will get ourselves back in yeah it was just a small are therefore I can has the wrong Rune in a game like this you obviously cannot send someone in with a wrong Rune we have to have both teams Optimal Performance here everybody needs their fair chance to get into playoffs there's too much riding on this end. So one of the things he talked to him since we have a while for the game remake here. About the pressure of this game you know it's going to come down to the details and how well they can perform on stage this game is actually full of Veteran we have so many players with very long histories appetitive League of Legends here this is definitely going to be one of those moments where the high-pressure leadership is really tested frog in the guy on your screen there that would think a bit of League of Legends before the LCS existed that's true coz you playing in Korea as well is definitely traveled the world significantly and made this a very successful career that's the case here so looking at this right now of course we are keeping the same pics in bands has won the draft on your screen right here Champions reorder to the roles of their in and take a look down on this one I mean this is this thing about the the types of play you want to see out of each of these plays when the golden Guardians hanser has been an absolute Santa I would say the best for a member of the team he got his matchup Gangplank scales very very well and good matches laning phase really good also he's got a really good earlier as a chunk of the lease in on top of him as well and even though he doesn't tend to get a lot of Latasha really from either side he doesn't come out ahead in this match if not better than Avenue where I think ggs can definitely get a big lead and as long as he is safe to split push farther down the line with his back was just on a game we got to lead and couldn't do that I feel like he's set up well to take care of performance meanwhile again yui talked about crime and it's only at the very beginning of this draft and I think that's another player who's going to really stand out here yeah Thalia is a very very important Champion early on in the game especially waveclear you can push in the minion way very quickly and go Rome to those silent to help make plays especially important to have good Synergy with your jugular and meet us another one of those better went alongside crown and with the driving those two looking to combine for a lot of optic success over the course of the summer split it has definitely been true throughout their ups and downs these two have definitely cared a lot of weight and we expect to be true in this game as well driving by the way one of the premier junglers on this patch has moved up in the rankings with a couple of the recent nurse to the competitors I just to keep you updated on the stage right now we are having to the draft 6 chance of a locked in and seven have been banned so pretty soon we will get the rest of this crap you see on your screen locked in on their computers in a load back in the game and shouldn't have any issues anymore as we ourselves forward to the game of a day it's almost 7 p.m. here in Los Angeles and I know a lot of these teams have been here for a very long time by optic I believe I heard went home to refresh and then I came back to battle the last two hours of their games and I hope that they are ready to go in and finish out this yeah I'm taking a break going to reset is definitely important throughout the day I heard from all believe that the cloud nine players actually half of them went and got haircuts between their last Cambogia and the tiebreaker game so even your changing of the outfit coming in with a fresh look definitely could be the case your father picked I've been locked into the 40 second countdown timer ticking down and then we load in so very very soon we get back into the game out of this one then I do want to do it for me to come out big on his first board game of the split so many of his chance got banned away three Band 1 pics 1 North and so he's down to the bar here I want to see how well he can do Bart you should have a favorable interact with Brom shield and Sons at least yeah and it's also very good against poke opposition's we mention the Golden Gardens are trying to do with their team Bard ultimates can set you up for much easier flanks jarvinen aatrox can have hard time sometimes you'll getting those hardened gauges on to Azrael Corky Gangplank kind of difficult Champions to get past a Brahmin too but if you land a good Bard ultimate that can be game-changing try and set things up so we shall see ya they can use it and when you have a champion on your team that can create to rain it also helps a lot so Thalia ultimate can be used to try and Corral the enemy team into a good Bard ultimate and I can be really scary here and you did not much range right like you do if not the screen and suddenly goes nowhere to go close them yet and I have them all those things available going to be pretty excited when he dreams of the players have loaded back on in the rift the time for the last game of the day the last playoff spot up for grabs optic gaming and golden Guardians 8 and 10 to close at the regular split tiebreakers
