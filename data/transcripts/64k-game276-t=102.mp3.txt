The only question is what will their solo aim for the top side that they can get a literally trying to break down some of these Powers early on and spread out the map does not turn Comcast Israel and the block are all components that you want to flirt with a very powerful splits with your side they want to stay as 5 over Speed Booster Alistar your Jarvan to go get that heart and gave your aatrox is a great front liner utilizing the ultimate for that timing window of the revive coming back up this is a very for basing five-on-five setup that they just want to find his rhythm in North America are the top set against Sunday on the edge Rock and wanted to see broken plays irelia Riven and Yasuo it was those were all part of the YouTube highlight video CSM put out when they pick up broken play from the TCL a lot of hype was generated him coming over turkey he's really melded well with the team has gotten here let's see what we could do though because a lot of fans of and trying to Rally around this mean for a while you mention their 5 + 1 + 5 slides interesting wildcard they pulled here to switch out who Lee who he put in the soul ego time is now that make you sad that you're outside of slap you got to make up some games to play the first one who has done better and better as a split has gone later to read to me return to form they never miss an LCS finals and they missed it back to back last year the Miss World the first time ever as well just is Robert looks a bit better maybe it's their return the distributive game for them I Got Talent season with a substitution as well but it remains to be seen as totally go can step up if hundreds he's going to turn it around and find their way back into the playoffs are the four finalists LPS sitting in last place around the wrists let's go to game bathroom Buddha started out with the cowbell bangs with the sneaky cosplay that we do have a word with trolley the hunted these coach to talk about this matchup thanks guys probably so cookies out so we goes in what was the decision making behind bring your cabinet liner and today he's actually been having a really good showing at Academy and then screams has been a good performance as well so it made a lot of sense to give him a shot on the big stage even though he is planning a person who's a good mid laner had a good showing against them in scrims too weak against Spirits in some kind of excited put them in a single match up today any advice that you gave him to go against such big huge Titan in the LCS not big ones just playing against the champion Like A Champion as In Like Flint Blanc the champion and I like Champions champions he's played play against before so that's something you can deal with and he's played on the stage before seeing as how you like the emotional aspect about the crowd cheering to use it for his Advantage probably thank you so much and wishing you both the best of luck back to you guys so I think I can be summed up as turn name plates off ya play against the champion rather than the player although I'll be honest I can turn the lights off but your son is different from letting in some like flat to Mid laner you can tell her I did like what kind of talk about what he did quite well they're so super excited see how this midlane does playoff but once again the story for GSN games split push get their paw planner ahead Broken Blade keep them inside land and everyone else brass campion's around that that work well when the enemy team is very spread out now a lot of the time for guys you like that to work you do need a powerful early game start getting those towers down early and getting control of division I never recall this would be silly cuz you by the way he's at the middle and against dierksen got a triangular coming around through award so you didn't move until I am fully came through and do you want to wait a little bit more time I was told they would drop name plates that was a lie. You're going okay so far Sunday you know what spider has like three triplets use any kind of dance around do somersaults yeah I mean it when aatrox rework was first so it's like ribbon yeah broken playsets you're a pretty good job and his son there but he's doing all right for himself is it a shot Sunday Christian time anyways it does feel more like kind of like a fighting game in the top play now that we have 8 Bucks versus really I do like that you are a little bit more complex than that champion that's all right that we saw the tide game very early on no obnoxious laning phase leaves in fact it's pretty good. they told me to do what I want to pay him off well done my friend fix things on the top side and I do expect a decent amount of effort we put into that lane someday to me has been the highlight star for 100 season in their losses no getting eaten advantages sometimes for most importantly he is against one of the key players for TSM where to send a foot broken play their new player on is our town roll get the first one is well and they both go for the play this time around 100 speed jet the kill it goes to someday us blood money that's the way they want to set it up let's take another look radiant goes in here with Broken Blade all the time and they don't quite get him out of his cute as it's done came in the game continues to commit there to try and go forward someday still able to dash out though in a Honda can finish up that kill that's at the heart rate because of course with driving coming into both chose to flash the flash Ford Broken Blade flashed out and we always had an unfortunate picked the wrong play with each other that we've been examining with this team over for quite a few of their games in the ALCS been specifically with those two players they have had different ideas about how to play the game that was a very clear illustration of it one in one out as you said need to have a little bit more time I guess the to get to know the Tendencies of love your teammate feel like we're running out of time you should definitely get those down probably securely in the quarterfinals birth but he's really like a good seed and you can compare that to all the guys are pretty close and maybe only a game a half behind him with a lock ski refuse them does drop is a single game behind losing out on 3rd place better things that we did finally get some good dinner to go on top, that was definitely present for us for a while on them and on Sunday despite playing for more than a year together since last year together 100 thieves maybe getting a little better over time then why we can check in on the mid lane is well with the legal than the Academy Mid laner coming in for 100 days he's hit Level 6 on the dendra they're both going for the recalls. Waiting around because there's a big minion wave anytime is a Advantage for the enemy talk later and there's a big minion wave crashing you have to think weight are they going to try and dive are they could try and make our talk later miss out on this finding Way by forcing it that's why I gave you sitting there in the brush waiting for a counter place at looking for an offensive play good stuff though no diving the probably Gainesville to get to see a difference down here and that are up in that Top Lane even despite the hill coming through and be earlier like you buy something for him off and he's just a 90 casters to look at that I can't find a way in Sunday cutting it away after use it very high Alp and Sunday trade back defective Lee really nicely done and TP of work already down for Broken Blade and very very low health regen very well is for something is very big for the two compositions for what they want to accomplish really on in this game than 100 these can control Top Lane like this and make it very hard for kids have to actually open up the map and utilize their strengths meanwhile it's so easy for us to see through flashlight
