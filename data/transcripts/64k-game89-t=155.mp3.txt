liquid in the opening game or maybe there was a little bit too much for a couple people in the past and we can keep watching them for the table here I want to see how much they can do the Bigfoot been trying to play a lot better and we'll see you at Mass can bring to the table from stocks that on the analysts said so you know just last night we are they Dairy Center and they did lose in Academy but they've been kind of switching time and both of them vying for that position so we shall see what it turns into this game right side of Korra flyquest you got a band out from the highest Priority Care he's very cyclists are the two most band of that s t r Bennett of course it falls down no to the Azrael and a fairEOS button on the side of TSM a lot of focus on support pics here tryna been away some of those big laning supports their uni of course with Spam healing nobody ever want to play against that and then the parkway Making the Band table for now but yeah it's dropped easy early pic onto syndra this is still an incredibly highly prized Champion revali's talk about with that chap of courses so flexible and can play at bottom Lane Wednesday things me to rotate it but this is this is PSM and if it is his most play champion in 2020 he is undefeated on it still five wins on the syndra also has a crazy all-time records that will affect him todepends on it mean while Flight Risk is scaling package of no one actually flexes syndra like technically LuluAlexandra simulator and then like is the like the interesting switch up like 99 to 1 in the throat and roll it's just a bit later and remodeling but it's not even like your body flame player of course I can't afford to take 73 games in his career so more bands coming through though before troll hear from the fewest and they lock in the engaged for for bowel Frost and speak against the run it back on Glisan I know surprise after the performance yesterday yeah I want to see the kind of thing goingreally like to swing on the whole another good one out here today against this feels like a really tight battle screens mother really really top teams it's going to take awhile to figure out exactly how everything has taken us three undefeated teams right now who all it really really scary but talk to you and them is that honestly should be in the hat that you could be able to drop Ramen I want to know which one is going to find a second loss today because I think they're both deserving of positive win rates overall in the ALCS Empower people after the Cinderella was taken away as well they're still want to play that one again and put on there on a backline Carrie and did you notice the LeBlanc band freak so it's definitely respecting the send reflect their ability down to down to doublelift and don't want to get surprised with a terrible LeBlanc pick in the end and they will save their last pay4 power of people a lot of sense that you know the main character of the team especially since match is being subbed in and they drafted a triple Frontline it has grade engage ability to shred the enemy front line however puts a lot of pressure on Match is being sucked in a long will power be able to be there to carry team and play safe with today overreacted analyst behind the times and it was actually on the boulevard train already and you would rather I just wanted to surprisetell me more. This is probably going to be the tanks It Again lyrics and has been spamming it and I talked about it yesterday but you go after shock you feel Tanki early on you or your drain has no limit on the targets for the W so you can easily shove the wave over and over and have a bunch of sustained and then pukes in can look to you both side lengths try to make plays with the ultimate again like a highlight in the last game vision is your number one priority when you're playing the champion till 6 now has another passive on the Q wear if you're out of dishes out of combat / 2.5 seconds you get extra fears with whatever damaging ability and then you can still use your targeted fear that he wants someone elsejust yet and I'm sure that you got coverage on right into this one so fair trade Motors going to be like at full HP forever I thought they could be a drain site that the Orleans going to want to listen to that one plays out overtime still going to be a very exciting match between these things because I'll be certainly flyquest got to see was going on right there. To watch the game from yesterday they knew it was available in the draft they said they knew take photos to be a possibility and they're right side is it okay as long as we are, and what Pixar left available is here is the one here then wait and see what happens and then try to go to the rain gauge it is popular and so like you like I said I've seen this keep playing it as in addition to barracks and so are getting some time in on the champ I think you hit the nail on the head I think we're going to see another of the Conqueror of all of bears you can go press the attack from or first damage but you're fighting itone more sustain looks like we got another three of you it's the grasp for volibear broken play going to get a bit more Tanki when going for those trades storing up that extra HP is going to allow him to play short trade that you're going to mentioning right just just the one hit them back out cuz word might not let it hit for very long time and that one plays out early and so is uniquely fairy weak to Sandra in the one on one of course Leona does not have damaged blocking write can't show teammate can't block me to Braums Shield so at 6 tell if you a lot of damage on believe this should be a safe will take it to her son to go to the queue Mash will be back in Lane in time if used to leash to Blue buffing you do that as wellhello it's Siri about the Solas fairly deep Ward here going to see probably this blue star nobody from TSM was around to see him place that Ward okay that can definitely matter here is solo going to be slowed broke a blade not going to get to slap but hey how far is he control 3 control C control 3 in of dance I am available to you right there got to take those opportunities are important to finish the channel on that because you get 60% of the cooldown refunded to finish it or kill off stuff and you also have a big burst damage at the end but I don't even care to automate I'm going to be like a minute anyway you're not going to do anything meaningful who cares about this one in the big thing is getting all three main lights first on the second wave that can you go to first love to all in there is trunk one there's trunk to sinner part place in a second he's going to have it and you can see how far run respect with the Reagan who look like and you also see you know who gets the duty of killing off the minion himself right I ignore trying to press up letting Mash tag last one because the one that's I need to cool off the initiation there people try and get into range for for the timing but everybody well aware of the level to power Spike it's been talked about for years I know a man who did I also feel like you I highly recommend sew-in no tank Fiddlesticks if you get Auto Field to Midland because it does remove some of the like mechanics do you normally have to pull off in in Midland and your objective is a lot clearer with this Champion specially for me and Uncle are you taking me opportunity to counter jungle while we've got a top Scuttle being taken by Speaker that's very important vision and safety for volibear on the top side of the map so that Broken Blade can play aggressively in this matchup it's one of the things you want to take advantage of from your champ select where you're able to get that has vanished with the ghost text cuddle as well as steal away most of the opposing Raptor Camp speaker can I get one more small chicken compared to know he's very efficient Gangsta we didn't waste any time sitting in that tribe Rush ignorant mediately I guess you're all in on to file Frost through a sphere at mash and then tried to stun I think I might need to see the replay to see if he actually got this done on his Scout of the week though it looks like only the slow and that would pause some of the damage delays some of the follow-up from Mash. Here's another look at it right out of the brush he just got ya right out of the box of fries combo on to buy I'll do the emote stacked up the first Blood passive email already has a good job by him as we have a small coffee early game you can see a gigantic Farm Lido to Broken Blade toppling does not look fun for fill a suorin right now to do a broken play definitely can be an outstanding later and one of the players that can take over again from the top side all right back out on the maps speaking valve Fox kind of work together to invade and get some Vision they walked over a lot of words that were previously placed by flyquest Osos and turn won't be caught off-guard and should know to sweep as he's walking through his own jungle I'm walking the dog right now in a pair and we'll see if Central and Cody run has stopped him in time no vision I believe in this brush but to be afraid down here ignores says hello it's he's old, please. Rain for the rest of the wall just in the right spot and by the way Center in right behind them singing Sun comes out look at the counter gang it's beautiful on a double kill you know the trailing information of the flag plus towards that speaking valve entered on to go on this long path towards bottom sides giving flyquest enough time to set up a reaction here now to kills on to match with the counter gank ear for fly Quest plus sent to her and gets beat down this dragon with nobody intervening huge huge start now for flight Quest Deluxe double thumbs up by the way from Santora's Awards of the walls again California speed rained in the truck coming through Pearson not a problem but he's slow and he's going to rain she'll stay alive the truck comes down to triplets going to fall great. Can't go bottom because bottom just got turned around on them so takes the opportunity to still look for a proactive play there's another look at a Santorum coming down over with the blast, though as soon as I see biofrost centaurs already in position they know he's here rebs might they just annihilate him there with your failures and then really nice pillar as well from santorin they get the double on the mash you get subbed in from Academy and boom double kill already free 10 minutes on Ophelia's Masters got to feel great already upgraded Surfer grease on top of the BF sword yeah beneficiary some really smart. Play by the squad I want to know who called for what the jungler just knows back when you can get the time sometimes that's just the hood of Ace in your back pocket that no one realized without trade still the top side yoga smell back he's been in that one solo finds fight really the slow not getting
