have their work cut out for them spy certainly a very solid team why would not describe them as explosive Oriental early game action they have a great fundamentals and they are very thought of you allowed them to get into their group and that really is about fighting Round Table a late-game set up around there and they are a strong team in that regard highly aggressive skin deep valley game and shoot point on a Tappan and on something like the Cassiopeia can also take it to you in the landing phase as well and I think the day of the areas of the drop that I would prioritize if I'm supplies we expect to be on a scaling fritztile Katy Perry but I want to see Jessie and humanoid be able to take it to the mid to be too and maybe even try and help that although I may end up with everything going to have to really step up here you know someone who I've been receiving criticism throughout the plans for not necessarily really performing not to the level that he was expecting and he's going to be going up against Taro soupincredibly strong player one of the best sarm is region and I'm looking for himself in the International Date Casey the current Opera we was being in that pasta 5S as you all well free dance goes with every single game and now if you really want something like a gang plank you know why he's going to have much more freedom to play his style of League of Legends in game Packers game time card engage locked in for a slice of brackets in the jungle Nautilus down and support and meanwhile Freightliners here for game with the Tristana top or mid laner and then we have to show me your analytical proud it is really hard to know right because this is a team that can really throw a wrench in the gearsare going to play a mage bottom getting cinder box or stone in mid and a colleague. I would be my prediction doesn't mean I'm going to be right on even a single one but this is a team that White Plain on saying if it likes to challenge you and I don't think that it make sense to put Tristana in the bottom Lane and and play a scalar against the likes of coffee because that is his game and and gametes play Greta Van sole interest on a can do that. Because I think they thought that the Gangplank was going to come Mossman Gangplank and Minnie not also doesn't deal with them very well either so I would expect there'll be able to pick that one up exactly right you got to throw everything out the window when you think of that game going to think about how they going to attack the lane as opposed to how they going to make it to team fighting right because they do do that you very early and I honestly wouldn't even be shocked to see them go for something like and ignite dress right you know these are the kind of place that they are willing to actually go for a TriStar with ptak is a very strong leaner and any real rage masses can be a difficulty 4 games like in the early gameI can be knocking down those barrels and if you do want to go super aggressive and look for something like he might look for these early aggressive Blaze IDP can be a threat you know even free 6 1304 Gambier is the kite the anxiety bog-standard Marksman carries the bot Lane already off the table here in this role if we want to go for Cassiopeia actually use the drop off there after he played really nicely only a tankless lineup show that use going to be bred from the akali and if you don't get on top of them they will just wait and I also raxiom really think this intelligent given the style they are going to bring forth right you know what we know is going to do all this crazy stuff we're not sure who's going to be late to play a defensive Marksman play a marksman that can scale up that can play some what's safe and survive you know that early stages because I do things by themselves up in front of the Wild for the later you ate the last pick to grab the mid laner most likely here can still be flexible. These acacian as L'Occitane how do you say you like the scaling do you like the fact they going to have any pro activity in their Lane it going to be on humanoids to generate some form of pressure he he will go towards a LeBlanc but I feel like so much of this I really gain what kind of pushing to be like in otherwise the map will just collapse that is generally how they do actually play it out in funnily enough we may end up getting it just thought of it and if I actually was right that I'm shocked but you're certainly some ability to actually bought these rounds and it is going to be non-standard right is going to be syndrome playing in the bottom Lane would be surprised if they don't remove the dress up to the Top Lane but you certainly you can play that is very effectively and if you are going to be able to get the Bush on the Block you can threaten those to replace it is actually going to be to set up here so volleytalk Tris mid-century bought yeah I'm in regardless I don't think any of these lanes are great blockchain reveals through cell so that lock your players around none of those feelings are great for her I put dangling advantages well we can keep in mind is that even if they are putting up against the game plank anyway, because Wally Greek Holly doesn't have any of the most dominant matchup you can survive a lot of them but certainly Tristana is very threatening not into that DP for half so they're feeling it's a little bit too dangerous Summoners War Rift Oasis we close out day one of the worlds group stage for the battle between gametes from the LEC is it going to be a very interesting battle number one team in Vietnam number three from Europe play fighting the regional qualifier the short run to the playoffs but made them work for it and got away two worlds got through the play in stage as well Gamo very strong team Chrysler playoffs putting you out together this split swapped into new players are role swap to more you look so what's up I normally use for my set jol is an absolute mess everywhere to separate support find free games each throughout their playoff run as well however they didn't have a really good split once I found any form of consistency in their lineup in you know just to continue the narrative essay also deal well with a tile style League of Legends it had low-key trying to throw all the questions at them as well so this is a team that not only played really quick and explosive himself but once I can deal with it very well in the 80s is that slow down the frustrations dialed has been they know their kind of play style for quite some time and no they do is going to be as crazy as gam but there are extremely proactive very aggressive like G2 that they are having to deal with him and honestly they have not until well with them but the question is is gam of that caliber are they able to new run over twice in the early game like to meet other great LEC to use can do it's almost impossible to actually fight back into this we are seeing jockey though and handling the stop playing pretty well utilizing grab that she poked out zeros in Terrace really just need to get the wave in the Torah and basic needs to get a reset off your and that is why you trying to shut the hell up here he knows that there's a could be in and this is actually a pretty difficult spot for him he's putting himself at risk is he's killed just yet I have to go I have to self waiting for that cool down is the blues going to be taking Levi is around C's okay in the river so you can burn the W that's why I wasn't allowed in the burn the spell energy trying to complete that shop in this could come around that she would have seen as far as though they were watching Levi new side that we now see the Cosmic Pegasus I'm not going to be any engagement through the back side it again jumped over takes damage map showing himself to think a little bit of arrangement in a gross or didn't fully get into the turret in the dip with zeros in a pretty awkward spot but it's going to be able to be comfortably pushed in Leakey I had so much fun at Camp Lucy sides of the map and being a big impact that's why I thought you meant we would go something very aggressive obviously LeBlanc wants level 6 does rate should have killed for it on this Tristana but we press the attack with a knife I feel like they should be a very good Lane bokeelia and certainly can be in and honestly you can post 6 if you're willing to itemize for the match of go over things like in early next Rinker it can be difficult for the block to actually have enough damage to pull push through that Shield you know until you are going to further on into the game and even talk. He's running going plating right he's got some defensive stats in here as well for the route of the MRI as well so it is a choice after all of course is feeling like Chris and I are going to be playing in Temple Emma and I think that you know this has been a very standed include early game so far. Flat bread bought was stolen away but now we put it in boots outfit available you would expect that I say to look to make his first real meaningful impactful gang on the map as long as you keep your flat and have predator on Disney the unrivaled with the amount of damage do you bring through these early case, because if you are the ones that are the site off and is kha'zix is there to actually you answer that game by the since early births down in August so incredibly fast and that is that Levi is going to be looking for these isolated fights in these fights where he can actually answer and how people can of opting in and committed to it and then look for the engaged play against midline priority right so you have to look at every single fight and kill them before he is room is there and it's a losing fight so every time he goes from one of these days one of these Shadows he has to know that she puts the Ulta on in and out the following Audi's going to go watch The Flash this project completely sold out the dragon on the other side of the map and getting ocean at 6:30 so big for your laning phase it almost gives you like a get-out-of-jail-free matchup this is to be feeling very very good really across-the-board impact Cassandra that's one of the weaknesses of the early game off the bottom light Mages and assure that certainly doesn't and even for the akali and of Champions without man of people often look too and say all right we'll do it and doesn't really do much for you, but in a map where you actually have the bush you can absorb the poke your from GP while you're actually spending all your energy thing to try to push it out and then simply backup and Regent you know with that ocean Dragon so certainly nice take away I'm just going to feeling good this early on a really cute directly to look forward to go for on Orlando would it be named after the candidate getting out of Lane and making sure that he's supporting the other way and he's also on a really good timing on call Desiree sense or no Nation the bottom line what kind of fluidity that we come to you know what you expect to be led by here early on we haven't seen more more what does it more item upgrade looking to get more gold generation in the early games of e3 is going to have to try to make some plays to justify this by instead of just upgrading for your Target on since you have to think of how Pike whoops map State and what he was actually being able to do it so Noble support they want to go generation because so much of a goat is face off the back of that. That's going to be really much of anything is he still too far away to get him anyone else but actually getting to right out of that. Now the top side walking away traded blows everywhere that humanoid down the 2/3 but hit me hard as well and very careful here learn the facts going to stay alive is the across the ocean now kicking in so he is going to stay in backup quite quickly during the song that you could be proud
