do the maid sizes come around but we see so many marksmen Love For the First Time ultimate double play something other than Paisa three straight so far Rift Rivals 2018 and now a new Champion for him than relying on that when a force flight study for them have gone 0 and 3 on the tournament so far but this would be the upset for all upset for Europe to get fast Tekken game leading the blind pig face the relay the fans are happy for the first man and I can have a repeat at least they won't turn over in the other Rift Rivals available things like you really are for pobelter is upstage Ronnie and trundle but usually the highest in terms of band priority but if you want to get yourself somethingand I mean it hasn't been talked about that much but in fact there's three Gangplank game every single game here for Team Liquid he has look good and some not so good in others as soon as he had that a seven-game people started to jump on them but no one bad game is going to dissuade them from going for that Global going for the damage from stop this game playing over to impact they don't normally canvas they have not been a huge amount of time playing through that talk language it's been one of the biggest criticisms towards flight because when impact was put behind on that game might be to demonstrate a very quickly took control of the rest of the dayI'll see if I can take control to the top and right now to look at the midline is going to be locked in for in it was probably been there best performer at this tournament the Zoe play even though they got pretty blasted in that game he was able to find the pics and he is able to look for the bubbles across the walls and I'm trying to wrap the jungler as well the problem is I feel like you're now asking holdouts to pick up the rough cut my job in the opposite direction in the summer split Rift Rivals and put them to be his stick cirelli a game if it does get locked in here and I don't see a reason to lie right not to be a part of the key is Team Liquid almost always pair the irelia with the said one he fromjungle very quickly there with another male a champion go for the kills with the matchup that's what it's all about trying to get that first damage and just a little bit of Sun is going to go a long way they have obvious of tapes you can move out the way he come back where you came from Sonu blinks out to sleep as late as well they could look very very good place to looking for a bit of a relief pressure as well with trundle of course quite a good fighter in the early game plan get rid of some of that pressure and if I like the one of her greatest strength who wins head up with something that I don't know where it's going to go dance because we haven't seenproficiency off but I mean to be there spice up until Christmas Eve so far been kind to them a beautiful start to bring things around again a very nice when it would be for European I getting rid of bed fit counters to the Moon do in the Top Lane Darius thing as one of them to match upstairs and show me Focus panzones was the top speed of an active things like mold Donna wrong time is really strong support the Cat come to take for the sink I still available and If I could but be bad I'm at you but if you're going to play tank to tank which is likely twice just looking at something like an on-set fine with that and it can actually give themhaven't heard anything back yet or are trying to whittle down on some of the other attack damage by possible threats that could come out from twice because having Mundo ever and always wants to talk about how good it is against magic damage with the extra bonus that he gets for his magic resist and with Heimerdinger usually be played in bottom Lane now that wouldn't leave a lot of extra space for him to come in from the Top Lane so basically it's a bunch of bands from slice and two things that they will just played so far this Split Rock on lower the chance of playing Sia asriel and Vladimir off the table to Kaiser band early in the summer split now with whatever he's going to lock up last year on the roster of course they are a bit different here they have most of shape has been locked into need to stop playing around us to Fort most likely and the pick against dr. Mundosharpen to be graphed you and I'm actually still not certain of us actually Jarvan top I feel like it's not a great-aunt I lose a match up but I believe this was played over in the lck bike on he likes the kind of overly aggressive match has been what do you think about the two of us has to again with a trundle on a job and you have a lot of damage with the job in front of the door so I feel like that that goal is to potentially camping just shut down there was a strategy that you would yesterday also Jarvis did get some but not on the recent fact that were on you a couple of seconds off of the flag early on so we'll see if those come to fruition in the top side but that's about to attack damage threats Force play Not only from the support Pike is actually perfect around a.com the big light pollution from the bottom in for Team Liquid doubleliftI feel like they might be able to go aggressive and we know the SS on the champion it is very possible for him and if he's going to find those advantages it will be using playing on window very effective against many of the SS on his Lucius with the possibility of Brahms done that is actually pretty decently easy to outplay a Pike in the bottom line with the Phantom undertale really being the only ability that's going to concern you when you go forcall in and if he does use that a little bit early then he was we could easily go for a killing killing for them self and that's the debate is possible now in roaming around the map with the Zoey with the job and try to get killed elsewhere because the walk for and I'm excited to see how the jungle is match up because it feels like a whole lot of length that can put pressure on them and if he can get out of going to be excited to hear we are in the game versus Team Liquid the finals of the North American European Rift Rivals of 121 scoreline between the regions so far splice definitely large Underdog that one upset it would be to pick this one up Rhonda the rift want to see how they can dodo my eyes will be on good say because I feel like that you could look for a very early gang up in the top Play No do I make him just let the way pushing just a little bit suicide go from Red Springs to talk and see if they can do I sound level to spike of a job and maybe. Or even get a kill down onto impact actually these two junglers I believed her say he was your first lccs all LCS team jungle for spring what's Mickey was hours so we have a bit of a match up here of the two so this is going to be the important part of this one it is not going to be alright infinite gold lead can't come back from this over hey by kabi double is now a 10 extra goldhe's got a run for his money here in this one felt going to walk back in a bit and find this key Hotel play the queue it doesn't this car stereo player electrical popping as well as a pretty decent trade just for double or I mean for pobelter even trying to get back in the minion range here as a little short cast there on the paddle Stars this is something that many events like to do to a red-ear basically they just use the range Advantage trying his own her away from the farm as much as possible and they consider that because she's quite a lineal champion in the sense that when she was so cute she was in a line and that when she uses her also in another line yeah you can actually kind of Punisher using Yuri she she doesn't have it depends on when I'm out of the tube that Mobility is when did you take geometry okay masks as they call it. Misky yeah that was pretty nice right there no Smite for a Smithy good pick up there for the zone how can I sell E I just say that you so keep your eyes on front of the gametophyte as potential to look for a tub Lane gang is 50 it stealing away the Raptors they often you up for was the top side and there is Toronto heading around the right now just going for Croghan the top to the map of the area surrounding on to the impact could be a corporate pick up my charge a capacitor in the left hand side of my life on the side of splice impact position perfectly just as the minion wave arrived two meanings that although I may get stuck underneath the time I see the flash out an impact on a lot of Team Liquid into spring as well when teams would focus on impact he would constantly absorb the pressure use as little cool Downs as possible and that would allow A Team Liquid to focus on double lift and a bottom side of the map which is where they won most of their games also call me back to that midlane fight their nisky did have a challenging Smite for Zoe I was able to pick that one up with the w before heading over to the Scuttle crab in the river and right now picking up push right back but it is a farm leave so far for double to no lie so that's going to be going pretty well that was one of the preeminent laners in Western League of Legends so far on this one of the audience and a 50w channel then go out to take a lot though he's not as long as well and I felt these really helping actually still friend is giving you the game got a selfie lend a couple hundred so damn good night picking up extra Summoner spells is definitely a valuable tool to have a lot of people are infuriated by this Champion he's also a table right there to even though he didn't plan harassment on Battlestar right through it Missy though this is the matchups still take damage but I'll take a look at their not quite winning these trade in 1/8 c s bleed for this key for that was before that is outlining who made you his sister just helping to push so that his meal and I can either go back to Batesville maybe get a beautiful Vision down you have to keep our eyes on him as well because you can see that it's going to be a lot of moving parts from the side of splice early pressure with the heimendinger in the bot Lane and 50 just want to let him base right now but it keeps getting attacked with a pillow good job saving that we're not going to get turned around but this is a lot of Midland freshman if you did a great job controlling this Lane and of course there's to help me out and keep your eyes on kissing every time a bit of action is happening on the map he's roaming around splice showing up today splice find an early game Advantage they go against the trend of falling behind sofa and Rift Rivals and getting it again Steely liquid is such a huge thing diving right into that brush stopping the back digging up The Kill for the bottom lane and then just ask for a cherry on top for the tape down on the Smithy the trundle it said why do you match up is one of the classic counters that we see but usually the big effectiveness of money over to me there's another look at you seeing finding him in the brush and then oh I hear flashes to get the unbreakable does gets done. So he can't reposition in time there, just moved to the side and nail him in the head with the ranch and then she tries to go for a school impact has
