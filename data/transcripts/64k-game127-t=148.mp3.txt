hoping for playoffs you rent a cabin we do over the LCS there's no 12 and once you have the top and cops were only at 10 and 3 at number one right here I mean it go from 10 to 5 with us tonight Place Like These are fairly close together team TSM the cells with yellow busy at six and seven winds at these needs to the traffic on the bottom side right there and honestly could be fun to watch the Cubs play out pretty interesting Corky is the air I think not the most exciting how dare you in a little while it's back yeah it is dhokla it was always a strong GP player in the ALCS in and this is a guy who I think can make a lot out of his lady always going to have an interesting place down when he was playing with optic use very slippery focused and that was always something that they were able to play around so I'm giving this matchup if you can get to add this is an opportunity for TFM play heavily through sidelinesdo it honestly be fun to see him back on a high-performing game and he all right now forced to evacuate their runs out of the Jungle 80th and Layton beige good luck everybody can o'loughlin's relations but TL are coming back down by the way I look for verses 3 they do not have I could have stopped him to go to call Jake is here which he doesn't burn TP means we'll lose some XP review think of that you ran all the way down here now we have to run all the way back up they might not even get the blue book anyways I was going to like to come down to us might buy Powerball now moving the ball 7 the first wave so he has to sit there and take up the Farm is there pushing in TSM might find the sons are close to several cows One auto away shrimps are only two blue is like the reset here we're trading blows back and forth and I believe again there is an XP Delta now in the top side but I will rise early in Vedicjust now because after getting to his Red Bluff the walls are pretty much already cleared your picture and bars with your car will get little bit of the Head Start there and I obviously owe off to the faster than gragas so may not really amount to much but back and forth it does cost a summer off of both of the supports also worth noting worth noting it is actually, I believe it's definitely speaking if you're going to do so many rush and kind of word dependence on Courtney to be that consistency worth of damage as a mid-length obviously a marksman as well but it's going to be doing that again so I can take that much threat permit in a long form team fight to be gone the next camp and as you mentioned you off really fast we are very Auto Tech Vapes super it needs to man up but I'll let you know what the blue bus going to feel pretty safeso off they go to next pieces and everything else you too we just get sacked and they now see each other let me know where is because then it's going to make sure if I feel pretty big clearing that fell on the bottom side probably speaker with know how dangerous to go down there either way but definitely don't want to run into a walk in the jungle play Spragga sent you with shrimp I actually read sitting here after that boat's I clear because going to be able to deal with the homies can't see will get the rapper and cook it is it go from work because he has another charge of might have bailable Don't Care Bar could be in for a little bit of work here if he does run into him and leave the last check with his barn in does is there sure you're denied his own Red Bluff but will be hit big trucks go to invade to Camp lead to them being steals you Stewie deal because this means for Empire guess you can eventually clear out these grubs but there's less total came to clear because basis he has a better by if you do get a chili pie and he comes out with three camps to clear where it's now turn fire will finish this up and really not have a lot to do is going to be able to try to look for it but that's also kind of covered by what they got done with this in baby another Ward you all the angles that share in fire could look towards to gank or colored something from to do the top side of the first evolved who is running away and he's going to be fine he's the ward can't kill it because it's Too Faced X that is 6 Q not Landing or maybe Ron burns the flash thankfully it does turn fire bought way it is around you never walk away by the flashlights jungle on both sides that are not the best thing to avoid this slow but still got tagged by the barrel so kind of feeling on two accounts there and does allow shernfire to limp away and what could have been the first what is still going to be taken away and if you wait in the camps are sponsoring bars back his bottom side of the map does going to have a chance at Absolute secrecy the party he did that really first recall for boots that he could start using predator and as tactical CZ comes down 10 they focus cow with the extra clothes Here Comes The Front Climbing a pole and Askew and the exhaust SoCal when will he bring the Flash's actor and he just really thick skin spots the Gangplank old almost kill will not come through the breach very very low but all the supports walkaway expensive on both sides it wasn't gplc so that it's going to be more careful in that don't have that to bail yourself out of could go in chicken Saveur are leaving overall but perhaps you were thinking hey I'm going to have more of the same in the long run and utilizing the fleet footwork and you know maybe if we sprayed like this I guess I feel back up and then take control of the lane county that does end up being the case higher region on the Corky so I can see the address of trade close at all it does work out long-term midterm for you nice pull back of damage can take it so quick as you know why that I'm grasping is a pendulum with it whatever but I do think that if you're going to take that for her plate. How would you rather have you want to have that feeling on you being the fact that you can go call you know and be able to scale happily towards the triforces to be feeling really really good of course you can make big plays on the side of me we saw it earlier today Broken Blade actually tell her she's taking over that TSM game on the deck so I don't have to be super worried but I think all things considered guess I'm going pretty happy with what's happening in the top left-hand for tactical off of recalling and that is going to be Lee palette iberus coming through of course the in about a year ago a ton of Great Valley I just got out of the shop so I can know you can see that build work out pretty nicely and the Tom catch can resuscitate someone if it does come through so I really am curious how this concert going to line up and deal. We'll work well rocket Holcomb forky alongside the fairest if someone gets low you harden Gatewood gragas I feel like it's very likely to get them finished that kill UPS no flash so I'm going to be on your side with that one blank Bud we will have to find out what is going on some level of security issues here today are you and I actually couldn't watch the Champion Select earlier on so we got kicked out during it but you don't have to wait then coming out with nowhere to go he's going to die in the first place for speaker I was just waiting because you committed so hard for there to be like a cow gets turned into a burger or something there is no fun that is beneath you that is true I was caught I was bluffing and I hope you wouldn't call it Edmond you called it I did if you were someone else with my first day in around each other makes them rich and hey Drake comes over too well filem I know that's scary I was nice those bad things for me for you all right employ the same job for 10 years 5-7 is up your way you know this is all right side by Nicki Jenkins is going to be going for the trip play he's able to grab it so he's having pressure in this matchup and they're probably has been cutting pressure there is a game of all that is touring with an old deck can't land and there was no way out speakers and thank you for the leash by jungle take me down pretty easily there let's watch this one more time this has to be picked on how this is something that is simple but often times over looking for his return to where you for Summoners is the way the frustration to be when you see when they never regained for Bashas up this time they come back they kill off now knowing you didn't have a summers no way to get out once he's still have the mobility on Tom casso the good punished from them and speak picked up another going topside now out to that 200 start on Oahu wants to be playing for my head because this is really a one-dimensional champion at them and you win or you lose your head you win more than you don't know when the time is always dead I feel like you say I asked you and Matt will it down one way or the other. The end of regardless lost is still feeling comfortable has a hundred gold assist to make him happy and we've got a saw with 600 goals lead for TSM liquid though I've been a consistently strong team ever since this roster came together with their intended starting jungler 6 and 1 which is true but can make it 7 but dies I've been doing very well so glad you're on the top side hasn't seen out and really a most you few lines with Yoshi Asian fusion Freehold you have been slammed before that actually probably as well as preaching the power you have in those barrels to actually make it very easy to scratch the back line the end and start to really pick up on that passive what you would like to get bored pretty quickly at your door at grow and just be purchased that just went out to eat in casket out of current rain total in the wall and don't want to go to help for all of it to him in a Flash go away the flash to follow and Team Liquid find a sweet guy with the topless yeah they are able to knock him down working with even on the Rhone there to back him up he's going to get his and her two lost from you whatsoever The Elf on the Shelf a great dive on that top side able to punish do puffer really the first time this game I really like every piece of that dive right there so and Shelly over the wall once you take Sacro I'm just going to walk at you from behind and there is no way you dodged his body plan really really nicely done he was going to head up with executed Team Liquid Fire back in the lineup looking to make it another wind picked up and they've gotten the game a lot closer to go to fart but TSM don't have that first break I wonder if I just ran straight down and it's a pretty thought that was George Strait at the dragon and then try to flash the cat basically it is it is far right but maybe a better chance that Haymaker you see so many players flashing that line and still get back by the end of it though listo 40th I'm not losing hole turret so that is still up for grabs here now again I find the top and side for shrimp are us a flat surface will not let him go speakers aggressive several camps and now with the clouds race just about to spawn TSN feeling pretty sure if I was going to make you feel really really good that's kind of the biggest play making tool that TLA do have to have to be able to get access to people like the MF and like this is there they want to you like that and dragon flash or treating at your house before that has a lot of going to feel good they are trying to give respect go to the back of her door was locked and the package is available for you to eat those kids they need to be gathered up and looks like you're going to be happy to just try to trade it for a plate or two of them at top five but Deca test grouping up in the bottom River cloudraker coupon for them to go to the ocean here lots of tiny fruit do they have a pretty strong, at this point in the game you know Emma have a lot of ways I feel like directly into this drama get double Marksman and usually pretty thing that made me to feel like they really need to be Olaf also be down as well and I believe he has done it's okay we can wait a little bit of this one will see if the scale pretty well and one Dragon really not a big deal but usually you see any Olaf from ahead and wants to fight early because you are much weaker and weaker than later they know they have the ability Center.
