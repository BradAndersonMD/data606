in summer it's not been the same if they are actually very heavily on the players as they've all been kind of vocal about how disappointed they are because they expect so many wins for themselves would be too specially though I have to say something and you look very good you know in their game yesterday even though they lost he had a good run did not make a lot of us are probably at is Rutgers game of the year so far he was dealing with the lane where they had ruin on the come Midland with the counter pick and he got focused quite a lot will do we can bounce back in this game is all ready to throw into fans out irelia and a collie off the table on the side of life Quest Karma after the Bluffs in 912 going to be off the table as well so far you me as being left up and we know what's available here as well to be traded Sports we'll see what actually come through another Swan as it isstrong ones who is the queen of the path right now I think almost every single team will be doing the first fix one of my points League of Legends sivir I mean you guys deliver that you got a bunch of the 49er lady attack speed level 140 is always super threatening people always have to keep their eyes out for flyquest on the side of turtle and was just going to be a second LCS game with the squad and already they're locking in the sport event work on one each on four other Champions has been engaged to Linda of the teamand has like an aggregate 80% go to the patient they are doing a lot of work right here I'm going to come through to keep the alliance against Time cast videos of Europe is one of the primary Champion for him so this is definitely going to be a comfort pick as well we should I use fairly effectively in the last game ever was spell shield and Tom can should be buried State rolled right now junglers and bought winners have been grabbed flag that's got first dibs on the most 50% presents in for a flightpoppy dropped off the table here against fake God and his ear drops Mexico Belton they don't want one of those carrots be stopped by a poppy you know it's generally does the split by the way is vipers Riven Jack Van is some restarts I got to say cuz I haven't seen him play it so far this year even on the team has and don't stop playing Jacks and apparently what would counter pick what life wants to play so Hennessey's maybe grab a mid laner first and then we see what life or blind is about the scaling and you know. About I question your lane so maybe they are worried about something that is going to tell them they were on their team with a substantial Frontline already and was that type of Frontline I was probably already looking for 5 quest to feel something off for Viper dinner now for me it is still used infrequently in the jungle I think it is very rare cases where you need to go ball early but Top Lane I think he's still a Powerhouse I honestly think it's an underused Top Lane Champion right now you get your Tiamat early try and get waves clear and then you go turn roaming for gang much like an old junker would accept that you had a farm with experience and pop play money and you get to have the same old powerful when do you want situation and nobody Mobility on the champion here and that we proclaim a view go for a gunblade at the senior one-v-one but it's almost always actually build a car build said he will go on it but it's a rarity nowadays so can induce me on the top when is iftar for you is he here hoping to repeat himself from yesterday's game where was a very very weak performance was counterpick but I think he has a very very strong are they done with the back him up and this could be a pretty good field day for pobelter engaged tools Netflix can be very reliable here as well Flack what does Juanita mean my bad either both of them have ganking often does why he plays Camille in stained red meanwhile trundle is actually an effective ganger with a Victor because wow a victory by himself very good Atlanta and a trundle by combine them pillar plus the gravity field does usually burn a flashed by themselves so it was a very low cool down abilities so could be so kind of surprisingly good combination definitely agree we'll see if it does come through and they can start picking a part sew in the middle anger is not have natural escapes. Two teams near the bottom of the standings of 226 over hundred thieves they put you back in the lineup in subbed out someday as a result and it's been working for them 2 5/2 y + hope you like the trip with the deed now starting at this week could not find the win open it today is the day 8 turns around w a one-week break for these teams regardless as they sit from home and watch Rift Rivals just outside of making it into refer I was just outside of qualifying that you know it's spring playoff team strong performance from them lot of people had super high hopes and I know they did themselves so they're still looking to climb back up the standings with so many teams so close it's very much viable for anything in the entire lead to make playoffs right now if you make a run yep yeah 6 play something to look for in 3 right now this is certainly doable and well within reach next couple of weeks 6% off an interesting enough water does not find the poke on to review at the angle not the range though it's going to be a top side start for both junglers by the way and turn on the red wine has gone with the Talisman so I expect clearing most of the AOE camps down on the bottom side after starting clueless transition and we might even see some bottomley Focus they're generally a Camille Canon matchup Camille actually is very powerful in short trades news so good because of the passive Shield that pops up in the first name as you can get with your cues she would like very short trades where is Kenan any sort of extended interaction is going to be in the favor of Ken and get to abuser Reigns match up against a cat around through the brush dropping minion aggro throwing out constant harassment so early levels especially that is going to mean that by four tries to avoid as much damage as possible and as much interaction as possible I'll just sneak minions what is going to be a conqueror Camille here we do see comments sometimes for the just W trading to make the middle of the lane a little bit easier but is going for the more all in all in actually kill someone so we see the bot Lane trading back and forth between both sides but it is a flak vest with the bush and these walking back here then go has yet to drop NEC Aston that's going to feel pretty nice because you just feel confident going to invade next you have 10 well he's definitely been confident you know in the last week or so if you can 2 weeks and showing up on stage been playing a lot more aggressively than usual see if it holds true on this dire right now again as we mentioned. Cooler starting topside so they're transitioning down bottom and amazing Sports to the party on the ward hit ya swept away with the lightning surge but oh my that is paint with you all live for Cocker freak he's able to project buy a bird hits the sun is the trade their God lives that low HB starting a door and slayed means that he is going to have a much rougher time in this Lane and helps out by for a lot like the ascent touring makes a pass on the top side of the map now because getting a steelhead early would be you do not quite worth Soldier walks back away don't believe he's part of a trundle W but may have and you know we're trying to lay there like I came up on chickens for Santorum though he got both of them pobelter walking into the brush lands the slow yep uses the exhaust that he picked up with the spell thief so do big costume of a natural looking for Sam to the topside do forcing fake other half and they will make him down fake God is gone a solo kill sorry for the jungle I like how you can see Santorum pause there with this is why I knew he was going to give the last Auto over to Viper but I'll take another look at it a Viper doesn't get the sun cuz they got used to the extra speed there but sand Hornets inside route so it doesn't matter he's able to turn him against the wall to get this done and then he get into range the top there but I know that feeling as a jungler or as you get a little bit too Auntie there's no risk and he just use flat iron from what do that was fun but yeah I really liked was when he first came in he actually gave me earlier I'll give a little more space to kill two little minor things actually a difference there since it's when was in range of the Passover Vanderbilt leave now if like was also very good start at 11 CST for Viper who has totes Summoners up has yet to recall though in cash in on the 202 school and Viper really has risen that's why these stars for the else you guys, 45 West North American players making a big big impact on the top Lane playing primarily all these carries Sean Camille now and this is one of the scariest that's very scary as you said if you get ahead early the TM at rush first I am what we talked about in champ select allows you to push that lane and it just makes the enemy jungler life a living hell because Camille can come over the jungle watch for any of the camp at after we destroy you in your own jungle or even make looks towards Midland really want to point out that I purchased before or down when he first he peed and he pushed the wave in the river to staying that he put a trinket or down in the dry brush up there so there's a chance that amazing things that was put sound at think I would get it at that and it might actually start the jungle and get passing look at the bottom side but makes a pass through and they catch a little vision them on the way out in Fort Lee I think the biggest fart About That Bass was this war that they left behind wait a second were you taking some aspects but right here by your red but this is one of the least sacked brush in the entire game which does provide fairly long lasting vision and we'll see if that one does paid some dividends at least it's a good no reward for spending that time going for the cheapest babe I got this money back to the Top by Central actually looking to steal away is red bug has the space for it to report a dead spot trundle if he looped through the bottom Lane jungle and it gives in front of his face you're looking for the show doesn't doesn't need this might have to say grab that gets this deal in a pretty clean I have to leave in the app again trundles far enough away this is a fruity doable dye fake outside what do they do when burned the Eagles to damage across your computer has done but look how taking such a lot of these is not going to Portrait by this permit at all and a very clean Ezekiel the Top Lane yet again for Viper video credits of fibro this time around finishes off the kill for members actually on the map roaming for flyquest they are getting out there for early and make it count alright here's another look at it as we saw the double Rome from a pulled out there and stand for on available may God knows he is going down here there's not a lot he's going to be able to do to outplay that with no support coming from the rest of the team and time so good move from flyquest capitalizing on this pathway power and Camille is Off to the Races now to back up those all in with conqueror so much damage output come through Sheen already you can get it converted a true damage this with a huge butt conquer as well going to come through and she will chase you down individually just spent the money as well as going to feel nice it is gunblade a pecan and as expected here for fake job but it is just a few continually down in money super comes out amazing does infinity War just make sure this has been in but doesn't feel confident enough to gank and feel Flash and Oates up for license I mean Camille is absolutely insanely hard to Fortune
