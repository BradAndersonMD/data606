in-store see if that can throw any sort of a curve ball into the series and do they have anything up his fig leaf plant here for still loaf or is it more of a we're losing we got to try something we got to make something up I hope for flyquest sake that they do have a bit of a plan with so low that isn't just kind of desperation hear these EG has been looking like the stronger team and is in full control and I want to see flight West Cary through toppling over half the games played which is absorbed through a toppling things to know what they find Kilz early level one up there at set set it at that one's down to stay on Rockbridge picks at last time in the early stages of game you know if I predict at Como very low but you was building for this before style of a gameplay and the game wasn't about to go but she was about team fighting so does solo even go for that file a builder to build more for the 585 that's going to be something interesting also worth noting that Greg has now take off the table spent here and has been incredible on this Champion near really really dominant turned it in great game last game I believe you who played in game one so that is going to be something different since he ran obviously has more than just the gragas could look towards something like lease in which is one of his big go to you know as the 4th pick in the draft that gets left up again EG protecting their orange by Banning out trundle this painkiller that can come out from the jungle and we have a very similar draft overall in the first three picks are the same and differences as far as the bands to go and I'm really interested you know if life was his down to run it back does he just go to HBO again and say all right yeah I mean it's really a possibility right so I've been looking at this back to back to the pantheon was band instead of Olaf so you know what couple of small things different as far as that's concerned here looking at the Zoe theft again. The same as last time and they think they're waiting to find pics down at least I like to see what else we afraid of police in indepthly a signature pics for him will Champions what's third I think he's going to maybe go driving you know that the possibility if you just want more AP you could look for something like at least so stacked going to be another tank so this is interesting I do feel like without even the Greg is jungle you would be perhaps more hesitant to go to the Azrael for for this kind of heavy physical damage team assuming all the other picture of the same on the other side cuz it's Jarvis is here and fly the exact same Compass last week right policy will be different juggler for EG but I would be curious to see are they willing to go to Ward's that same pic knowing you don't even have that the magical damage threat coming out of the jungle I'm not sure honestly I never saw the last of the Jungle Sammy., where's the way to find out do they go to this again is a fairly large difference here you do have much less magical damage you know all on the same yes I'd wanted us some Ashley McBride it is just lock it almost mirror dress the only change out of the ten Champions is sincere and scratches himself out for sage want to hear so blacklisted very clearly thinking cough was not an issue it was play we can execute better on this we're bringing in Seoul he may go different field maybe a little more armor heavy or the game even add level-three you can before Gangsta play me you're going to pass going to play around for 6:20 really is kind of farm it to 6 it's it's rare that you're looking for these types of skirmishes early on especially if you don't have a lane dominant melee Championship are alongside it right it's not like you're going to go up there with your said wani Orin combo and looks you knock down this set that's very unlikely to be the type of play if you strip a rally ask for the set yourself or you know something a bit more kind of dominant and maybe you played hours at Renekton is another good example as real not going to be where you're going to live to fight early so I do think since Aaron is going to come and have the job of sitting back and farming up and maybe like I said just hoping that that allows them to dictate the pace of the game better yeah it may well I mean it's going to be listen to watch Forrest is Ronnie is a 55-45 physical damage champion soon right she's not the greatest of course of course right further as well as even if she is 55 physical work prints on their team about tenacity van armor that is debatable the right choice I'm not you know to tell them for sure what they should have been doing butt end of the day I just might still be the match game his profile is even lower the crowd control profile to get higher ed we may still again see the three marked red billed which gives a lot of runaway 250b unmitigated in the damage output it's just so interesting rare that you get to watch back-to-back games from proteins with essentially all these things staying the same your some slight differences I'm not sure that her last game I can't quite recall I want to say that was different a solo is going to be starting during Shield where Viper started during blades a little bit more defensive start there it is just interesting to catch these small changes in small differences to see if that really leads us do anything different or solo himself can just make more of a a big difference now this is two games in a row that ignore has actually done the sweeper start waited till 1:30 then walked into the river directly check for that wart last game I believe he does not find it this game he does so a bit of a pattern there that he'll have to watch out for her because teams that are watching flyquest you know we'll know now this is this is one of his habits and that can be something that can get picked on if you're not careful of course he has the whole like 19 game regular season as well sit to look at but you know what it's like the same Champion even across solo replacing a Viper yeah so I expect I got my words backwards Kubo has to bring flash level one exactly do you know what I think I'm not even sure that he had to flash he was so close to his power is full of hell do you even need to blow the Summoner there I can't see how they have anywhere close to enough damage to actually believe you out after that comes a decision of how much damage will you take not will you die cuz I think there's no way you die it's just a question of do you lose too much help that maybe you lose your teleporter to lose control in the lane so with that watch the very least, does preserve his health in allows himself to to really kind of hang in there in the lane and and not be having give a farm ignore but with a table to kind of fight back a little bit yeah really wish she had the bigger help are there and so we going to get tonight straight on top of the gate c22 9 + Cs and it's not going to get better but this is going to remain a deficit and mrs. Knock up in and when you miss that knock up your kind of felt like feeling a little bit stupid as sent such as punching weight you as you are trying to run back he will be able to pick up some of that farm so he is down just about a little bit over a wave and is going to actually go for the early recall which I find a little bit surprising he's actually going to call and see if he was still fairly high in elf I'm surprised they didn't just crack some items and try to hang around because now if he gets real Yankton and you just how to teleport you're at the risk of actually losing plates of a really falling critically far behind and santorin is up here on this top side so that is a possibility yep put the control work down to fix refillable controller for the controller to the triple brush and of course Splashdown they know he's also a t t down there's no way he gets that potion and is actually in time but so you're seeing Spencer and have to do the due diligence he right he's got to Shadow top and say okay if there is a gank if there is a dive I need to be around for that one and they were going to have to knock a plan for bit of Cece and not go for too much more is you have it's going to come from Como there makes solo use the Haymaker which then pushes the way back towards in your damage but still getting punished very heavily on the back end of that trade I use going to try to clear this out and probably match recalls because he's quite low and doesn't have to pee or so looks still has his tail for Advantage now it just kind of come down to that CPS right in a Solo domestic made his earlier so now you can build a fully reset Legacy for the Damage Done Right Now is there going to be a back and forth in the bottom Lane is 520 this is the way if you want to recall him if your farm is good thing it would have taken one back and the way the Jason for banks he almost has Turtle just barely slink away no summer is left but easy going to have control over the bottom Lane that was so close to a Kill a wonderful and couldn't have stepped past ignore for that final Auto hard to know if he could have got it but that plus the fact that they actually have minion dematerializer means they killed that can't wait so fast that it actually such a critical use of that many dematerialize silly clear off this wave so that wild turtles going to lose everything he's normally would be coming back to the cannon just arriving like now and not really be losing a lot he's going to lose every single year and have the way of pushing away from him so that is such a big deal and that early game ruined really making a big difference As Nice match black Shih Tzu sacroplasty flash going to stay alive down there I and I want to see ya pay call back it get some pick axes to refill a potion he's in a great spot itemized right now and he's really going to do anything as the wave is just now crashing both been there to take their trip back up singer in the tear is on as it should. Kolin as well to vote for the power of evil who's actually already running out of Mana but I do think with the vamps have to rush it's probably going to be just building for that side lengths he doesn't have a very big advantage and I think dinner at that recall but I do think that come over I think he completely wasted as hell for it and has put himself very far behind right away 3 on 3 0-60 ignite have to walk back was there a lot of damage to my night was also burned out of Mana with a blue whale spotting but I need that desperately to fight for having a manifold at all and that's why I think there are two depending on the way over exactly I think they need to try to get some relief up on that topside prior to this potential Harold spawn if they actually want to go for that, does need some healthy is down 20 CS has some to actually pick up there we'll see if he can stabilize has so far so has been looking really good in that one the one bowling Kumo pretty heavily booked top leaders do not have TP don't you be available actually on either side for now and Russillo checking that last night making sure it is safe to move in they are going to be starting up the thrift are all but is spotted at least buy a g but I'm not sure I don't know if I will have to again to be respectful this one since there's a spot that Harold's being attacked not get away in this is Prince at work still affect the blue bus and he gets Rift Herald and he gets first Blood he should have played the entire series but at least he's here now flag with 700 golden The Herald play great but that is actually like that is reportable I have no idea what's been scaring is doing that was a no brain play from since guarantee he's going to die 2 is back in base walking out there like what do you do you know what what are you actually thinking you're going to accomplish there and it just seems crazy that he even walked over and then not only that but he flashes into the wall wasted summer also and that just do it hangs around knowing that they're coming up from River has no mana and Ice to controlling the opponent's he's got so there's like I can't let him get Harold and knock them chopped Erick he will never forgive me for that level one game where he had to burn flash so we got it we just got it we got to show up
