2/3 display and there's really not a lot of time for that the ramp up anymore right like if you could you another slow weekend if it's another load to 111 weekend you're not going it's it's kind of a run that car 9 had it in the previous golf give me all the way to everything going your way very well actually in it Academy so I asked as much as kind of a meme is that is that was actually going to replace the city of the bottom of standing are they have been doing a lot of snow with a variety of strategies did actually tail final game as well as be key has won all but one game a well they'll be a truck I have lost all but one game and they had to be stopped ticking off dick is right above them at 2 and 5 in the standing there not maybe a lot of Hope right now. Kind of hoping to get the Raza that works best forbands make a lot of sense Morgana to release her thick diskin slot into into a funnel as well as a kindred on the table in Torrance going to grab that up for himself very strong Carousel jungler weird contact his thoughts in the game their ability to win any of the Jungle matchups in my Kindred is going to be a pretty exciting or for a fan for an after seeing how well you perform in the closet if you're not a stimulant Carey performance this is another champion that really can I take over the game and if paired up with that galio you have even more ability to get aggressive to be invading and sealing way those camps the only way those bounties not to really scale factordo you pop the lenses fight you time got to go to write time there's a 2-second long Nach up couple hundred damaged by background your way now can you use be met a while ago although standard knock that kind of Gleason in their brackets once again picked up here though I believe clutch not pick up the win when they played their frags try to feed up Kendrick it looks pretty good but I'm going to try his hand at this point. Lame is the thing in some of the other reasons actually being play top one of those recent bus actually gave no additional Auto attack range when you pop your W I wish you really did increase if you play up there in the top line no longer and grabbing a bean or whatever your W Auto Trading can be very powerful so I think the more of that and it is a bit of a flex pack that we haven't seen in a with pipe coming in what are now either looking at a funnel or Morgana mid could be a farming work on them if there are still a lot of options that you're thinking that it is something a bit more atypical hereif you're playing some kind of funnel dragons with your jungle years was definitely looking something a little bit not stand a little Cloud 9 the Broncos picked up here to support matchups do you leave pecan to fix a pipe down at the bottom flexible as that might end up being actually that what we're doing the Collegiate championships for LPS started I was talking with JJ and his coach when it was the flightless Academy coach Denver any for the day J's the best like in Flint of course come in earlier on but they do with the super super good fight so the pick up your extra time for JJs Court thing I mean if it's a more standard look at the cost that you say okay well pipe is the four crackers to the Jungle we're going to his is mid and then you pick a marksman you pick whatever you want for licorice they have a real police scanner, but it definitely could be 5 Morgana bought you know could be sneaky or Jensen playing that you could still be downstairs total Market in mid you know if you're looking at a marksman Metals answer to the galleyare we have seen both working and Lucien be fairly effective in the past in that one the one that can be played by either jump in or sneak it was a lot of flexibility here and because you don't know exactly what to expect where everything is going to go, either which does make it more difficult and dropped a lot of men out the Osco the talents talents what's a pretty famous cell phone alert a couple of times throughout retinol play this weekend it's time for the final couple of pics your Dairy Spanaway Heimer vandeweghe Erie for them to fix you with dr. Mundo that could be coming through waiting to see if that is not yet the band Lucien the hover or not to be going to bot Lane for a while to dilution brownies very very strong bottom Lane can bully almost anything. But if you're ever going to see Braun know your sexy butt hole but this is actually just lose your ground fault line heading down there likely going to be the galio mid. Kindred in the jungle and they are saving their counter picks here forplay games with you. You have to round up their roster looking like Mundo top Lanes but with Darius going to already picking up the table one of the son of the truth really strong matchup into it we have something people playing things like to know are there is more of the extreme counter things like the aura can be very very effective if you want to go that route see what the final tickets going to be here if it is go anymore, damn it if it could be a farming Morgana van Champion as well as it's referred her over his shoulder talk about what the match if you might want to have and we have seen things like beer into galio mid lane before but now every time or standard made sneaky LCS it looks like as a tried-and-true will be locked in for yeah it is going to be the sneaky Morgana bought one of those kind of concerns I have here though for the car in my composition is well you do have very good combos at Kung Fu Fighting you're all magic right in that that doesn't allow your phone as itemized is very very efficiently weather protection Kurzweil they were stacking them are actually in this game I forgo full AP galio your Jarvan props go something like Titanic in to pull them are and you just start to build for efficiencies allow most damage come through from Santoni wildturtle because that is really something that caught nine has open themselves up to know Tru physical damage stores here you can argue Pike but I mean it's not going to be the one to kill a full armor like you know Mr stacky Gallia have a fun time for everyone around here is Darvon was going to pick up in the top playing at the matchup against him lined up on your screen right here Cloud9 vs flyquest of these two coaches shake hands and head off stage is to be a fun one to watch before they probably brought sneaky back into the lot of his very first team is summer split his back onto a sort of additional Mage the Morgana grass for him they think he's Best Inn instead of marching bands against him when I can remember and he's on a major anyway it's pretty funny when you sure yeah I was expecting Marksman is that a really ask him what he's playing and what kind of those hypercane Marksman in Academy but we're going to find out how well he is to be able to perform a certainly you know you're at the gas grill if you need to actually Master Heimer whatever in Opera Opera. 50 is more simple as well as a guy who is a scammer he is a guy who is always been there is grinding games than you expect to have put in the time on a picnic bring it to the gas station with you so we are into this one to take ex or your fuel to us the doors penguin pool at level one so it would be to not be drunk Rim regardless was your lane switch instead of playing the Dallas fashion Crystal Lane be competing Chance The Audience by the way you guys are absolutely amazing once again you can load first class tickets to the chance so we can hear you find them he's contractually obligated to say upon to you that's not true it is that is a false you can ask anyone on the is a liar if you find them asking for a Pun It's it comes with it for the price of the ticket nothing no thanks depends on the man is not me there got to be exactly extemporaneous either way we are playing League of Legends here and minions have met in the mid lane which do you think will die first a blue or red minion put your votes in chat hashtag blue dye hashtag red dye looking like Redman Towing it close thank you by the way I love you all right we are in the midst one flyquest Wendy minion game so far 3 to 2DS doesn't grab stuff the red buffing if you do on his merry way looking for the kid DeMarcus Cousins going to grab Teresa skull crap going to spawn Jerry soup like crab is the crab man I suck at talking it's really annoying Walter to level up at either at level one trying to actually daken aggressively instead of going for the more traditional to you if you can actually get the tag there from bra and you can just get it right up Enmark on his face and Morgana with a pool at level one really has no way to actually trade back and fight you if that fool is already on cool down so Prince what is neat El temporarily a321 Camp lead at Central knocked down bottom skulls and get the mark as that one that was on Jungle can I keep priming their plane obviously a very experienced very successful job in the players and we did not actually see the match of working out is that well for dhokla despite the fact that Acadian did get him quite a head I'm curious to see how this goes for flame vs. licorice can actually make this pic work and having off camera afterwards you know how good of a pic is jarvinen Segundo and this is another opportunity to kind of see if you actually establish and maintain or come in get any follow-up Azazel no top flash anything but doesn't still down flash as a result there and it didn't cost them really anything so just a little bit of time I walked over toward the bush as santorin is already in its going to be rewarded with a Summoner and see how proactive Tanforan is going to be able to be on this Champion again for Mark's really what you're looking for he did get one of the earliest. Also he already has one and this is just a repeat of the earlier game that we had I was actually Lyra tiling the gragas where he was very slow about the early game did next to make any profit plays quite a lot of time so I want to see is fence Gering going to do a better job in the early and is he going to be out there looking for gangs because Greg it does have a very strong couple early levels in very strong blank potential Define is the Middle Lane in the bottle and come to go back to your normal State apartment for Jensen currently always been an amazing landed in ALCS is very first game notwithstanding otherwise got coming in right there and I'm going to be butting heads with Center are they afraid Smyth's turn red and blue pill is it a farm in this Lane right now I got to say this Lucien Brom is bullying so far today they will go back to pay sometimes try to use that time to reset but if you did Kant was based on a few was actually expecting that both to come through and then actually get them either way I've only will be reset to even though can a mini weight Advantage driver side and then throwing up those hopping into the championship run by this Ward liquor so they tried to finger doesn't know or he wants the Bounty really yeah but yeah she kind of zones away and then able to deny this so I believe we are still stuck with only the one bounty on Kidder that is indeed true not going to get number to just yet and we'll see if it comes through currently the Mark is on the scratches and Jarvis uses flag so you can have to pretend City 4th of last year You Can't Fly Away by local what is flame thinking using your flag offensively or even the last hit they saw that Greg this was there they thought he was over by that Scuttle santorin actually watch down and yeah with your flag do you have to pre flash that your only hope you have to disrespect the fact the flash could be coming and you're only way out is actually flashing preemptively Yap either way I miss play there from Flame bike rackets down musician easy kill this is Auntie MattyB's back to Lane so doesn't miss you terribly much but now other attempt out of the Middle Lane of course he's going to be already down the flashing beside the fact that he has plans for the time you can think he was already learned to just as punch to knock him up immediately after that you have a slow coming in from santorin as well that was honestly just a very well-executed gang Concentra and try to get aggressive now trying to take some of this jungle away for slows azelf are not going to be able to join us here for a buff Steel read over to the Marksman the bottom line bar in the jungle pretty much optimal there Microsoft feel pretty decent start over goalie is the Cloud 9 by 301 more time they know he has cleansing know he does not have flash on flash just as much immediately and actually really intelligent because you fly backwards and then the punch this easy is actually got to go off immediately at the start of the kind of shuffle for lack of a better word instead of at the end so good at all and you know Justin is famous for being so so good at that little kind of mini Dodge 2002 e Polson backwards into the sun
