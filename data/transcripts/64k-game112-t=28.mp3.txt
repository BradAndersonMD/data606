substitution of solo had really shaken things up so easy now having lost that last game the biggest I selected they will be on blue side for the day and we'll see if that has any difference here and it is left up is easy willing to actually for a pic that you know is a high enough priority because that's far it's been a lot of set first pickread it has been a lot of that one will see if Elias changes things around of course as well that's awesome right I think that is a A+ there for DG as well keep that has been up as well and I think like us are running out of bands in this series I think they're never going to leave us or the block to Seneca is but I don't give you a priority early-game up on the top side of the response you're going to be a truck so this is a run back I believe from game one for we did see that step vs. aatrox down matchup obviously so low now in therethat does change things up but you know I haven't always been the most effective in the LCS but it does give you pressure up on the top side and it's also if your top laners not your strongest member it's one of those carry salt is going to allow you to kind of go even if and have an impact right they almost never play up around that why they have mono a lot of these cells is that can exceed well on their own and then they can focus on Tuesday they can focus on prep the bot Lane and these types of things do it again so loved here because if he can maintain an even or better laying against solo I think things are going to be looking pretty good for EG and this pic ban memes that they're going to get right they're going to have the ability now if you have been so successful in that first game and also the takeaway of Pantheon makes me wonderremember rise was largely shut down by Santo and having Pantheon and being able to join alongside the atrox for those chemical play with their side it opens up much more of an ability for EG to be the one game that side of a priority and playing through that and that's something that is okay really does excel at so I'm anxious to see if this is kind of tipping their hand so to speak and and indicating hey we want to go to the side lengths we want the Vintage that may be so I wouldn't be surprised to see a rise been over all specially with you know is your job as well you kind of give it would imagine he cares about on Florence a Torrance at 4 and set I mean qq's to me more their loss condition one thing we saw all right if the game is arguably needlessly at level one leaning top cleaner in the LCS the stats back that up there is a difference challenge Wiki and so now to get to the second I think four games in a row a second-round Zoe been away from duke a pic for p16 be at least kind of read it right and I felt like he was healthy enough that he could have actually stayed around and said he'd tee-peed right back into way that was already being questioned so you ended up getting jumped out even more behind the TV back. Logan that have the base without TV and lose Lochte more minutes and out even working me with that band cast into the rise so I think I did have it right I do think EG is going to go for a ride here try to play this island have Google withstand that smashed up early again solo then start to Group San jezu k out on play Four Rise alongside the pantheon from spin but they still have to lock it in for me to be correct so we will find out they need meds they need support so very interesting so it is so great about the side lamp play but now it's about Bali it's actually about crashing towards Botley utilizing the gate for the pantheon from the neighbor Man 3 scene where everything is going to be put you is it going to be set before is it going to be orange support is it going to be you know that both be swapped between jungle in it write a note play champion champion sorry is is Tulia all the time so if there's a delay it expects to be for Corky here at the mattress of Pee Wee is again on a fairly safe backline consistent damage dealer down there I'd like closest it as a do-over a lot of same reasons I like Kalisto with tarek is did you have a hard to access team fight crowd control that you can then throw him into guarantee knock up walk behind them facebreaker if you go for the old as a quick workout you and come back and there's a lot of safety here I can work really really nicely for extra spice it's going to be on the stone on the set which I'm really happy about we got dark Harvest August do not support that I feel like is a little bit questionable I'm going to reserve judgment and see if he can kind of make me feel it feels differently but I just feel like when you are playing support Aftershock is very important for creating the tankiness in the early levels where you don't actually have all of the bonus stats from the additional goal that you would get in a Solo Lane your lower levels and you would be from the filling do are inherently Sheeran and therefore are usually more depending on things like this don't play in the early Aftershock just try to make things happen on me stoneboat can be very useful as far as laning it's also coated now to two more often give you things like Predator when you are basing so you can Predator back out of the map look for Rome's and into those sorts of things so I will be very interesting and as he said of the dark Harvest also pretty cool coming out from the zoo queso I want to see if they can actually find anyting in a with that if they can you stack it up enough that it really makes a difference the upside is basically you get to trigger Aftershock and then get a new Keystone mid fights the keystones mmt do yes that is a downside right is that like well it's conqueror 4 Azazel so we can facebreaker you and deal 25 more damage with it which okay not Darvish butter supposed to be pretty bad dark Harvest of us will help me pretty bad but at level 5 and kill someone also worth noting I was talking of the tendency of ignore these last two games how he was actually sitting in that side brush and at 1:30 he was actually going forward to then sweep out a pixel brush this game easy actually had a three-man play waiting for that time and actually checked for ignoring that side brush but he had already base so already EEG very clear that their coaches were paying attention and notice this kind of thread that I've been pointing at last game tried to make their own level one adjustment do to stop it will my God flashing in level 1 help are dropped off both these guys as well I don't hate burning flash for half of you tell part you think of oceans yes now it means Basil's an easy target free 6lack wife will come back well before he ever get I wonder as old as heck deck Clash this is what the inspiration set of the tree was supposed to do was cool creative rule-breaking I'm in love with what kind of service laning phase II owners in those days ahead Aftershock by the way he's going to be fine through all these tone is undefeated gamer right here Zanesville he is going and what a start from EG this bot Lane showing they are not to be trifled with have been smashing in the two V-22 dookie on the early level 3 ROM the 44th they're all here but it's higher level on ichiba leaders that is level 3 on level three level one on ignore level two on turtle and that makes all the difference in these early level is the Difference Maker 25 by the way sir for something big on this one when the lading face started ignore was sitting at the blubaugh I don't use leasing or what but she was nowhere near the lane is basil and Bangor behind the opposing cast of minions to do when I'm fertile he missed the first email eyes he was zoned out that he missed XP not just gold female is 180 XP in the lane which is absurdly massive for break Point. Lane I don't know what for signor to not being lame to screw drill that hard but that is paying for it after seeing already it could have been him looking for a university for play right where the talk about those early game play maybe he was looking for a different world they've been Place sweep that out and that was part of the game plan but this is terrifying now right you're going up against this Lane and Azazel you know it's going to keep looking for these texts flashes know he has some movement speed on summer usage Rune he's going to be able to jump in there really really quickly and clicked as one of the best snowballing Marksman in the game it is frightening to play against these Lanes from behind so charlatan are going to have to be playing really really safe which means very likely he's going to get full fire Dion these are early dragon and can start running back here they're getting zoned off the wave against 39 CS 216 this is a shellacking in the bottom Lane is a 5 1/2 EGR smurfing down here and it's just absurd house scaring baby going to be biting off more than he can chew put the shield still going to be Sunday here comes the re-engagement flashes to safety and cars at half and not interrupt me to punch come through for 1:40 call him Captain Falcon azelf like was forced to run away again but stay alive or that you're a crucially and and also didn't get any CS right so guess that was a messy fight yes I think Spencer steak out and puts his is Bali in this awkward spot but because they're so much stronger and because turtle is having a focused on fighting the Champions not the minion he's not getting any Farm throughout this and meanwhile up in the Top Lane yeah SOLO you're doing great you have an advantage here but you're playing aatrox into the orange orange can stabilize and be in a position with levels where you can safely Wayfair at your turd almost forever so you really don't even care about that side of the mat easier just going to leave come on that island and say great farming up bud and we'll be down here on the bottom side looking for poor man plays and playing around or Calista who is super fit felt right now looking at is Kubo clean press the wave and so it takes his first recall of the game it's going to be about a 14c Isley top side as the lanes reset to stay around and waving with you at first items coming through but, he's going to frisbee 57 minutes in at levels at level seven his potions get his control board and see right now the brake is alive and then Harold spawns in about 40 seconds turtle and ignore level three and four to five and five four three plates taken down and we'll be Seymour down here the points the dress itself going to drop here comes the wall and I got to stop off and gets back away just really to stay alive what's an 8-minute first person 3 kills GG time to go next Boise G pollinating this game they are running over the bot Lane holy moly they are just crushing flyquest
