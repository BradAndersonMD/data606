thank you very much Dash and ryzen 1400 chance to see is Silas in this will be dropped off the face of the rift for the fifth game today flash wolves 1 and 2 there School win against wrongful Buffalo do you do Esports looking like a top-tier team in this room it over to take care of business against black lives here and it looks like they're going with the rides with Echo Polly and Silas Bowl still available fix will be locked in for I quickly I want to make note that this was Raisa left open in a game with di2 I buy in the creative and also it being Absolute Comfort for Wonder and caps I think you have to take it first picked even though it hasn't been rated first pick in many dropsI went to see now with him to come out along to this one typically teams will wait a very long time to show their second solo Lanes at wonder and Taps both have equal opportunity to play a quick pick up here now for a more aggressive play foursome engage we're going to probably look at follow-up team fight then out of this one yeah and if you're facing the team fight they already have the Tom kench on the side of D2 so there a lot of options with the abyss The Voyage moving around the map for later and see if black Willows answer it with a little bit of semi Global themselves and more followed so this is the bog standard let's dive in a backline locked in the cage follow up with the NACA end of the tan and try to kill some back liners 80 karrie bands you would imagine going towards something a bit different in the bot Lane that was the Nika on the date of time is going to be so much moreyou want me to stop and I'll previous series and we'll see how many but link has been taken out and put on display in the last game The Tom kench and Azrael required zero jungle attention of the entire game extremely safe and that allows you to put so much into the solo Lane that have been so strong for G2 in setting up multiple rooms in setting up their control of the map for the mid game might be taking up some of that help and getting a soul in his head taken off the table he roll-off dropped off we know if there's still one more time for me to grab for fossils one more for G2 as well and fossil can finally answer a little bit when that finally comes through is a couple of marching bands of course caixa in Calista off the table and not waiting what the final Flat Shoals band will be what will pick up a dropped off the echo stick that comment you made about the Edge of Time can smell meaning resourcesmaybe the contest would respond rather than just going for a topside jungler like for example the Leafs in the latest Indo will be the event there is always concerned with you end up with three laners jungler and Cousteau Lane is it to 14522 composition hear Rihanna ball on top of the jar been jumping with the galio on his back now that is a huge Wombo Combo I believe it looks like a team fight comp sings be what you wanted to hear an aggressive bottom Lane is going to be what they want something that in the right person maybe you can force a kill Sarah would have been fueling on the farming side now the answer isa lot of options Food Lion to Silas in either mid or Top Gear only have full information where the matchups that I can definitely bring him back through the Ariana trade damage in the mid they make oh oh so flexible on the G2 side will be the final luck exactly what they think is better but Nico and Silas is here as real I think 99.9 percentage of first place are the salon and I will see who they want to fight against better rise top orianna mid and looks like it's Nico about of the rise and Silas about it Ariana Grande where do you want to try to take down the right I think you have to go aggressive on Rise to make this matchup works we expecting on hit build coming in from all you can be to try to push but on head is the one that really kind of sticks The Landing over the course of the early to mid game transition to variance to see once we hit the game the room Choice coming through from Hannah and that Dooby Doo on the top sidedefinitely a go the way of the Jarvan and Rise room prison into Jarvan knock up could turn that entire game plan right back around on them so tracking the enemy jungler is going to be of the utmost importance in this game a long as you land the room prison even if she does turn invisible tonight. Still almost certainly will like we just saw in the previous game flaps on the back foot you get they have never ever missed the top for MSI across all the years they have gone this would be the first they missed looking to pick up a win against GGG 2 who has been impressive so far has been a great pride of Europe here at this tournament and Nikki X seems to be able to keep playing with the roster letssingit in the gamewe are on to the rift here for game number 5 flash Wolves at 1 and 2 G2 at two in one Invictus gaming round-robin lots of game still here to play North be disappointed with the first three or four games results there is lots of still do and prove and improve upon G2 certainly looking Fierce come so far in this tournament and caps on Silas was just on display earlier today versus Team Liquid with a little bit of attention from Yang Coast he was able to demolish the team later on and be to have a comp that would really fit them even if it was the same teacher lineup at Worlds 2018 this is the quintessential131, coming from 3 to Wireless at Actos side length as the game goes on at the moment you see galio jarvinen Ariana like freak so silly put it's a team fight come through and through on the side of flash feel like you're saying though G2 drafting so many answers for that type of constant composition perks on Ezreal with Mickey Exxon Tom kenshiro the abyss avoid being able to lend and more threats to a 1-3-1 style of play and then yank goes having the kickback year on lease in is a huge disengage little thing that happened right there is rather walk down to the war that was a veal to leech experience for that Ward kill this tells me normally down the toll Lane get the kill the entire first wave plus something else to get level 2 instead if you share an award XP it's just the first wave we knew cats. XP himself on a single Ward though it's going to be level two bit early but shouldn't mean too much because look at the same XP caps went down for a late Lord also to try tothank God for this jungle pathing sell a different agencies going on there is that level two already as you mentioned break in the bus lane right now perks and Mickey happy to give up the push to fly just getting some Farm another to write his first acts up his manaflow band and the wait to see what else comes in here I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by Jeff Howell Nikki extant words are playing at gotten two or three Duo kills in Lane just across the street they've been actually dominant as a do I would say overall and we knew they were good but you actually stuff up so well have been impressed I will say we're going to track these jugglers early on and boujee on the job and has gone to Red Bluff straight to topside if you get that room prison in prison and knocked up and this clone go out for one or an hourly rate for bougie was the big moment that I put down by cops at level on didn't spot him but now yank us is lying and white as more man I can do some damage here but going to try to flagcan help him heal back up when he backs away this is so big for G2 they took a very very terrible opening to the game getting destroyed here as we talked about in shape as long as you have the point-and-click room prison and makes Jarvis job so easy you guarantee that combo they get the early kill them anyway still pushing in his favour but gancos doesn't let it at that lies in wait at the fellowcraft he sets up and kill 4 cap and once again this is capsulas with early money I want I want the fewest to appreciate is not just the early money being sent it on to the oh so scary Silent from caps think about what was gained in those Gangsta kill topside first but go but no flash is used by Wonder but then the red front coming intiming coming in for the silence as well the phone is subjective go the way of seats so we can definitely talk up what class was got out of it in it that early fear for ride a Nabi is the guy that they want really money on to write to backup your points and obvious been one that is not more resources in Mora flash wolves Focus since the changes to the team so he's the one that they should be focusing on and ride can be an answer in that side lane even if they have to do with the butt Shack San Diego's fine since second successful gienchi every time we come up with a story here for Flash wolves janko's answers it again the leasing is on fire extremely active in the early game and helping out those solos as expectedking of the jungle artist Lee that's the more ideal situation him setting up the kills for his solo laners and then catching in we get ice will freeze frame there of recent down Jarvis the moment right before the gym flag of the wall into the Q follow and we all saw that one play out to look at this G2 800 gold ahead and I think of unfortunate that the kills were given 2019 MSI colorized Sox earlier in the broadcast right now Sky Highonce again 500 gold leave for G2 Esports can you sing the wits and being rushed very early Wonder had the components right now already is it even harder be knocked down by this rise as you got the durability to handle most this one's going to get that one just yet but overall the favorites not looking very good in this tournament it should be noted that one that has much more flexibility than the rice and needs to build his peers and work into the seraphs Embrace and from there because of that one that can attack both so Alliance by building a with then the second up that magic resist and they will be enough to force rise under attack early recalls to try to kontest with an echo in the sidelines of enough to silent but we should note has gone conqueror 4 extended brawls then he may be able to answer the rise usually impervious in the side light here we go there going to focus on the top side caps is level 6 on the sides but Yanko sits on award supplies wolves know that this is comingGianna be coming right back in if you see is the least then drop off the word that you have pretty trademark G2 Play Right Thurr caps getting the push broom outside trying to find one of his wings to put a head so quickly it has been Wonder exactly whenever SKT with all the pressure they gave wonders Jason similar brains out of hackers are putting pressure on right now in his Lane going very well at 5236 PSI is the me one of the funnier jokes that Tyler is it still a maybe you get the Oriana ultimate you can go to a sombrero but you don't get to move it around much so it's it's mostly for those all in trying to get the extra full back there and I want people to know it was really nothing purchased on the back it was a false back on the Ariana wants to wait till 6 minutes teleport back in and then laying a gentle spps backup nothing doing their winter up awkwardly on that back I'll talk a bit late at all if you wanted to burn anybody or to cool down to Cape the trade came back and is it an escape to try to Auto Tech couldn't quite get it there and he's not in time to get through the re calling youthen whatever no harm no foul but it's 1500 Goldwing G2 ahead if they gotten Farm in a lot of places right now and now round 2 in the bottom line is Betty take a couple of shots for Cerritos still doing pretty well in this Lane up again solution up in form mean while keeping track of these jugglers yank us is actually not making his way down to the bottom side and he is level 6 with access to the dragon kick and he continues going for these invade on the flash wolves Red Bluff started up by himself and Brooke is going to trade I'll sing into the trade like you mentioned a Level under no completed send a whole both teams had Vision around the area at the sea fishing but not of course spotting the word that song Come interestyou got knocked the Warhammer right now going to go for the quick Mountain Drake 8 minutes and change in this will be helpful in the mid-to-late game and going to plow down some cigarettes as well on tests and eventually. We'll go over cleanly rather grass is blue so far everything was fine I do really enjoy watching you know successful uses of Champions likely sin in the early games you guys get a lot of the power of the champion in actual just straight-up one-v-one Julie was taken out and so much of it is about the information in the mobility that you have two choices that you make with it that you know these advantages that you've gone for the team have been with smart choices no setting up the brush pink there by the Scuttle crab you don't forget the first one the first kill for
