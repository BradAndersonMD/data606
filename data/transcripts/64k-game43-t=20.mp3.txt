bites unless I'm really excited actually see the draft coming in the game 3 year we saw Team Liquid go for this sort of dive comp in Kingdom blunt they went back to go to the tried-and-true front to back to you fight style in game ever they dominated black West was the one trying to dive and attack into that game so now I wonder what they were dozens will be here in game 3 they are on the blue side Shen getting banned out so that is going to be a first in the scariest thing I've traded this back and forth but Team Liquid with a constant attack toward santorin in pickup bed is in Banning out this Lilia and Eve by consistently Warren has been no really really one of the best junglers in the league and he has a very big champion pool in a 1/6 for the first time last name is Love For the First Time all series as a result now it is a champion we have seen at what out of town all summer long it's Roxas most play if they are concerned about the championfirst take on a flight quest in a Champion Auto V Sentra has not shown us a lot I'll be so yes Caitlin is free both cake here but it also is a TL can add a third Jungle Band and honestly I don't think I've liked was is going to be worried about the Lisa and I know the frocks is is an incredible lease in player but if you'd like what is going to play the super slow style I don't think that you have to worry so much about police and it's not as stealing monster is a playmaker but I'm not really the pic I think that they are most concerned about now because of the scaling the farming ability we are not going to have the ass coming through it is the gym which I do think can answer the Caitlin some people is kind of talked about it as it as a Caitlyn counter I don't believe it to be that you know I've watched quite a few Pro matches now with this matchup and I definitely believe unless there is a severe support mismatched the best of the Gin is hoping to do is get push against the Caitlin because of gin does have fairly good waythere is going to come and we'll see down to can you actually sidestep to build over peacemakers can you avoid those and just try to keep this Lane in equilibrium all right well even though Jen has been picking up in 30 especially in the LPL actually crossed those League's top forties how did I get to win rate so far with Caitlin steak in a 55 and fro play that can be of course. But still want to bring up to your ass like when he's around out there first three up with a band phase comes through they were going to answer could be going to go ahead and say that I think Morgana movie fantastic here now helps to get you the push as well as the support of any sort team who could have a winning bought Lane to be two again I do think is important for dinner play from Ed Gein of course with the xq damage known that for a shot you want to be snowballing you want to be pushing the pace of having that additional gold did does traditionally really struggle with killing tanks so if like West Coast volibear plus something like Warren I do think the TL is going to need someone to really help to do that deal deal damage to front line mordekaiser can do that some what is not really the best Tank Killer and it seems like generally speaking but I just pretended health HP damaged obviously with the passive plus you're in beef building until the injuries which is really going to help the burn through any HP that the bulb Baron attention or something like that would be stacking my annual fee how much they could do against the front line there was a mordecai to comes in the Orange's Banda right away get rid of the wrong tanks are banned as well they have increasingly early on in these rest and then have gone ahead and I will be back to do band away but it feels like that's going to be likely on their side and we need a mid and support on the TL side we need mid and top on Aflac Westside they cannot guarantee how to fix both roles we know if Worthen countertop side but I don't think that's a good movie that's like what answer though you can go towards that beat them or Kaiser when is blind such as the Jacks but I think I'm more likely to be the GPS actually like to see TL fan that out is comfortable playing into the mordekaiser and it's also a good matchup in the Border Kaiser I'll Renekton is another one that no does have a pretty strong answer to that Mort in the 1D one but to me this is just like we should go GP go heavy damage mid laner that they're going to be normally going forward like he is here or the Oriana or the Cassiopeia depending on what they want to play and I think I'll put them in a really really good situation at the border guys are blind did feel a little bit weird to me because I think you're losing out on the potential of getting that Morgana early clearly they may be wanted some more guaranteed engage maybe they were never going to go to that Mordecai that Morgana anyway Zyra is something I've been wanting to see perseid it is it's such a good lading Champion you really can dominate in the to be to the amount of Pope you have to push you have with your cutest even on the Range been in similar to Karma can be incredibly powerful but you are very susceptible to his gang so you have to be protected on that bottom side with this heavy push Zyra also functions welding team fights against mail a Pantheon new shipments like father and thrash that are going to have to be walking through your altered plants that is very difficult for them to be able to do that being said if you can land a hook on them it's going to work rate like what's going with what was my expected tax you know as a sad is Jerry quarry on a GP I think this makes a lot of sense for them they are looking front-to-back Team Liquid they are fairly AP heavy right now I do feel I think we're probably still going to get magic damage-dealing mid laner muchin middle Zone almost let me know how to attack, it is a peacock is a very very very very good pic into his ear he simply cannot close the gap on you he doesn't walk very fast do you land a folk from forever way and to be clear flyquest engaged to Schriever Shuffle and otherwise everything is outside of a ranch outside of those ranges so this is a fairy poke heavy Zyra is well to play around Jensen and tactical down to the bottom side it's it's such an interesting composition write it and again I think that it can match up well we just have to seek ntl play this difference South because this is the second time now in the series they've really departed from their kind of standard lots of tanks and back by damage and just front to back this is much more of a poke style of gameplay where you're going to be throwing down the general 380 Spokane Caguas is poking Non-Stop and you're just trying to kind of overwhelming importance of lice kill shot that they have to die if you miss position at all on a comp like this is incredibly Chief gets swept in by the aesir get hit by hook or anything like that things can go bad quickly so I'm excited to see how TL really does manages, because I do think these are some pics we should be seeing more of the ALCS I'm going to be really excited if they can really pay dividends for them it's going to be really interesting Team Liquid add two more unique Champions to their pool the first kog'maw game of the split for Jensen the first gen game of the split here for Rookie of the Year in tactical that's going to be exciting to me it's one of the things that we gave to your criticism for was very very shallow Champion pools not from his whole lot of difference that said even with a constraint pool is enough to take first place in regular-season best record ever had their Po-Boys to maybe do the same thing here in playoffs was there run there as well that they add more to the pool at the upper bracket final just saying hey there's more threats to care about boarding students to consider Banning as they're up against their toughest competition gas and black was looking for a sneaky little one year and saira off and goes to Lane to get seeds down in the lane to set up the push and because of this if they can actually sneak around here for JJ could Dive Level One okay book from the brush is not good enough nice try but he decides if the whole time around if that lands for is pretty much always dead end of the day to get nothing not going to be able to find it I like the attempt though that is 100% of Justin based on his Ira because if you want to get push on his Ira you utilize your pasta to stand in the area and get those seeds to spawn you can do this for a good lease but in this case you know you walked Elaine you allow always seed to spawn and then your parts kit kat tattoo level one because you were dropped on the q's bumblebees plants okay if I didn't do that so that's what they were anticipating and that's what they were trying to counteract at the very least like was denied cordage a from being able to put down those plants in the bottom Lane so they're not going to have as guaranteed of a bush do it do still expect chiroplus gin to maintain that pushed in the early game and we'll have to see how flyquest can hold up here because there is a potential to all in but we have to kind of watch how proficient or JJ is on the stick because once it in Iraq that's really interesting about the Zara and one of the reasons that I think is it supposed to be a great match up into thresh is that if you are quick you can place at a plant in front of yourself and then immediately key for the instant spawn a plant that can take the thresh hook pretty much every single time as long as you hold onto a c and you're really fast you never pressed and you know it and you leave a second wc2 valable at all times you can eat W to block that hook as long as you pay attention to think what you said different words and we are on to the next Lane is he fits the cute down sponsor more plants because he's going to overdraw planted it got to take some very much but it's 30 gold that is some combat damage is feeling good probably going to be playing manaflow band I do expect you want to be stacking that up early as well will be interesting to see where he wants to go there are some different options as far as the styropek does go you do have to know to like when comparing two locks for a higher level of the way higher risk because it didn't really Shield this isn't Guardian know it's spell piece so no HP and no resolve to really going to keep you safe in that he is going as well for Domination secondary so he doesn't even have no gold plating or anything along those lines yep. But there's a possible to go back up yet quote for his primary and I hope he's getting movement speed on exhausted flashed when I get him away from being dosed is the primary target the easiest Target I would say on this t l comp overall I will see if they can kind of push him down or if you can keep the cat's going using landform broxah not going to fight Center it if it's not going to be a contest like if it has spells available he just dropped on his head and you've go into that you take the damage the shielding and his extended damage and self-healing does go, very we cleaner free 6 but post sick with the emacs you can pretty much it is to kill the backline very easily with Yuri plus one charge of that ultimate your way up there becomes very very strong and you know it's really level six and then honestly even that the later ranks of the ultimate workhog much does start to get an advantage because you are getting the longer and longer range on your ultimate and that's really where I got the power from the champion, we could have sold the top slide makes himself land of barrel chained Rock Atlantic you call now 28cf on US1 Jensen to go to the harsh of Maxi is you expect on a peacock shut the wave down no big problem here I can see is he recalling a deed was he was Guy okay he's gone no big deal where to get that reset coming through is again finished codex comes through, people once again for his range match up watch the way there. They might be able to chase him down but what's a girl team is for a cat is dead Lilo and got to be killing solo can't get more than single count back any base the counter take paroxetine with two but he does have CC and a wave is is looking pretty okay friend so we should be able to CP back and actually fix the way from celso infant likely still will lose more this was incredibly close though this does show just how to take keyboard Kaiser came yet grasped Rock Comes the Sun comes up for these don't quite have enough damage in Concord get stacked against the Safeguard his healing starts to come through in the first kill does arrive trial field coming across all so and solo just barely finishing them off with that final shoe as he went down that was so critical cuz he dies there and then that survived they fully reset the wave and he was as so much more instead they both got to kill he has a wave in his favor because he saw it until 4 and as a result is up a lot of farm 3 gold and a 3-second cool down your refund is the plant comes right it was faced it wasn't necessarily as a hook block better money from South landing and move back out of this game is Team Liquid are Up 3 to 200 gold from laying face I'll just have to kill being the primary part of that one is toplands up in farm and sent or in the same but hey kills a nice as well don't say terrific first is trying to put out the DL bottom line then he wants me for the schedule and sent you the tracking but he's trying to make sure that is gin darling could not actually push up in and interfere with take with, going back to face this will not be so goddamn it I wouldn't be a First Bank account until about 10 minutes Health Ade grabbed up an impact the Knights Play here's is hey you know what I do my timers you did a blue start blubaugh is going to be mine now you're doing Drake very very had left over that went over the wave
