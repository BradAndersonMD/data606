this game now as well as fixed in bands have begun Rumble darvina Cowley fan. All right let's see if we get any Soraka shenanigan in this game as well I would say it's it's probably should show up I know people have been throwing around possible counters to it today when I want them let it through and lose to it you can pick stuff to try and kill it and laying around those types of things for a full-bird Alexa or course the van here and if TLS play a Carrie 80s like I think it's I think it's fine I don't think he's like yeah she's fine but it but yeah it's not it's not quite the sameall right well they respond with the lesion van of their own and are you goes you get your diabetic a way we think I already told us he's not going to be out and I think that I would be a lot right now to overlook because one of the best players in the league like you could just do more than Douglas and almost any game State vote as as players in Champions combine that's to be really awesome here I think it's the last chance we come over you're not very good at the game Feed themselves should look pretty nice here I also why God I like the second round red skies picking your mid laner and then throwing up right after this goes you'll get first shot at it and then you get the band out counters afterwards but did you switch it up go for the Gangplank into the atrox want to unpack favorites. Got this many time and it also lends itself fluoride staining your ultimate quartz double and core JJ Williams Oxford Skin Clinic in the split for if you know Stephen very very well but Sunday is all about physical damage melee aggressive Fighters those third aatrox game now in 5 bring up to the toppling there for Sunday at the bands coming through from the jungle straight up and throw their weight about Royals playing that Miss still think he has jungle is really scariest mid-layer to play again because that is 100% of 0 if they have you know with the water blade guarantees Ruess projects with a flat screen TV as well so I can definitely not wanting to get snowball. So far that's so much stuff has been one of the weak points out skin liquid that he has to be going to a lane farming do y'all need a minute later and I can't be blind the block I think I would pick jungle here first those days your dick until you see everything from hundred thieves no reason to show your hand first thing you do free well done looking at we've been here for sure and fire possible early game moves but setting up with a lot of pick and play more of a split map in 200 thieves that usually will like to play 5-person Cottages just one that matches last game repeat up with TL wants to play themselves they would work pretty okay here's enough damn it. It's he's now need to support pick up what's wrong band away but left up could be Leona kabiling aggressive who will we have some very strong right now but well I fell into the time change lanes. I think it is a good last big bore son when you do have to Oriana we saw her last game then to match up here you can have the upper hand at level four first but jungler interaction means so much last game against ground hovering topside get games early dies in The matchups and also dies topside when he tried to go for the ones you wanted which is DJ so there's no easy out playroom there for the Oriana plus he play always does come into it but certainly all right I'll take a look at this one as a lioness are complete he must have got counter picks in Top Lane and Midland shrimps are on a ruler in the Leafs in for him TL like in my mind should look good on the top side as long as burn fire can kind of shake off of page Turners and play Wild Squad and I'm also looking at media because meteos is a player that has been map of LCS yeah really. Right there he's always been a cop after I go he said a rough start to this split but in this particular game 2 has a couple of options are there opportunities to go for game play game early on a chocolate and put the Gangplank in trying to get control of the Midway was you use to get up there you can actually try to push it back that's very difficult to do in fact is really good at taking toppling pressure away from the rest of mass of for JJ far point of the missing jungler that's the reason we're still great or even themselves up here cuz hundred thieves I feel very harmonious cat yeah I think those to work really well together you know I love how respectful our fans are till I can let the other half like get there half the fan to appreciate you what I want to say thank you very much synchronize chance coming through synchronize Riverdance as well the river King chords JJ gets priority though the nearest place his word yet he did so not going to completely really recall then sometimes you see ya you get your free drink at Ward then go back for the sweeper keeps canceling it though so I won't be the case this time I think it's going to hold on to it and have topside starts all right and say no crazy Shenanigans beginning this game I didn't look back to their assigned lanes and mediums will be if he wants to be on before the camps spawn but looks like that isn't on the way ping the Gangplank going to invade the blue box and say hey to do in that he is not it's going to be a wolf start with me just allowed to be to be safe there as far as the fro junglers right now has one of the weakest early start so often times in professional games will see teams that have gragas if the opposing team has any sort of level 1 logo for level 1 invade try to push him off his butt so I guess where is often times do you have to start these very small we can't beat us does that safely but if I was going to find him on the bus Anyway come to your level 2 with red and there's a 0% chance that you can finally send with Red Bluff there as Braga Sylvia's going to have to give up Priority in the jungle as is very customary for garden players and let us play on The Shield is down here comes in speak nicely done stops the counter jungle could go for a gank and I should know he can see him I think writing that that's a son that's a cute that is a lot of damage and the Flash and be careful truck show Amigos in champ select because he has had a rough start is on fire in this game he did not have to fight the red plastic piece in level 2 for him he let them do the work it's Carter Creek beaten by police in level 2 he just let him do the work on the blue pits feels that away finds him with Akil here teamwork and stunt Thrones up from the river run by the way like incredible and there are so many things in this replay because every time you show yourself on an early game as a jungler you can't just turn your brain off and then go back in Europe your own jungle like at the stage space because it's your jungle your side of the map voice out of Safe space reach there all the time to reclaim and a talent stunt is going to lead the charge on that one that was an awesome play we re Clement hashtag it could be positive this year that was beautiful so now he's pushing forward nice for the damage out there from Sunday as well as fact. all right everybody take a deep breath is a very significant lead I would say because it's this early in the game and in the way that has occurred start now go for another play just get the Comcast not a lot of Crockett roll the flavor to be there in just barely walks away that was not leave a trace back that hard and that is a flash down and the heel down to the bottom line is he's still looking to fire away video very active now that is that is difficult to to call when I get a flash on that play and pack holds it Sunday the same all right like I said there's a lot of opportunity for this gragas around the map videos make his presence felt bottom side versus AJ could have forced Team Liquid play a little bit more defensively down there someday doing his own work burning stomach has felt on the top half and building a big minion way the abyss meaning wave should get picked up by Impacto because meet us just shows bottom side and then he went back to the Jungle. Impact field very thankful that there is not a krakus here upon arrival from that teleport to fight him on that big minion wave that was stacked up and he'll be able to clean that up it will result in a six yes leave for impact by the way. Hook good spice to buy cherne calcite in the river 3 verses to fix you. combining on so many plays in this game Cody Sun also had grabbed it to Von evelio so they're able to get the days down Dragon will be acquired off of that River play a stunt and bloodthirsty Juke and Dublin had the Mind Games going it's away all right here's another play Sun going for the opening goes like this Pinos is here and they have a fellas coming up Vicky different bear Cody Sun Walk This Way up to the fight double with his farm in the mini way down on the bottom of your mini-map that you can see and you do with the last 4 words that got him with his hip up to play to secure that one and they chased down the Tomcats chill as well it's also result I'm in heading right back to laying here pushing it up once again very good early game right now per hundred thousand gold is certainly Within Reach for Team Liquid side fancy stay safe if the top seven African incredibly well impact of town who fixes up XI vs he's got that she's done all ready to fight this venues good dancer someday but in fact I pushed off the way the oranges cuties to get the grass tells back up but he's acting winning this race yeah after you use all your cues there on a fox a man has to back off from the trade impact able to start jogging on Crafting potion he's got biscuits upon arrival that's basically our game plan for the Gangplank in this matchup you sustained through it you farm up for the early stages and now that he's got his seen you can actually trade back a lot more effectively bigger Bruce Lee call Lee sit up there too often will call their jugglers and make them waste time if they can make anything out of this yeah I mean Sunday also has flash so many waves in a bad spot for someday though he really wants you to crash it videos right now on the Wolves going to sit there and finish the campout was sick of work Services good enough that he's not too terribly afraid nice might get around the barrel turns it around doesn't get the Q Damage Done to him and I video is heading towards the top side I will probably come by Lisa in Grandma's for Destruction as well as media is going to walk to division if it's got to just find out so not seeing where's it gone as well
