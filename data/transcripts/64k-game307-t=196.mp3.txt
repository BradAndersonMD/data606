Azazel has to be at the back of the month at least of the Cloud 9 80 Karat and let's see what comes through for swirl the girls have first pick here they chose blue side and the bands coming through vents Durant staying in the lineup they removing some of those high damage range gun glue from the behind back side to Leah Kindred both o&o flaming fish out who have to be shifted around because of counterfeit Jensen can guarantee and sells the best possible matchup R&G I want to see what they had to get rid of to ensure that's too bad I like that the respect to what was the skin pick both are goats and eight parts of both available and would imagine the Angie Willis in Split six. Once again just like they did last time and say you know what you don't have your same kind of it this time around Alex Ulrich on everything still available right now if R&G once again take desire phone fixes that. I know I'm there for to try and split up the loudest you or feel like it is a blue slide drop on a patchyou know right side has been stepping up now of course not in a very big mlxg MSI but has it now here in the decider for the first speed out of the group. It's going to be incredibly scary teams was other parts of the bracket C9 weather going to look for Here original arrival into the LPL when he started surprising table was picking strange Champions I've been doing strange things you know nothing he doesn't take before level 6 why is it die down in my bottom line is I over-extended back the bomb 265 South underestimate the fact that he will still play a very aggressively game the Cloud 9 what are they going to look for here at the dedicated jungler and leaves in our Graves and will it be that work on later on does that gets going away by R&D lots of questions to answer in this draft as time ticks down and no they will look for thrash for or the planning for ways to save against the not so I think that's why aren't you liked it upbest thing listen to put way more priority on getting his Ira Khan bought me because if you don't then we're just going to steal one of the components away from you all were going to pick fraction to an already shown that we can play it so timeline events going to the next level of thinking thing where you know what if we take the trash out the fourth what have you got left Shane is taking away our house if they can wait till I'm 10 she's taken away wait till we can get a really strong TV to guarantee this is a zone that is still up and available we have seen it throughout the tournament as the answer to this maybe they just play omage to these eliminated lck team picked himself out something up like a range support Prime bully d'Alene I think that they still options down that in this position and of course they get the chance to drive a truck so is the hacker and snap call is it that's the big question for me and I will say the wall I do like the pic when it's an electrician hands Cloud 9 Zip drive to 131 stop earlier and was able to play towards back spring so if they do you want to go for it again I hope that they go morphewhy angles that seems to be more of that strength so far in the second round of this group I have a great team fight and argue be much better one than this Lucinda they're going to go ahead and quickly take off this building and now he's mine atrox is flexible we've seen plenty of a truck mid here and I'm still waiting for Lucian mid to come out I feel like I could be the match if it has a lien in particular but we'll wait to see of course I don't have any pot Lane band the Midland band instead of Jensen more or less lines of billions I wonder how far they attacked Dow who is Champion cool because while Snapchatting can be created in the only game you don't expect him to go towards the midline I would expect that they could be a 131 come coming out of our energy while solution doesn't lend itself towards that they do have the ability now to drag Gillian into a sign language Billy and does not want to be able to do so I think it's ever a lot of options open R&G on the flip side I think cloud 9 just must stick with a tampon in the death ball the ability to get everyone on the same page and then counter-attack brilliantly as we same throughout today's play keeping my eyes on how I do you round this out as well because it looks like to take out do they have you already have the zillion and the mid they could do the little bit more engage in that composition right now cuz outside of the stress you don't really have that many ways to start a fight I like the Synergy between a zillion I think it does give you some early play make a potential to enable you to play through your fault line we're likely here maybe even the Scion as well but a dedicated tank top laner I think does make sense lead the 131 kind of character and I know you can probably defend mid lane by SIA through difficulties I do expect a tank to play hard and Gage Blue Diamond in the Back line but we'll see if aren't you can carry the load and there is that work on picked up the right at the bottom line of RNG and now they just waiting on child who is picking does he go to look something like a cinder in trying once again shall be in the lane early start trying to pressure not all that great in civilian as the game progresses just because of the revive hatchets but we still free up some aggression down into this bottom line that's the one of the go Paisa and move Evolution around will see 3 seconds ago no syndra is going to be the graph most likely time goes through it will be loosed York on bottom and Sandra and MIT single-target single member it's very easy for a zillion to say well you know what I'm just going to save the tax to revive him and now the singer loses its value and he fights so I feel like I was mainly doing it for Lanes Frank it isn't really compliment the 131 but it will allow roll never give up to have that priority in mid in cough and potentially be known as Angel Beats in the Chinese solar que le blanc's syndra his two most played Champions with a monster on that this is arguably one of the most important games played at world so far it's R&G get out of first see they can guarantee that they will have an easy a run at the bracket State whilst you could still out who they are the best well you want to make it as easy as possible for yourself if you lose he told him it gets the stately harder so if we just think about what it means on a global scale be knocked out of proceed by cloud nine the North American represented when you consider how strong are and you will consider coming in my mind could you so much in terms of their reputation and making a strong run into the world championship this could be such a huge deal for them if they find that up there I don't think I could ever come out of the worlds group stage with a number one seed out of a group this would be a bit historic here and it was also I was a threat to get first see that's an RNG second but that's a lot of hemming and hawing through later on here it is now it's time for the players on the the coaches have shook hands and the fight for the top spot in the group of death is on the line we know vitality and Genji have already fallen in third in prospectively question is can Cloud Nine top of group that contains the MSI Champion orders RNG go exactly where they do at the end of it all the beginning of it all and take this first spot we are ready to go on the rest ladies and gentlemen Royal never give off and Cloud 9 to do battle and I do want to hit on the coach of saying I'm just for a second because made his career in the lck transfer to the LPL and became the king of the region with PDG winning MSI Nel transforms a rookie C9 lineup into the potential number one seed from the group of death so much praise has to go to Worlds rated he has given his team a very similar drop and now it is on the players to execute I'm really excited for this game we see Jensen with the zillion pick once again won't have a huge amount of pressure in the early laning phase very much what you expect but it is a huge pics. C9 and how they like to pray cuz you so much by potential speeding up that has been jar allowing him to dive on two families like the cinder in these jeans by giving him that Revival option I mean 69 can be very dangerous in these fights at that is still a whiles away and when you are a zillion facing off against this Sandra in the Midland early-game threat is going to be on the side of Sandra Spence Karen has played most of these games this year with goldenglue Jensen has been playing a lot with lava this is the Jensen blabber style of aggressive jungle we have to see where that's any points because that mid-length at least until Level 6 is heavily R&G Paving so you're not going to push the wave in early at all just a few bottles now they start with it as they see who is Ian Ben Geren where start it isn't enough all ready for this evening to do this one far above-average bike if he goes to that Black Cleaver and we mentioned already this means Lane to do this could be the time to stop for this one is Jensen needs to think a minion finds a bit there the minion will fall and he has no chase guy who pushed out to miss a bit of XP but not too much so smart ass Yahoo to play Tool's the top slide because he had a vision on the outside wall now I see it was the ending trying to look for a bit of a trade PetSmart from Jack position to weigh to not run the risk it as well he still wants to have that early learning phase of the zillion but it's very Olin for Champion that later on in the game kind of feels a lot to mitigate your value in private TruGreen very strong want to go back to you notes solution pack is going to have a busy is that late-game insurance policy that they rely on the plane they've got themselves a pushing Lane in the form of the a trust as well this could be a simile game as to what we just do with the it tried it that three-pronged attack that is able to play sober up in the lane to see about leaving pushed in right now that farm is going to go to faculty should be close to equal here with words to make sure he can stay safe and Spence Karen can't go for anything too scary really cool from mlxg because we talked about a lot to me coming out there until he has gone into topside Vision I will take away how usually the most experienced valuable camp on the outside of the major already himself toward that level six Matos while it's not having impact on the lane is doing a good job of providing Beach and information and should be at level six Everly than expected liquor store now it's Titi least 30 burn that to get back in Lanesville feed Isaac missing a lot if they kill does come through has to respect what this could be from Let Me In mlxg cuz I knocked and roll recall and he can stay safe checking back in the bottom Lane A to Z and minks live in a great shot sounds of 80s so far and not showing any type of slowing down here we see this a lot and when they said to be to match of tends to happen sneaky behind in the laning phase that has been kind of hanging around the Lansing from Zazzle what could have been a signal to go in but not going to find it here a flight backwards is still there and Mingo 200hp going to have to cut away turn first floor go to Cloud 9 9 9 hookah most landed I kept in a bit tomorrow or the last so I should say that's be nice trucks didn't know that until they're pretty safe recall kill credit as you mentioned did go to the Jungle expense Karen going to feel happy about this one and I could stop playing around the boat Lane this is where they had issues the first time they met and we said it earlier in the day sneaky and these were able to mitigate the pressure but now they've actually found themselves and nearly killed Guardian pretty good Arun is very crucial and solution to this one plays out we're going to have basil through the lamps in back immediately flashing for the plate and it was something rather than try and shut down Target McKnight town on the rakan kill that is still an advantage in the bottom line for Tuesday also I mean I talked about it a lot so far but the smoothness of the Autumn pop pollution you know the fact that I feel as well as attack damage do you get a tax paid on the 1st by as well just makes you feel a lot more comfortable in that lady face look worse than 1/2 HP let me of course has the ultimate phrase easy in and let you know she is not hatching a word in this brush licorice is Wayback Lane is going to be a slow walk that is one of the most obvious that outside think I've ever say Dallas Telegraph play I think of the top. Of licorice respecting it is well going to back away it's been a little bit more is gold very early on aboot sent to be better Cloud 9 while you can see Jensen is even the games Sandra inmates in the top side of Matt licorice is now down 15cs but let me will go back to Baseline Liquors from clothes I got a little bit more so far for the Goldie's is going well then mitigating this early learning strengths on you does have his most impressive and you can say now they feel like I have pressure in the back memes that show who feel totally safe and Karen have to be a little bit careful on this one is it keeps running backwards it's not going to be slow down there will be no reason to Old the reason the ultimate answer answering and guarantee Jensen how do you say salty that means it went to level six times through now but mlxg there's a window for them to
