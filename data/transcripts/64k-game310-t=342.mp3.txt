I'm so far both teams have been rising to the occasion Cloud 9 now get their opportunity to be able to do that against RNG this should be a great man to look absolutely should be Cloud 9 has very very bad really games none worse than the match against R&G back in the first week but they have shown a little bit of better fortitude in the first 20 minutes here today and we'll see if they can hold up against Uzi and then because Nikki's they both have been having bad Lenny faces and I think so much was through Jensen that Catalyst in the midline of the ability to get the early game finally rolling in that day but he had done it throughout the play in fade he hasn't really thinking on that many of the stuff I like the fact that they got away from the galio that they headed back towards the LeBlanc and now shall who a player that has risen to the occasion on big stages internationally as he's worth not answering because I tend to form Disturbia Terry match up in 2 pics in Vans and Royal never give up giving some respect to the landing phase Draven Bandolino Nocturne very standard for C9 to run dive heavy compositebackroom still up I don't expect a talk to be picked as a result try to deny even more of those pics and it leaves us with the you would think Tyson's first pic that says Nikki has not been leaning too well on the Champions instead of this Fresh Beat Band Roofing flea make from cloud nine things like new. Auntie April's are available as well and you would imagine that Kevin, I have shown a counter to both of them than more than happy to let either one of them through to Z on Ty's to be no surprise no one picks and bans you got the best player in the coming through at us where the road is he is set up to carry even on Chancellor and this is interesting because when he was put in the situation he also defaulted back to a civil case so I wonder what is the next kid of the 80Perry Lanes Heath whether it is something like a virus something like a gene that we've seen a lot of whether they do just goes at like game scaling the last time we still plan on going up against in the plains lissandra the tank lissandra as a means of dealing with it and why you don't win the lane you really don't lose it and you can access the front line later on to the game but for the Civil that you were talking about it's going I wonder if they still have that in mind whether or not they course you're thinking okay I'm going to go with the aatrox championlooks to be a bit more like maybe in an orange game even when you've got more damage out what else were you need a front line for the Nuggets being locked in and that's of course going to be flexible screen brightness and support for me between Douglas fir and I think it is one of those pics that right now with being flipped into the sport more often as a support champion pool tend to be more play making right now we have some saying something negative support the most popular house paint on kitchen that has look good but Brougham at the same time hasn't really found his place in the current world met up so I would expect that to be mean to Casa has a very large champion pool and potentially an area where cloud and I can actually see and Olaf but I think that he does have more to show off that very true and right now Royal never give up just targeting the outside of the map giving that got the best possible match of it sounds even signing away the lissandra this surprises me we already talked about it as a means of an answering to the hats they have something in mid-length something like that is currently left out an availablebut they don't want to keep that over to Yahoo given that he did play earlier in the day I became quite ounces is a very viable solution because even though LeBlanc has starkly tainted has proven to be one of the safe of lipase repetitively taken away I also think that you can give a lot of credit to licorice because he is an Innovative and we keep saying if there is a time for another pocket pig that would be right now the Cloud 9 I'm interested to see if the young man has one as well along with the victim and flies account in the looking at in the Kali cake and I Midland could also be sent up towards the top side of the map to one that has been known to play akali into the air and it can be a pretty strong split push threat the question is wolverine look so grab it for themselves and put it in the mid lane or they just went through when you go to carcel by the very best friend was in the world maybe even the best if he can beat score maybe later on in the tournament either way as though they are going to be waiting for the Middle Lane ticket to Darien and less he forgot gets wet down there for xiaohu so Cloud 9Mammoth lock in their lineup Thalia almost certainly is jungling so who's leading the blind pig syndrome most likely and we'll see what top winner cloud and is waiting to pick for licorice afterwards because if you are throwing the gauntlet of potentially taking a match a black and a collie into it however as you mention it has been placed into the top successful yet it's a completely different question in my opinion I completely agree right now, I'm just texting a lot of options available to them we will see Jensen on bats and turn right now they have a lot of stuff they don't really have outside of the ultimate that much more limited than it does allow Jensen to be a little bit further up in the land I think the last time we saw this was actually on Jensen side and on the Assassin was able to play very aggressive if you swapped that especially with a tub flame sheddoes not give the same place is going to be the top latest show who we playing these Sion mid and should be nearly invulnerable against syndrome the puppy comes we thought they had gone away from a dangerous team that we have seen historically but when push comes to shove Royal showing that they still have so much faith in the best player in the world and it was sneaky that was dismantled in the bottom Lane Uzi just told him up hot and it was largely where they snowboard the game frog can sneaky stuff up so far today he's had a great the phone with a code that is built around enabling Uzi and making him the carrier of this team or I'd be on spooky to see how he handles the precious absolutely eyes on the bottom line is is coach Shakeand there's a chance to meet again in a tiebreaker later on at the end of the day there is a chance he's that these teams could battle for first is a lot of seating still up for grabs with an r and g win they guaranteed to be one of the topics to be determined based on the later game Cloud 9 know this love test ahead of them as well however today has been a day for upset and c9mic make that Seaforth in a row if they can Dethrone RNG be raining MSI Champion what most people consider the best team in the world they did follow through against team Vitality C9 going to hope to capitalize on that but there is still a very top Taps Yahoo Louisiana rest of our Angie are absolutely incredible flares Horry have an amazing day of games Cloud 9 vs Royal never give up heads once again groupie will conclude today North America have the right kind Cloud 9 make it to top 8do in two versus three in one only ones you've been eliminated so far and either team it a law still has a chance to battle back through a make their way into this one a lot of play for not a time to lose just yet they're still more games to play for both of these teams has he has a gigantic Frontline in front of him in carcere what are the best lease in the world can set up the early game so well. We talked a lot about oranges composition which is very much protect the guy so protected you have a lot of Meatballs got a lot of skill for the Kaiser and basically you're going to rely on her at once you choose three items A to B. Primary damage be the while the rest of the conversation is engaging but the Cloud 9 they have a couple of early game options they can take advantage with the cinder play making in the mid you do have some set up but would you mind of Tanks Animal of lame person to R&G have in Midland talk it may be difficult 49 to find those early I'm one of the strengths of the Scion pick it as a tall plant is the ability to show about the lane rotates what's a maid rotatewhat's the jungle in create control what we have seen from flash. So I finally told him it is it can replicate that place out in the middle and spit towards bottom they use it to get Betty ahead in those situations trust her and put him on a cat carry to watch list because of how well they've been playing around him well this was the first carry on that list and now shall who gets to visit that way frequently and let's see if they can execute on it and I thought the Red Bluff Police goes over the fence. No issues will wait for next at the pants to come around is Carson's going really buff debuff and then be around the bottom Lane Cypress cuddling up might be had here is the waves are pushing back and forth and then want to step up and the dream scenario this time around is it Cloud 9 get to get to about level five and start shopping outfits wave and being able to control them anyway if you can do that you can minimize a lot since you took so much of the damage last time was it Susie had the better reigning 80 Harry and xayah vs to Kaiser will be with us that still holds true nowprice of a ranch and then it goes back and no harm no foul really they aren't quite able to get the other push the kind of struggling a little bit to the Lane deficit in a civil and this is somewhat what you expect even kysek not considered the strongest laning Champion she can still apply a bit of fresh request you with the amount of zoning controls the garage has been game given that he has control of the button for the time being pressure mink with Boris mean I could not step up at first he weighs 111 to 4-in cso already a great start and we got to leave Fitz just stopped in the vision they know he's there. Christine I can stop this at all is well movie into the outside of the Jungle so much Vision already invest in the side of the map Fallout yes already original reports about it coming into the draft this was the guy that really struggled a gangstas bought land from aren't you the last time we met up with while this is what you would expect in the other laying faceSummoner Shield Bernie's thank you for coming down from Zanesville to let us at least a small issue but look at this car stuff already ready for the first week he was in danger but look how much more Pharmacy 9 is losing world of do I have to fly around to Z and they are absolutely blasting the bottom line and the first stage is survival in right now you can see the cloud nine it's just battling to be able to survive putting so much effort into it topside 420 Fest performers of Cloud 9 has been Licorice and so far to stop playing look very very good or God's been incredibly lame dominant before that is a at least a point of 49% is not that carry that it will be later on and we supposed to have a different place I was in the bottom line the ability to take something like an is really try and come online before the tithe it gets to that Lake and carry unfortunately to tip a fan that is not the case with this Champion it still is a create user who needs to be able to feel. VCS advantages Hussein members be able to do it well so far but so far in this game it looks like sneaky has been struggling this is looking a little bit more promising as we look for a bomb official site and Jose is going to take some damage will stop getting burned out on that side make a sound of someone is supposed to force out of plane was so close to hitting to Z as well just to the millimeter how far he could get away but it's right down again coming in from spin being able to push that in their advantage. It's a pretty big deal. I thought it was risky business and he did have to also there to access support for Spencer and he was looking around just behind the tower they finally get some gold back and it was he did stay and picked up most of the XP on that way but he will still lose almost the entire full next wave it is not a canon meaning it's easy to push in silver has an advantage of sub who's he will be more like vice versa as a chef come through I'm you fly around the mess of rest of the map and it's actually Cloud 9 members it is starting to generate a little bit of that event we noted on the analyst test how much RG right now seem to be focusing on that bottom Lane that were able to secure the pics that they wanted to know if it's very early picks Vol 2 Z and me in this drop at licorice Jensen you feel that they have stopped talking to rise to the occasion they are this game is tied in the early game and that's not what it was like for C9 last time these teams met I do want to talk with you tomorrow cuz he's the most important player on this refuse going pickaxe first two rays that will be less early-game power for him better scaling overall by skipping the storm razor Esparza has snuck into this Russian the top play next. Just looking for an opportunity to try and get let me hit or miss girl just barely Miss important slice really prefer to not gay but if you're beyond that slowly and I might have to burst a killing his heart's a pretty high-level has some damage their Yahoo fighting for war to get pushed back by Jensen just themselves + 14 CS in the mid lane not that show who needs to win Lane of course but it is good for density has too much Farm the most PSN the game has been having a great game Safari but also a great day earlier in the day his performance was a really big part of why climbing Rabil to get that win over Genji I just think it was kind of Highland and how he has a place you didn't have the best play in stage 4 lot of this split supportive midline into the city playing around, but today we kind of soil Revitalize Jensen the Assassin play as it could really take his pee much further in the world championship was willing to pick things the lactic acid in like the Aralia in the play and stay put the Rhythm just wasn't that he was never able to find you through Crown feeds give him couple of little braids you have to be good again in this lady face is starting to feel good Vantage and I have the casa until very late gave you another Cinderella is how I will put it kind of look at what options are is Casa looking for
