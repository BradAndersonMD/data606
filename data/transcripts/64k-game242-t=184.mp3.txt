winning record coming into this week's game but they're three in one command and effect bar from those top three teams Cruz ever run across the board was expecting yet DSM liquid 290 be dominating but it is at the top of the table and they are looking to maintain The Undefeated record I think optic thus far I've had a great start but if they can take down cloud nine year as well no beating this Tina is just behind them in the standings I think that answers even more question about where is the team's limit how good really are they did they just have a couple first thing I'm looking for a video start the game either 100 or 200 and once we can Cloud Nine 2013 summer Katie a 13-point * * 12.7 I'm sad I definitely would belike some of these bands are coming up from Cloud 9 we've talked a lot about banning the TV not necessarily just what is the meta and so many people have been kind of just I think autopilot banding at full you Ben Affleck fixing and that's what you do flies have to take that off the table as well as starting to play a bigger not metal bands whatsoever this is the thing that makes a lot of sense. Some people were talking about well should you be banning the DF I've been cramping for a lot of different style I think that often has not shown that they can play heavily around that Top Lane so now the question becomes does dhokla have a replacement tank that they're going to put them on or do they then Depot back to Carry's which is much more that's spring look for optic which really had not been working out for them as well you mentioned the band to me on 59 there is there prep essentially given the optionKimbo Slice counter picks in the draft Cena has collection they chose earlier from last Sunday was the gragas Yasuo in that was Barbara playing McGregor so this may very well be why he is sitting in on stage for the specific strategy perhaps he is more practice with it this is the end if they got to bring out and is really really exciting to see this already such an explosive when you me actually does the jump onto another member if you know that is a pimpyou making that be stranded sometimes too far away from the rest of the team if you can separate her out and when she is without someone actually latch on to see how it plays out in the game itself second round of bands are coming through his office now to look at the fact that cloud 92 bottomley I thought of the fact that I need a top laner and a jongleur so you're going to get dropped off the table will do it comes in there and he has been this year he is been the go to carry the guy that sings Really prior to getting ahead of this is also what's the LG ran with a guy in weed one they actually ran UV silver they had incredibly successful game with that really worth it can go over and pick up and I think stepping up the farthest place though they are going to have their opportunity to carry the game here to from the bottom sideOptical in Cloudy with a chance please diastole over the rakan band the allister band drop some is basil engage off bins and then there's the porch with Knocked Up on the kit but they're still Nautilus there's still several other options out there Kenneth another Top Lane band has been thrown at 2:00 you can do Nautilus but Nautilus never feels good to play this differ it's so damn easy to spell Scheels at ultimate that it feels like you just never able to actually hit it I just started would make a lot of sense here for a media's going to plug you playing another candle holders jungler in there someone who can be freely thank you alongside that there's no future fries are the main question on my mind is still really do they have a replacement tank for do cleft or is it going to be another Carrie trying to save that for the last picconsidering Ezreal here now would mean that you're going to be playing more defensive Lane as real problem is about as offensive the gas but I think that makes sense when you're playing Jocelyn to call alongside gragas getting attention to those toll lanes and bought Lanes likely going to be on an island there's nothing okay you guys go down to the bottom size 350 or potentially freebie tooth is jungle is coming down the block Buick used with the shield you can actually stop a lot of those their life is going to be seen Guardian as well so if a lot of ways to prevent that but they can hear for dhokla so it will be a carry no backup tank and it's kind of follow-up after that Poppy Gangplank is being as a fairly good matchup into that a call if you can hit barrels in the Stroud pretty effectively yapping said if you do fall behind a call he definitely has all in potential especially alongside someone like you drag us through pain play aggressively but it to me says you actually want to play through boughtDP survive on an island up on the top side use your office down to the bottom Lane is crowned be on the sidelines and in pain ringing in perhaps Garner with those were attacked that bottom line this is going to be a really really exciting game I do think I might have a very explosive draft but it's one that's so much harder I think to pull off with Joselyn a collie haven't been Dash through this team and Diving to the theme there's so much to see between humans ultimate the rise ruthless Garner ultimate they have to play it really well yeah it's going to be a disco on the palate Optical Miss playoffs are four and zero and looking sharp so far last, to the coaches they will leave the team against so far we haveit works for them it's time around don't know tank different size of the map and it will say if you're going to play Carrie based on the style that we have seen optic playing you can makes a lot of sense. They fix for this is my bad for them playing Garry's and stop playing with little play to that side of the lane he doesn't need it we will have an inside with Optical FaceTime stop was that machinethank you very much I'm here what's up with you in the coach of all states ever seen up tickets undefeated still coming into this weekend have to play Cloud 9 today did you get the drift you wanted to keep the undefeated streak alive reprise from the ship. I get done to come to be used in the past we have a lot of tools and I'll come we'll see how it goes it's a very slow, but I think we have chances to win I think it's a 50/50 raffle think it was expected given to the airplane scene at a special in Gastonia do you know we used to be about team replacing an academy used to it no worries Mustang Pacific or the game back to the costumes for the callI love that little bit of a peek behind the curtain yeah Academy though to be fair and he's kind of self-deprecating there a little bit but a lot of people have been telling me that last bit was that you just beating a lot of elcsd Instagram's in a lot of people using I just got to be viewed as a scrum partner because they had so many talented players so they have time to like to use going to be excited see if they can pull it off here it's going to start with some harassed what's Nikki back full HD here but this is going to beGuardian pasta block of the damage boomerang blade look at that look about a team that this is what give me Silver not only is that q that kind of beer you can drive it through the minions and and I can connect the only way to really Escape is just running straight away and getting outside the rain but even then you're going to be missing a minion movies new hits slow it makes it damned if you could actually hit the boomerang blade as a follow-up so it's a very powerful combo but as we see additional levels come and get your 49 on the Bromfield can be fairly effective as expected he is running Guardian there's kind of help deal with them that Folk really at War comes out for this key but this is what a fun things about junglers going early sleeper now is the fact that so many of those Wards are there so wrote Every Pro does them at the same time every game you like well you know if I didn't you put it down I will always put this word out and a free zombie where to look into place there and also noticed that both of us after on fleet footwork to deal with some of the folk of the are both malate Champions and they're going to be dealing with you mistaken for a centrally Kathleen McGrath GP very very difficult when you no longer have access to them anyway so there is any free helpful for a collie and likewise got to a also going towards as well as a lot of focus on here from cloud nine there's not too bad there is Big also put some if the shield and tricks pretty well but I'm already more than a full wave a headgear for Optics is that is very significant know in these early levels and it happened to play it so far back so far. Eventually be here comes blabber looking at oxide plant BP Flash and he was going to the right side of gameplay he doesn't even need to flash follow so that was actually a very beautiful Jiang fare from blabber really well Play-Doh Cuzzo well-timed orange and we'll use the flash to get out still that does mean both Summoners down your Ford Oakland he's going to have to be a lot more careful in these next couple minutes all right now if any way would push toward face the fact that a liquid has more plus that healthier Canon so it's probably has to be a teepee coming in and indeed it is we cannot spell how far what's up a longsword to make him feel pretty comfortable is actually trying to hold a wave Inn in such a way that you know if your classes that for an expose himself to any potential aggression you know when you do have it pushing a little bit towards you because it was there certainly can be a dangerous spot for GP and if you do not know where gragas is you've got to be very careful but it's going down already at 5 minutes and they're down a lot of farm because they're down at 62 weeks of barbet is not really big deal this early on and you can see it yourself in that gold DC up for both of these Vault liner so if they ever run out of man or else or whatever is going to be thinking right back in the lane and and stay he knows present their you've already rare if you want you can pick you up at a medium to your attack damage items without problem as being a rat ear is there for stinky so it's not a terrible recall in any point in time for you to eat it by force if you can keep as real losing 10% of all farm going to keep going there and if you can actually just push him under the turret and then be able to recall and save your TV that's even better right you know if you can force him back and thus far it looks like they already forced back to base videos just Jordan board it and that was all that it required that she pushed him off because they're very nervous about a potential dive at first recalled very likely here diesel stepping boards will be able to do to prevent that for now but he's down below calf help as he eats both sides of a boomerang blade and how it is absolutely roasted in the bottom line for the sheen or I should say that this more power now bill machine right away and not talking to your so he's going for power try to stay alive where is First Blood turns all the face around back to type gold found on the board of the killing this key is a really big deal you're also going to be able to turn it into an infernal if your bid and jungles are getting more priority that means the bottom line is more dangerous than the bush trophic so do a lot of good gunfight at 1 till for the tide of 5 9 and 3/4 double longsword plus the pickaxes a ton of 80 here so he does shredding through it one more time by simply perfect vision there a way you can have a reactor that from meteos Bodyslam flash for from fog really well done steak plays hashtag alpheus take place at LCS official new Twitter account who dis for the ALCS then now it stopped Wayne's bike videos on the right has a red bump and that is a clean one for nothing earlier jungle pressure he did not have a splash action survive and pencil all in no blabber getting a lot of work done already here involved essentially in that toppling pill as well that first what's a really off to a good start regardless he gets it down and the day just turned off push back into his jungle
