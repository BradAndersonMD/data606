Eastside of balance I think that the big swing point, I think is one way that I D could go right now because fanatic love to play craps of across-the-board they don't always play with respect to the jungler because they have such confidence in their individual play in their mechanics to carry them through and that can make you vulnerable to games and I actually already love how the fans are kicking up so far because it's what's the weather for Tuesday for both of these teams. Get the shy and Rook you're such a threat has Assassin's the arelious and the akali Tom pinch remove the safety from the bottom Lane to let Jackie Levin Balin punished is it so hard for me to even add pork chops on a scentwould love to play a skill match up here he would love to play something that is less punishable I will see if he is going to be able to find that for himself crispy calistar is so exciting for an LVL lineup is actually pretty clever though because what they're trying to do is take away that good match of the toppling for the shy they're saying great you wanted to play either side of the urga aatrox match are you willing to play a much more risky maktub you know if you don't even know which ones going we're so if you were to say you're a pretty clever it doesn't get very heavily physical damage though because it doesn't really play ap boss that's what I was going to say there's no real playing a little bit more of a tank with why I like this seeing how well I GPS engagement ring a paint fight I can be a risk but do you think Tilia right away and then I'm going to be nosey look for them from here in the bottom Lane to add to our safety down there I agree with your point about being physical in the cop somewhere and popular anymore if you can still do like to have some damage but burning play Denzel or something along those lines they shy play the Gangplank Top Lane and then it doesn't matter they just run it each other over and over again Blanc one of the champion set the Top Lane what she has always really preferred historically has the IG does want to Target his champion pool again often does not like as much but it is going to be banned away anyway all right choice I'm going to go walk in right away no hesitation there for Fanatics site and they're going to wait for the jungle pick last I don't expect the atrox Whittier got to go there I think the success in that rolls of it limited but what would be the flex who is Tristana this is certainly I think a fairly weak Laney face but I still think that Reckless and his style of play his work very well with it you love to build attack speed he loves the force that is because Donna style it'll come down to if I G can hold the way even if we are going to get oh my God this is really incredible to watch what I said earlier really does come into play because great this is a counter pick Isaac is a lot farther of a matchup for Peoria this is going to be so ridiculously high for this game IG in the group in fanatic to prove their worth against his IG team trying to force a tiebreaker and claim of first place C and forward motion aggressive compeer fanatic there are no Farmington Invictus model damage type not a huge problem here for Fanatics will see with a massive go over all with this is going to be an exciting one for first place in the group fix a no and it's theirs by right The Fanatic when we get a tiebreaker right after this one and essentially a game 3 will decide who is taking the top spot first these definitely much more important for the koala better in that second seed at the quarterfinals certainly a bit easier for the winter here aggression all-around how these teams could stack up against each other cuz when you have rides for you or you can play one so he want and do the exact same thing if this becomes a meatloaf I do worry about the ability to get in Sallisaw a champion. You always talk about first engagement at the same time extremely credible write this could be a difficult game fanatic to really be able to pick them off in that one teapot it is very true but the same time Fiora is not that good of a team better it is very 52 Dubai on this Champion if you use the report that the wrong time you will get shredded you are not building those things. So I do think we're going to be I'd be pretty heavily pushing that can be dangerous for fanatic as well because in that late game can get a match up against the atrox play the pee or NCR God because cats have taken the atrox I think this is a very smart moving so when we talked about a draft while we are on to summoner's Rift you heard those teleports coming in a battle for first in the group on the line Chinese fans clearly in attendance who you're rooting for IG Europe is showing up as well all right have a game this is certainly going to be exciting we saw that your bow at the very end of Champions elect their of course if you're mentioning as a lure. Risky or the intended matchup for fanatic and I think the big thing here to me is that one team if they sideline is full of behind has a very good disengage you have a look at things out Tristana as well as Brawn they going to accelerate going backwards so you know if it works and caps get ahead in the sidelines I can push in that court is hurting Asian on the flip side however if I G sideliners get ahead it's going to be half of Russia and he'll the song to generate engages so I think that it's early game and is so important to play the words with hoes Lane I think that they need to be able to generate a gold leaf Fiora from behind is one of the worst champion in the game that's why I'm ahead she's insufferable go to sings the true and only imagine to walk for a volatile top when is going to be exciting she is going to play that leads directly Boaz they hardly comes in for Brockton really think you do have to expect do that for this year again Ciara got it is going to be very tough early on or got very likely going to have the push for a lot of it is going to be able to harass me or under the church as she's trying to farm up and no certainly I think it takes a while for if you are to be able to come online unless there is Google internet big brother to get stoned about Lindo decent trade in there for breakfast a barrier or I should say Guardian block them at all the damage than I still have the first push in this Lane so skill matches thought maybe we could start with a rockstar and stuff in the bottom side quickly actually that was rather listen to Scuttle to make sure that least admit he couldn't bring that one around as he leave in a drink at work watching the other way through the lane really like that just to be able to protect Reckless on the bottom side he wants to push on the drisana it's going to be about shoving in so get that schedule a little bit more vision is safety for that fanatic bottom Lane but I do believe but sent out camping this brush he comes down but he's not biting edge of the Bride Nevada how close to the wall hug you out but also isn't easy to take out from the pixel brush so I like the reward position they're also allows for the map to just be sleep now play sleeping award in that location at level one and ige revisits what's the word back down that it was trying to get there for to buy very smart or to buy idea but very very very smart and unsung in that one and while there is a push for now for the fewer it's very much because we thought before leaching thought he was over at the red so sure I was able act the crap that Wade getting going in his Direction you do you have your first fast and it out as you go into a game and he would have to look for my opportunity yet have two heads just throws a bilities at the Fjord. Doesn't really throw it it take for your eye if a standing within the crate website not waiting to see ASRock to getting a little kind of done with himself is going to try to walk into that side of the Jungle didn't find much now fighting for these chickens like he was going to land and very little as a keystone away drops and Lucy lost time down there but he will have a couple can still kind of retreat you on the top side and there's no cast up right now for ning so he can either try to look for some gangster ass or just simply reset on the map and it looks like he is trying to get in position to come over the wall with rookie guard range but not going to happen there now he shows and their benefits coordination and this is something that I should be through Santa turn off the top of the Crank It Up by Ciara doesn't have to back on the phrase did you can say right now there's a big as hell just off hard if you had to go back you could be another way so I like this actually a nice guy but you have to believe rookie and she's not in this fight it was taken some damage there I got my name is wrong for no good reason before we called there so we can try to set up that freeze trying to deny some of the farm from Rookie and may Force rookie the TP back what she does to make sure that way you can crash rubber caps is sitting on it night and is down on the farm so credit to rookie for a strong early laning phase and last time these two men leaders did BD certainly got the best of caps as well night pretty big farm Lee + 18 this early a truck fixed so far not doing well slow magic Mantel in Boots the first item cast trying to sort of suffer through this one that's almost just got to make a bad matchup for the shy but that was not paying for it yet he's equal in farm and tapped his suffering through it to that point with it has also gone for the Bramble that for his first item so it's not like he's looking to dominate will keep him very safe he's probably never going to die so I can't trade ever cuz I'll take more damage than a deal so I didn't make a lot of sense for the match up to ensure you can never lose the link yea and I would say you can also sometimes for straight more aggressively with this item because there is less appealing and with that ultimate perhaps no be able to actually make something happen in the wealthy want but we'll see how it was able to do up there that now they should I just make me play against the way without any additional ID can you push hard enough to get engaged I try to walk down to get to find a slope has arranged for it to head down that had the ultimate available that could not getting rain right play from Fanatics a funny show progression yeah I really nicely done there for a boxer to be able to get down there Reckless and Hilla saying able to set it up and we'll see now it's the shiz able to get any sort of Advantage up on the top side but you're very aggressively in this Lane for trading and I think this is just a place towards that cuz he just wasn't immediately after the fact that he's jungler right now in NeNe's on Crump camp that is just a very bad play from Belen to look for her ass at that stage then that much River Vision either other than that navigate to mention a spotted owl that went poorly so fanatic tide and gold as this game moves forward the Midland Farm different still masses answer though by the fact that first one of the Jungle is night and hang out and I delete anzio Tristan or accelerated a lot of the problems we've been discussing for fanatic U Toys R Us in the midline as well as maybe a slightly more defensive perspective on the matchup he's a very good thing out of one of the best champions in charge of going up against you do a meal a call on the side of my Jeep could open up very quickly yeah I really could I mean if you get Reckless ahead you can group and perhaps Bush worth if you were to come to you before she is really ready for that stage of the game and we'll see if an addict is going to be able to do it because hers Lee IG does have the form of Damages in a number of these lanes and that is why that kill for a rock that was so important to really get this team back to even Keel there is a great Catalyst he is very aggressive with Lady continually looks for his own place and looks the same place so I think that you know you think he's a man but call from Cops arguably do you want to have a gold late and he's going to be processed at any Ulta impacted one of the most volatile Lane in that bottom line at this stage you know, so once again very short-range will want to look for those crappy 5 can be taken advantage of elegant still at the game if that's going to start taking some of the Jungle away this is one of the good things about Midlands with cc to get take scuttled give your topside some vape pen and Pad your stats find 114 gold
