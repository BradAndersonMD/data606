some difficulties in adjusting and it showed up in their score you know a lot of their losses have been some devastating losses whereas still they you're going especially Rift Rivals were looked at Astro's makers best team for sure if the truck is representative they have not had the consistency though and now even though Cloud 9 are coming at 2 and 6 they are still very top of phone is dead do they put decongestant back in those It Go ourselves into Champs like I always like to to leak details from a pregame shot in the lobby because he wants the countdown to shut up that shows amazing if you didn't see it was talking about race that could have been an old lady being one of them and let me go in first pick be in Kindred Moses bands a very successful year time around we do have the Zoe as well as cilia and those last two spots for blue and red Sparrow the kindred's the one that got Brew Premier jungler right nowbecause not only just get to scale very well with Marcus you know he wants to get going to add two tons of damage as well as ranged the champion but early game is also powerful is looking and choosing commercial song as you don't make mistakes like bass backing into people will see if they're able to keep track of the marked as well as look for some of that pressure always know you're going to be able to trade the other high do Champions you mentioned in champ select all of our last game for Ghana with the black shield as well as the finding potential for picking Champions off and has gone through the roof is my expired Dayton Heracross it's been one of his absolutely long-term best Champions xmithie definitely really great on the ground. As well if it gets even to this is still pretty flexible keep in mind thatMorgan has a farming bot later on sneak peeks at the Port is pretty rough deal with almost everybody played are swaying to be flexible between Denton and sneaky do I do expect it to be very annoying primarily played as a support now for people huge harassment with the darkwind Inland still has a very annoying fear that you can just pull off practically a terror to frost your after shocked very good for the kids actually in the bottomlands yet often do you go if you feel wanted and the other one's going to try and get off the damage and have to be so kind of close to fear one of them was trying to focus with the other but after shot gives you so many flat resistances it's actually in Spain for those two5-second yep you get about the math on the gold value about two pairs of gold value cuz it's just not worth it a certain point you the way it's very good now Jen has been locked in for doublelift in the bottom line this has been one of his actually I think that's typical double of champion hard during mechanical out play 1029 kind of guy he has been exceptionally good Anjin specifically he had some kind of obvious affinity for the stamping I think it's going to be a very good look for him going to be good at keeping him alive as well so I do he's a pretty good look repeal a lot of comfortable champion bull a one of his nose when do Champions board after raw eggs make a paper dragon Saint Augustine for me double of his gym as well and the combination of these to write not only are these races for those who has a lot of children and we've seen themwho plays here in the North American LCS no Landing bindings on different things like that resulting in kills 14 liquid so how fast do you get with people building The Storm razor go all this extra boost me that he'd be able to build into crit so how quickly he can move around when he's able to prosthesis V bucks yeah it does make a very mobile Marksman even though people look at it dumps fuel or gasoline spilled into a sweat it just runs he is real Swift. So fast by the way the best YouTube series of all time is game adults as well as a fast on YouTube full crit Poe type beat Jen it's actually amazing great editing as well and I understand that you would love to play thank the top limit orders received nerve after the Murph after nerve and they stillthe very best tank I find that interesting but that is what they go for they may not consider him the very best tank saved the most reliable initiation Rite his ultimate is one theater that you can't deny me to come back here the first one was scheduling for Clutch Gaming workouts at the ultimate I mean how much they have the nerve to champion before you you're like I'm not willing to put up with this guy in exchange for this amazing team by ultimate because typically it's been in his ultimate obviously very long-range huge area of effect for crowd control combination with a strong lady faceside-by-side the Nerf afterburner for horn and seems to be a very good answer because horn does have multiple Dash that you can interrupt with it said best friends all right so Champion Select is over and if I don't like going to be devil made for cloud Diamond casket over that with Oriana and sways going to be locked in his are too big to be rolled down there sneaky going to be playing at the ladder your project is well known for his Oriana some more standard competition here for being like it honestly this is middle of Springs but you look at this looks like a very Standard Spring split Champions to look for them but a bit of a new looking for Cloud 9 coffee in four Liquors about seeing him play with the battle for the blabber making it any LCSW on Kindred cord with a very strongest gun dealer in League of Legend champions for him and I think it's a worthy choice right here going to be a fun one to watch for Cloud 9 have a lot of ground to make up their cool games behind a spot in the playoffs with 10 to play big makeup distance and CloudI'm having to face Team Liquid going to be a hard one to gain ground on cloud nine story here of their road to playoffs for them to try and qualify to Worlds it's an exciting what this is a team that went back when they had high on this roster were able to make the miracle run and actually qualify for worlds and then play pretty well as far as the tournament went away your it does look up rewards in this in bed by the way isn't going to have anyone collapse on him but we do get a little bit of exchange of vision here for the supportshow do I choose kind of expand out 5-man Squad and then we make sure there's no deep invades couple of cricket worst rated places in that sort of dragon area bladder gets first damage and then Smith the heels up Lily all of it going to be able to start the W no problem there for Smithy what is it into Kendra matchup that is why the Grog us is actually quite highly prized even though Kindred is so strong right now and knock backs are very effective against this Champion obviously the ultimate from Kindred puts down his own that your team is going to try and stay on and go against the will try and knock you off with the bear and a very well play dragas can make a kindred look like a fool however that requires very good play and accurate scale shots from the gragas that's true so well it is a counter it requires good play to execute on that counter the other part of the cow is also in the early game Bodyslam flash is very good at closing the distance on Kendra Turley and a large part of Kindred advantage in early tools is because of the rain and try to dodge with your dancing arrows so we'll see hear about the match up because kids you can also a farm that broadcast if everything is the left bar on us trade from gen from right there walking up as well to put down his soldiers and we're going to have much better Auto attack than a year does blabber pretty convenient for a staff right there gets it on the top side of his already heading up there on the Kindred so one so far right now but back to camp now on the Rafters so I got to be a very heavy farming route not even looking for any aggression the early game definitely do not want to have a kindred especially with Red Bluff find you at a camp and some of the office right now Zanesville and sneaky only at 60 at the first two waves that was an old lady great job with that bush portal Mage hard to Auto Tech minions under Taurus well is there mechanic mobile service kit for Dublin and with sticky back in the lineup he's actually quite a lot of the Mages like you're talkin about the Morgana this is one of the things where he spent a long time for Cloud 9 on the academy froster yet to CS that weighs doublelift anole doing good job pushing them in again with their more combo that you mentioned being so comfortable for them. Where to get a good Advantage Iowa let's go to the side stage with oblong who checked in with now coach K's and how he felt about chance reflect these guys just got finished speaking with Coach Kane I wanted to pick his brain about that as beer pick he said that they totally expected the Oriana coming from Cloud 9 and pobelter was super confident that he could win that match up Sonic site and see how it plays out back to you guys how could tell me I look with the gate coming into the top size liquids can I make sure that you can't go anywhere either but he's going to be a lot of damage in fact about 300 HP no more charges for him that starts drinking is closest in mediately but weight is pushing towards his throat so he shouldn't have to overextend or anyting biscuits also coming in there as well already traded blows that first thing come through enemies now Timothy is up to one camp in the jungle pathing though couple hundred damage might be worth the camp in the long-term we'll see what happens in back to organize items as he goes of course to put on some Library again on this weekend. That's a lot of curly potential for invade Sears getting us some fairly shallow Vision around the bottom side that will allow Jensen's in this Oriana is your match up to fuel a bit more secure hugging this bottom side of the map going he's got him protection from there cuz again a gragas body slam flash since there's no cleanse on Jensen have to wait a long time we will use your flash to get out of that one and they can very dangerous good reply to buy Olay that you saw him Black Shield before the back half of sneaky Sweeney could land a no-fault for damages get on that one but fell in the bit more equal here and now it got another attempted smithy's turn to come up and of course they pack has all the stuff for the Sun going to put up the pillar as well go for the Chargers going to be stuffed at 8:45. Way home from the top players with 50 able to finish off the kill for themselves and bonus burst blood all going to go over to this gragas now the cars that have the choice between the runic echoes in standard Halls by almost always see runic Echoes built first when you have a lot of burst damage and potential here especially with a closing in on level 6 this could be a very very dangerous gang cure for the next couple of minutes from the dragas with all that extra money that it is the Justice set up here because videos you could see right now licorice find be out playing the backside agreed again is what most people will say right here in fact too close to the Poppy Family Center has been completed for electrician he's able to get it done just with the basic abilities their looks like his Altima was used before the replay actually started so maybe I like a quick cast probably didn't actually very effective now that you can also get a little bit of damage during the week at Goldman from poppy so maybe in fact not quite expecting that one but good play from licorice this rookie of the split last seat last split their 459 has done a lot of work for the team did not fight all the changes they've been going through it all as a player coming in at umich as rookies beginning of the year and overall the only person I do not have an event at all this split which I don't mean it's like a really joke the answer but actually true they've had complete faith in him and he's been largely pretty good throughout this play as well so I think deserving of of all that starting time right now up 24c it's going to impact with a trade of equal gangs is so depressing I'm still sitting at about equal gold here in this game blabber now taking his turn at a Top Lane as soon as I've been had tag team jongleur gates up here this time it's in Cloud 9 favorite movie wanted to the parade.
