best sound for the Z but that's not how you pronounce it okay I see a Carro Pizza man I do what you did BMG to because they already wear that samurai mask all the time like it the easiest signing of all time it it as easy as T1 T1 that I wouldn't like was so excited about that happen it's like just give him a few mask I know you're watching Carlos just just just do it I like those like more low-key version though it was just looks like it's cut out of like a white piece of reuse cardboard Hollywood Undead back in 2005 or any of the other stuff what are you watching that still getting recommended to you for Hollywood Undead on YouTube so I did go back and watch like you like Trump you know they were there for it. So that's probably good to mix. Who's going to win this match back to have to be at least he favors I mean they have three former pro players with the competitive experience so I don't think it's going to be that close to we only have one boy delis out the ass so I think I think at least he has to be favored here no way you would if he gets his dareth it's going to be going to be so I don't think I'll be okay I think you made him put his I have some bad news for you I know going to be locked in I am curious if we're seeing on hit their supposed to go where you can reset all of your cooldowns off of Saxon, call Champions I want to see where it goes in the preseason we're not seeing like safe bot Lane farming want to CVS real blood yeah that would be really fun. Leave me already hit the fan table at least he's team doing a big favorite all the viewers out there knocking that champion out yep and all ready for me to pick I hope we get to see people on on their you know what their most known for its known for just picking the summer to spell ghost at this point whatever I can't wait for brightness locked in great Champion as well here's a blessing to be here for l e c I always kind of pin switch deals with one player on the Block videos like my head and my head yeah I always hated of the Brushy Brushy whatever that video was way back in the day that is just an optimist with him but he's put a lot of different shampoos done wack videos on weird building ways to kill your opponent so whatever he has cooked up in the preseason is it is tanks there have been consistent nerve to the real EOP take mythical the sunflower upgrades but I would say if you're going to pick up my router if you don't go, slides to Beaver is actually really good he don't develop tank be filled full fighter Renekton is really solid up their that's plenty of good that you can rely just on I want as well so actually ends up being right now LCS probably needs to Lance I'm guessing startzman taking a little league on the bot Lane Lula Draven is an incredibly abusive because you can appeal all the damage bead and you just went down up to do to you with Bill he was funny cuz I was when I was watching the first day all the other color casters are all like speak! Over the streets over their head about like we don't know what's going to be built my dad just because I played a bunch of Glee Finn's the first batch of head but also I have access to the internet and I can just look up like both what's Taco Bell's extendable you know I didn't have to look at the year was wrong but it's still a possibility we got fewer and pipe drop off the table so some more defensive bands to keep the top play I'll do with your to be quite strong NASA fan away from the topside as well I think Mike has a very good band there's no real Escape for either Louis or the drapes be hooked in your kind of his death so I like that as well the robe and surprises me haven't been super impressed with her so far he's really fun and I like watching her just cuz it's kind of a badass but not been super impressed with with her ability to make impactful plays in teamfights I think you something that people Excel figure out how to use in she seems really poor with coordination just with her like kind of vacuum any of those is going to work well hours for Round 2 Electric Boogaloo I am happy I love suede I love drain tanks and I love the like. That have come in over the preseason I don't I assume you're all about it I mean I just love being this annoying ball of staff is going to burn people down and swing swings my dream I play a couple games on him to make sure that they're not going away from your team they can make that follow pretty easy so I like this spell convince the last Steel ya thing is the support situation for the LEC I assume that will be 21 for PSO I was out hiking up if you're in the support position but but will still get to see some cool stuff out of him and the dive to Draven cop for the LEC and LCS doesn't have a ton of peel for that besides you know startzman on the Lulu to make it really really really really saw it at the topside I'm expecting mom is a stylus to do really well also and about Lulu and I think writing a good job would last several years of supports off more than 80 Carey it's like well yes we're giving you attack speed but don't worry it's like moose who's looking tiles as well in the shields go to matter what and don't worry pic of useful obviously index into instead of go for the AP what it's called but there is just give you a bill as well being able to beat people up and give it to you in this kind of stuff a lot of the the bus start to it to help with that as well as in Silas is a shot in butt then what is able to keep getting no kingslayer's off get the feeling back a small delay right now is teams are loading onto the rift once that delay is resolved will be in the game you'll see your face for a bit longer than maybe you want to do I do for some cases that's zero second too bad sorry deal with it but once again here I am kind of sad that you also was just playing Zac Brown I feel like you know I love all around green guy blobbing around you know that's that's like a let down a little bit Lost Boy Lost Lake rosseau have some pretty pretty night mechanics on the champion yeah she plays at super well I member at which event it was but he was playing it and I was in agreement with a bunch of pros and everyone makes good decisions on the champion so I'm a little bummed but I'm able to some stick fact that we don't know about he's going to bust out the guy that looks can't find the turret you know the old trick2g jungle style and then the camp going on. I'm going to fly out and it's going to be pretty rough like a positive things with that lane so verra slansky that's low PH guarantees find length of cloth and you're just going to have enough time to get some how's the weather in with our cue off the ferris there if that's really good tombow I want to see if we can get like a bunch of CDR on really somehow Force Wayne I know this and if it is the end of demonic so you're not going to get much going on but if you want to pull built Wayne W the duration is longer than the cool down in the coolant shorter than recall which means end Games, Stop recalls for the entire game if you think your parents are Short net that's how you beat it that's how you just get just get better and when they can reveal you forever yeah I'll be the helpful to have that one works out well and that supposed to be more dominant like the driven Lulu lemons usually pushing and this is not know it's corny environment keep on tracking jungle super well Wars aren't always been coordinating the optimal positions which means easy games as you Tulane and I always feel like in the streamer modes in like the more fun wise people Hard Target Zone it just trying to help them if we know we talked about going top for the LCS what I'm at the LEC she was going to bottom and they have a lot of like you said so could be nice Target technical issues going to head off to work and you Friends piano step thank you so much free and Mark apologies the giraffe to see the Champions are locked and I'm going straight to my draft one-trick what do you make of what you've seen so far and do you think so I think somebody else dies squat done is take to comfort you know a team that has like usually when your new onto the stage and you're feeling a little bit nervous and you're going up against like really strong opposition one of the best things you can do is just pick your company champ is there something that you played the full summary of the movie with we see trick on his very Fable 2. Write very terrifying or did he became famous off that champion right you'll have time on his Draven so you can see that they've gone to that comfort so they have that security whereas do you Squad up a little bit more creative we saw yesterday. also have no way in the jungle in my opinion the best player on the team controlling the map the macro Masta you know and I think we're going to have is just a lot of Oz smashing from things like Wayne looks like varis ultimate going in huambo combo team fighting ability to just bring the facts about why I would love to see a lot of that stressing to be perfectly honest Plano right now more seriously what is a virus support right and CHD if you're familiar. He could just go bowling and then like take all the money yesterday I caught him but he may he did something about so I take Viagra support for this matter I genuinely think that's what's going to happen now I'm not a hundred percent sure whether know that's what you think it's some kind of Polk bass thing for sure like I don't know whether you can't even go to Apu look up Rock lights out if you go crack and slide it into Ronin and you apply the root and soul to just two people and you'll and the cold and if you eat already comes back up just broken tube lights on to full bright starts right it's really over pallets in a team fights but it drains your Mana like nothing I've only practiced and practiced all by myself is there a competition around it we got to keep our eyes on means aside like does a male fight all for him to steal so if the other mini mouth isn't going full AP poll AP malphite all I'm just really excited when things start going wrong for the ALCS game for boys to sit on the stairs again in stock for whom I have no idea but someone's going to run in laying in the game Winston we hang that's the problem is that I don't know who's going to run in and he is quite good at League
