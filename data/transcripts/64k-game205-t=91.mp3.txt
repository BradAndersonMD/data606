play where they have to get an extremely good matchup for the bottom Lane for 6 a.m. and valve I was in and out and I thought it was fascinated with aphromoo said about the Nautilus work on match up half remove considers that work on favor till he didn't understand why she did that match up especially if they're trying to win the to be too obviously crd choice to do so so they thought they would be in my eyes but they have to not only take the favorite mattress but they also have to perform on them and there's a smile from Devante seem to Kiana band not pulling up his blg which stub leaves irelia up as the fans they left available for the first time all Siri I definitely think you don't want to first pick it doesn't seem like in to see that they want to playmelee range bit later so I ain't at least that's also had that up to what has worked in the past for them for the long-range to probate this skill of her later take away and a small star cuts dick needs face itsyoji who would want to play the slower more controlled style and I think after what happened in the first two games and also with how Wiggly has been struggling in the series if it takes a smart choice to take this far awaybut now it's going to be federally yeah of course that's going to be really scary so Clutch Gaming take their time they are going to let the timer tick data such wanted comes into a joke was picked up instantly and there's two more pic for the band faces are both squats but once you get to the clutch Browns it out and is it going to be inside your belly is that going to be available I was banned the first game it was unpicked on band of the second as far as I can recall from Whittier wrote down the question is does flex play along 5 that or they care more about the 8th on yeah you did this Duo is just so insanely good we talked about stunlock is what it is because irelia bring their own because you can stack up from a frost so quickly even get the ultimate vs. layered and on top of that later it's it's very good to be too early it's also great for team fighting laterhe was hoping it would go unban friendly to play it here and this one and I miss seeing his full power Corky and there's quickly the Gangplank wrapped up as well as those pills you take out a lot of much as big fix away yeah and LG is going late came here so it's a question of his pluck Prime at that in some way or do they just put their foot on the gas pedal and try and run over steel Tri problems and both of the first two games have been clutch out playing CLG in early skirmishes so if CLG can also not fight though that's why I don't take the bike while also having scaly Champions like you have to also play that's all you have to do it on the wrif previously they had gone into losing set up there were collected a better preparation and better executed as well make that has been the court issue now is very clearly Champion go that do want to scale up and are going to have your really Thrive when they do get a couple of items with againI'm going to have to be the game plan on the rift as well on my final fantasy channel to give you the entire bottling here is there dropping, and rakan off the table trying to get rid of the Gangplank counter picks and get rid of the most powerful support right now with work on that place would have rights to First yeah that's also a good number of bands towards honey with tea good pretty safely a pick something now unless they actually do want support counter pick a leader Victor is going to be that second that Blake still flexible between those two by the way he has play Top Lane much like the other pathway Mages that plays very aggressively trying to push it I would expect no in a game played matchup it's going to be there relia you know if you can play Hill Lane irelia into Gangplank very easily but you said you had to take 180 disengage pretty cleanly with Molly with the box of the mouth and I was not always coming through so I thought it was going to be a very sore and Ash directions to Alto what biofrost made kids ride on so it isn't very comfortable Champion for him and considering how the first two games 1/4 c o g I'm very happy to see them switch things up so drastically with five new Champions that they haven't played already in the series it's a departure from what had not been working it's a commitment towards scaling solent bottling to Prime play down there once or level six and it is definitely make things up and now we're past 20 seconds we know it could be that fix your top diatomic down CLG must hold the reverse sweep we've seen a lot of those in the LCS plastic an absolutely be done until play a lot better than they had of the first watch has absolutely been the better team as the coach has big hands might just be the final time will have to feed the top wind Victor is a counter flick in a gangplank to My Niggas be really alongside switch1 how to write a strong to onto any time again comes in a few we get to Torquay scenic route to of the bottom Lane CLG try a new look and I hope it's enough and Game 3D LG looking for later they have a good Arrow into a scar der Pol lose a very good scaling VBS for themselves but have not let them get any game early do we go on to the restaurant could be the last time today as much is 220 over counter logic gaming of meteoric rise in the back half of the summer split they brought liquid to 5 they were nearly in the finals but a 302 third-place match is on the rise of her them is CLC up the turn it around back on the rift over they can carry performance here clutch is held so much Swagger throughout this entire Series going very aggressive early on in these games first blood in game one was five men collapsing midlane around 3 minutes early kills bottom Lane in game 2 as well so now that we're in this situation where the team's timers are mismatched Clutch Gaming little bit more power early on them to try and make some plays happen as far away is Russia as well everybody is joining though so tice's here now five-on-five level one Fiskar for Clutch Gaming making that roll up also tries to let me see who called Amber doesn't even have heliport so it's very important he gets back early all right speaking of experience Bose Solo laners in range for that word girl can get to level two frontwave actually first one back roll a quick word to the side lamp standing by I think we were just watching a little Skirmish right there what was going through your head were you worried or did you know that they get the other hand it's always something happen Bar Italia right now because especially after such a dominant gene to two players got to be feeling confident it's just really important to make sure that we don't too much energy and we don't get sloppy so we still need to focus on ourselves and we focus on ourselves we got the w I just got to take some clean play as long as we play well we'll know it when really find a second shot right there at the top leaders trade back and forth aggressively as well a true until I get over here almost lands that Barrel chain with these pcog take us to damage a lot of These Wings Are bot Lane 612 in the early Huxtable pretty good for Vulcans yes what is top-line Victor 2 is going area so he's looking for constant harassment actually wants to try and you'll get that lead over ruin I actually thought he might go klepto Midland junglers get caught here Demonte is in the position where he still has one corrupting charge it is actually calling Lira into the jungle pretty quick headed for top link on a half Health Gateway pretty clothes are inside a way out who is going to find the help in the first place come through to Lira wave got frozen in exactly the right spot yet another isolated death for ruin leader in isolated death so that is where clutch can look to punish in this game in to speak to your point Kobe about the Victor with Arie he's gone are Esports in that store so he is not picking his picture to scale this picture and it makes complete sense because if you see the Champion Select you cannot go late going up topside for a possible to be too but it is a triple stacked minion wave there that is basically 50% of another Champions damage if they went into that fight damage down here Slowpoke if you have to shock in but still takes quite a few shots in the way out is the total assets under turret right now looks to be a pharmacy to 6 a.m. by Foster the corner does not Jeff Theory Wellness do you want to have walk-ins taking low enough and doesn't have any potions left that he won't really be able to make any aggressive play in this Lane so it's kind of Cody sun and Vulcan trying to just get as much CS as possible while crossing the river with me at least get to the shuttles from self caps for Lear all this effort was better than the toppling to go well you can see the gold differently 300s by the first Blood a lot of his farm yeah Wiggly committing to the Starner play style Farm up very quickly in the early game Emax get 6 and then start making stuff happen so we were knows that all too well that's why he's been very active early Lucid this thing that you do they can do with thresh allows you to be extremely safe even went teleport coming back in bile goes Super far back in the lane and get the landing plate as well they move ruined towards mid saying that he couldn't handle the victory match of the Corky I think of a slightly better against the Victor but now that also makes power of evil a potential game Target up top and also I mean I said one in a really a combination approaching level 6 for Devante if you put Gangplank there in the mid lane you can even still be attacked in the mid lane which is considered the safer length much shorter they're getting another swap app and look at the mini-map right now we set up topside and who do you went mid so ruins going to follow does not want anything to do with this area sports Victor smart play going to get yourself a bunch of farm as possible right now 2018 differently the swaps rolling to the team initiating the swaps because Demonte got to push that waive into Power then I just can't take once again it's supposed to wave first but who has the river control is there running up and down so often lyrics knows there's three people here they might think about this three B tree because your mate is 6 and they are the team that wants the early fights are they taking places have to level six it's just everything there we would be able to flash out just before the ultimate came through from a rail yet then he also does not hit the w tag doesn't get another cubes to finish off the heel on skarner that's quite like Yeti course. They get drawn into a number one or two left and I think that is a missed opportunity for collecting and they had level 6 on both of their soul before Co she had relevant ultimate they didn't have gp6 and Corgi level 6 doesn't matter that much before he's been able to save up missile so the fact that sealed beef got out of that without suffering any gameplay still is 800 gold Eclipse Gaming's leave the bottling still 70s apart and after with vulkan running over from earlier on really funny couple killed but couldn't quite see what they're bringing his class in the process I want to I want to ride back towards the bottom half of the map because there is predator now available for weekly and he could go help this bottom Lane fix it in a Flash list lights out play from ruin their actually in a whole wave given up by Rooney to try and go for that kill not to mention this is one of ultimate so they will not be able to use that body weight in your package came ashore too and you're going to knock him down there right Away Great kill for CLT that's huge Force EOD power vehicle gets the package kill that's good have fun Trinity Force for Corky as soon as he gets that they will be off the ground Wiggly also going to take the opportunity since they
