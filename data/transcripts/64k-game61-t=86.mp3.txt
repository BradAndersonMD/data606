yeah we were taking a look at it you know I love the fast for these players or Tuesday in the ranks as one of his not be worse later in Academy later so how he will stand up the power of evil has a really big question for me and then also he'll have to go up against this key if he stays in the lineup so you know you're putting perhaps of the weakest lehner in Academy up against two of the best in the ALCS in and you expect that to be a bit of a recipe for disaster but that being said no he does have the inbuilt Synergy and practice with fraga's jungle mid is incredibly important they are to maybe they are just looking more to maintain that and feel bad as more important also has to be said just like the fact that pole vaulter hasn't performed pretty well overall in the Asia and they're not winning with him so I respect taking the shot at a bit of a Hail Mary here say hey we're expecting a loose anyway let's change something up let's see if we can inject a little excitement into the roster and I'm sure they're there their down in the dumps a bit do you bring in some Academy playersbring it to New energy you see if you can pick something up gravel win as cure playoffs and it will say if my recollection is proper that since Immortals have lost the worst sealed you can do is a tiebreaker at 5 and Tina cross the board's I believe they're one and one against both those things are girls who shouldn't be anything but that if it feels when you come through so obviously you win here today or you in tomorrow for you when your tie breaker and see make it into playoffs Anderson what was making sure that we have the right Rasta to go but the best I can tell their fate is in their own hands for Sylvia Michael stupid habit of course they can get second they can get 3rd I will see what goes on for them it's going to be the early set pick up a very high price here in Pro play it has to be answered at a little Bantu when I'm really excited about and kind of frame for honestly is that Frank is because I was by it because it has been a really good for him in Academy that he had played it quite a lot news for plays 75% win rate it has been isbest performing Champion so that would be really exciting to that come into the ALCS with the set being picked up it doesn't fully eliminate the chance of that is this obviously could be still pop lane or midline we have been seeing a lot of those types of things make sense to to bring a different book right in the LCS so if you're trying to go for the for the upset play something that people are are less used to or less comfortable and buy a ticket to upset when I think if you do anything if you pick the set to grab the flex going into set is now less flexible it's only mid top jungle and I haven't seen ruin play set all split lawn mower have we really seeing Tuesday pics that one up so there's a chance to just simply goes to practice as his second most played of display regardless we'll see what comes down as Pee-Wee gets the law can be found a paper flight before the second round of band and one problem I do have with grabbing dinner Levi is that you could we play Pandora Top tentor even a Morgana and the old gets real use those real fast they'd be kind of place over these there's a little bit of a chance but I would love to see you order anything like that I don't think that they need to First Take it or it's going to take it away or whatever by the way you look at it when they played against a thousand times since Christmas this year is Dubai right so you know if I fly Quest eliminate that variable take away the vibe deny that opportunity for them to have to come mix things up but I think more than likely it probably is just set going to practice anyway we're not going to get that that excitement of the five pick because you said room hasn't played it Tuesday haven't played it in Academy so it's possible that I am expecting you to go to the jungle for now they are looking toward this part as real lame you're not not one of the strongest Laney do especially when you're up against the ass because there is the ability for it for things to be a bit rough downthe band of the reconnaissance very much ain't worth ignore who it is mostly by far he has been very effective climbing in different angles and flying with this but they can still go towards in his cancer support and I'm probably just slam this Lane and 6 a.m. and smoothie have been no one of the week is laners playing Duos in the ALCS so I think that's the only that that flag what could look who exploit lcog weakling is across-the-board really I'm looking over it with dragon tattoos different doing an academy they are down gold frequently and it's like to be the bad team they are fifth place at I think they end up night at 9 but they were eight eight with this roster like for Tuesday in that roster like they were an acceptable Academy team but they still have an early day and evening Academy is coming through Rumble by the way a flex pick between Rouen and Tuesday so that is beautiful double duty it does mean that syndra is up as a possibility or the winterwhat's the best type of spider. Ignore is exciting player he's a good engage player he's always doing the damn it not lesbian type is really really fun to watch this is not really for that that lady Duo I don't think I may be po16 definitely have to try to go to kill there at the blind tenant feels like that can be very punchable here know by solo we have seen can enlarged fairly ineffective throughout the LCS a soloist someone who does feel very comfortable going to a lot of the tanks you didn't even bring out the maokai I think that that is an option that they could be in a very strong for flyquest you can obviously go for some deranged mashups and I should just go right at the tenant to but it's going to be double AP cylinders overall early Magic Image heavy because you're expecting snow set to be tank then you have the double AP so later than Ezra with some mix damage Bart pretty much all magic damagealrighty well the roster has been locked in nothing surprising gear the vice sadly not going to be on the table it is set jungle as somewhat expected to come to the top so it'll be answered by mordekaiser which I like a lot in any given team fight one of the ways you can lose is a big cannons like a central team until it goes not to argue with me I'm the only getting done by 2:24 before I really really do like the mordekaiser as a duelist but as a team by team but I think it's a cool underwear with some good really do good wanders into flight cuz I also think that you can kind of do the same thing with whatever but you anyway we'll see how it goes I don't think that you know this is a match up at that should be that bad for solo but I do expect Canon to to have the run of the lane at least early on as long as you're actually eat a dodging out a lot of those goats Rats from from the ward in the grass beenI do think I have a pretty good time but overall a you know steals yet I think it is going to have to show something pretty special because he that they are a heavy underdogs here and there's good scaling over on the other side and I think flyquest have positioned themselves well too, play their style this is power of evil in his comfort zone playing a stealing Mage other as Frontline there is a gauge that is really everything that that's like us would need to play Yo very comfortable macro Style game and it's going to be up to see LG AI thinq to disrupt that yeah right is is CLG have to and realistically three games left to play in the regular season they're going to fight flyquest they're going to fight Cloud 9 I'm expecting them to lose both and that means they are almost certainly destined for a tiebreaker with dignitas and maybe Immortals and and they've got to figure out by that point in time with the best running 5 is what you know the strategy to be what the pigs need to be so they can get that last spot in plastic is only one spot left up for grabs and right now Dig InnCLG have five wins fighting for and they're going to battle later on he knows it to do it most likely I think we're selling them ever so slightly shorter these were already saying they're very good team but looking at the schedule I expect them to take to you some spot at third because he gets in fight with anybody right now it's like you know 12 and 6 and takes their see automatically it's okay here we go we're going to go fight niji down in the basement and clothes without the possibility that looks like regardless I do want to see how good likeness liquido the upper bracket we know there was a very slim chance to get the playoff bye and I don't want to see them tuned up and ready to go as a playoff threat they've also be some really good teams lately and a half I'll be at didn't have a great weekend to nail this weekend are they beat TL they btsm they have taken down some the very strong opponents they did lose to see Nye but that's their only loss of last six games and they are156 on a four-game winning streak they are shaping up in a right in the nick of time I think we're and I think rightfully so has been getting a lot of credit that he has been really intelligent about how he's actually playing out of these games how he's acting like he's able to find you a lot of really unique tank pads and angles at timings at players are not expecting that it's kind of really throwing them off so we'll see how far I get to deal with that Tuesday going to have the trip Bard health pack there from smoothie so Tuesday can have the advantage of not only that. The ocean but essentially an extra help ocean and a half or so of feeling that it's about 225 with that level one fence that they don't Stock Yards you taking stuff but I was quite a lot extra of help for that walk set start not a big shock right there, going to look like a camp that you do with machete trundle red to blue to grab to whatever else right now about pressureflyquest respect the fact that you spell right now we put the PAC Center mid you could only ever have three so until Tuesday Isom you literally couldn't read W because then why'd you put them down to the first place so that's okay like a push down Tuesday office early aggression whatever could help back pain so in any sort of like even trade even take his is on his way of winning trade that's kind of how you get the most use out of this hell facts and also to your point you can if you place until they have started to be taken down that bot Lane so you're taking the Trade Center get use out of them now allows about Landon and having blue to be too also very severe Terrace on that trade you know all the money's going one way so Tuesday off literally could start right there ruin pushing in Solo I don't imagine the only one looks that good I feel like Canon has a pretty easy time dodging do the backwards cloth the attack trained to chew on it pretty well you can Auto them backI'll just pack up and knock it pulled either so far so good foot again I don't really listen to I don't and it's just completely ruined once you get there and I'll talk to the possibility but I still like to get there I do think that you know you should be fine but you shouldn't get absolutely blown out in especially if you're if you're worried about that as solo you can go fairly expensive Bruins obviously it's Shield going to resolve secondary and he actually has Suites on 2nd wins does that is really the like I don't want to lose vs. range setup Doran Shield plus second wind is more than enough usually to keep you pretty healthy so unless you get sad over something I don't expect this to get out of control but brightness is passing up here I don't think they can even look for it though and be able to be at a pressure bandage but they even a shin farm and go from therestains out of his class and that is a nice Real Madrid Lane ignite down but they do get that flash unfortunate inform got hit by that same stuff done as ignore actually pillard in Tuesday immediately after the flash I think that is a kill to credit for Tuesday for a really well placed knock back there and solo Linea a couple of Bowls does being ruined his is getting the worst trade analyzer slat is going to get like to give him a free free push it's really just all about actually dodging the cloud when was guaranteed the timing is such that the cop pulls you in and the key was bumper and it will always land on you if you really have to avoid that one still more than anything else on the bottom side while not quite a few nice try to really try those other it through Atlanta on one Castor plant behind for the living well enough not the end of the day it's going to be pretty easy for himso this is a very atypical you almost always will see the chilling Smite Intuit davanni has very aggressive to me this is because you're clear is going to be much worse when you're actually having a very late dinner hold your overall team fighting is going to be a lot weaker it's kind of somewhat similar in that means not a one-to-one comparison but we just have a lot of lease and there was like the movies Russell East Side games where it's like you're investing into moose means you can be everywhere so you can be more effective when the Gangsta and really get something done and to me it if ragus can't make anything happen before punches Kenny out for the Blast code that's not too bad I can't get all the way over the wall but he's still invisible talk to the runaway no problem there send torrents cuz if it's worth of plastic brackets did so through the scuffle there they do get the flash off of ignar to so it is a bit of a trade overallsafe no Seraph lackluster pretty happy with that no getting that flash off for I guess if you're the best in the early fifties just need to learn is going to be way ahead on the jungle item completion self-effacing to track that going for it you're done here for six days he is down in laying he hasn't used to teleport yet though so we'll see if they can find any sort of a window to it's a really kind of an advantage or or claw back here in this to be too with that teleport very very tight game between these two squads bought laying into in support so very tight one right now about Drake the slowest of Drake's to kill the lowest threats as well and with machete has okay damage and a shows up they are going to knock his grace back right now for the eagle in the early games so far is sent or it going to take I said it's also track
