why don't you pick something on the right side and I'm just so curious about spring that go to snow much Invictus gaming in Spring they said they have site selection and game on Beto's red side so far in group stayed undefeated on the red side as well that means the shy less likely to get one of those big counterpick to really blow sort out of the waterediting thing that the JCPenney here that was its pies para swords most played Champions certainly a great this I staple as well but you are hurting I can't deal with this and that that's fascinating be other bottomland if they're keeping open know would be Guerin you me and when we were watching the Shona tahm kench vs. Garen Yumi Griffin versus Cloud9 game I was fairly convinced that the Stono would technically be accounted for that but that's sort of an actually to me says Griffin might be willing to go Gary Union game on this is what kind of what I was thinking maybe the one V one I think Kobe rookie and Anna but regardless they haven't already put that can get itthey were playing last night in other, but I've already been very down at Worlds recently especially in the outside possibility there's more to this Lulu pick than first meets the eye another things that some teams have done against Karen Huger which now has confirmed with locked-in is picking more of a hyper carry bottom of do I can see them trying to pair up an Ardent censer Lulu with either of Bane or kog'maw or at even a twitch or something that could be very powerful later in the game and Korea vein was definitely play The Lacsbut to be fair if caixa is up above all other every single one not if he's in the game is the number one scariest camp for us we are removing that everything else is fine or later here I do have one final thing I do remember is Draven idalia a different style of champion from the van when it comes to what is against Draven but it is notable that is ultra Comfort is left open and this is also because you're probably going to be a Kianna mid-length rookie in the group and even though the block is Bandit does Lee Griffin open for potentially a last pick counter for Midlandokay Griffin are going to leave made up for Last Frontier flight restored it was looking around that I get the play part of your so far at all world going to play are we should have already talked to you a bit of a safer Champion overall I think this guy is a stronger top later and play something. What are you up to I can't be Pueblo. Matchups are less than the Price Chopper on to the roster as Todd comes and talks irrelevant a time that's a historic match up with the ability to see if I can find some other for a long time all right yeah watching Griffin try and find fight in Chuck Rodriguez Lulu Kiana Aldi's all of its threat in front of them and safely well the new Champion out of the rest of the Crock-Pot in the bottom Lane meanwhile welcome to summoner's Rift per game 1 of the quarterfinals Invictus gaming are defending their world championship against one of the best teams has her has ever received the number to Maria play so well to get the top seed here they drew IG and multiple expect three wins this one and went at top speed they chose the red side and have definitely gone down the counter picking rabbit hole but are there is about here is the to get the counter picks in the lane matchups they want they have sacrificed traditional damage when you think of what a mid to late game team fight looks like for the poppy in the middle and I'm liable for damage might be the highest and then no one else really trailing her so because of that it feels like the only Dominican execution with was on point from Griffin a few days ago it's all going to have to be really closely inspect I think so and also when were looking across counter picks there's a lot of very interesting stuff happening so I feel like the general team comp by Griffin counters Kiana because there's not a good Target for Kiana to actually find any type of assassination on normally it's get your lasala go to go to hit a squishy Target Dory squishy Target actually don't exist you mean on targetable and Elise can also Josh things with repel so there should be no one but rookie can find assassinations on you on the flip side you have a bunch of people with high MaxHealth the kog'maw with lethal Tempo will be able to stretch through throughout the game show hitting the proper time Windows is going to be very important I do all this shouldn't be no surprise when call Moe's in the game it really is does Griffin Trivia Live cam Osteen buy them back at the start of a fight or discount mall do right now really pushed into the bottom Lane were looking to the mid laners some Farm is a rookie so far doing pretty well on CS might have to drop to the cast of Indians on the trail put so far so good over there and then got a pretty heavy leash on the blue buff there did the full left side clear make his way down to the bottom of jungle at least one very similar things in the north jungle Atlanta map here already Vision missions done by gryffin to open things up topside stop by at least not necessarily anticipating some outside to make sure that we can't get punished super early on into the game since yeah they are just going to be pushed in early be interested to see if you try to do anything Reddit actually going to be very difficult to gain show he has no reason to ever use his W preemptively in can just really wait for broadcast to go in and if they ever try and get him when she Asian I think you just rock is Aftershock that way and become very tank should be fairly comfortable pushing up and laying here it was about two guys because he is but he's a little bit jumped in. Granite so there is some degree of trade and going on for the actively there and I was about to Scuttle comes over to dig when I can have much aggression dungeon the bottom side Elites Renekton in this lollipop video. Going to see in the middle and very much for the Sun hits if you stand next to a wall at the least it's a coon the follow-up is insane and Poppy does have a lot of face first damage if she's planning her full rotations I think that's kind of 8 that have potentially road with its walls up you're not going to get you in that so sickly walks backwards should have seen the mid laner come in as well to there where that timing thing could go back in the late is he I believe he was recalling on the war with his I'm really game cuz he doesn't have anything up on the map reasonably right now to do his plugs will be up shortly so until then he's actually just going to kind of hang up hang out up here and interesting how we actually misses the sweep even though it was fairly obvious they walked over toward if I have some stats hear from that for games at Griffin played last week on a second round robin the kill death ratio on the right side is so impressive a 7.3 Kilts for every death incurred I went and looked at that I actually asked has there ever been a better day of best of one play than what we saw from Griffin earlier this time that the answer was actually know it was probably the most impressive statistical and I test all time Griffin would be ranked third if you noticed the two teams above them did end up winning a world championship so kill death ratio is by no means the be-all-and-end-all of who will win world but Griffin group stage in contact with very impressive Now take me back to the topside Tarzan has continued to stay up here as the replicant has come back up hoping to find something on the side has been playing for the aggressively filters very large Siesta lead on the Oswell that's the kind of paper looking for I can't come up here at least have to get the farm on a lot of containment done by gryffin so far but the game really does pivot when Boots of Mobility a done it wasn't no snowball kill and we know that's very likely on the way if they can keep River control on both sides here then we won't see a return to form of rookie who was really dumb it in the silence against TL so effortlessly and I also have to say that the bottom Lane of is it necessarily expected to win early there expected to then turn on kind of want unique guest rewards this early game is going to be about Griffin stopping the bleeding as much as possible and they're not necessarily doing that very well in the Top Lane and it'll be very fun to track how powerful jackeylove get in what is essentially a fairly easy length Deport the board down there spotting once again Toby using such as presents to consider the trades with rookie grounds him for then after shock make that all happened a couple times we've come this Lane and seeing those abilities used in the one on one that means you can't stop the bodies have anymore so it's certainly important within the track and has Nick is closer to 60 than farming well right he's already got more than 10 camps done and then without ultimate can certainly try to force the kill seeing the trades continue hearing Federal Pest Control wad but side does stop any early infantile stop from Griffin pretty decently would have Donald Drake and obviously as a team that has a pretty low damage profile later you want any person of all you can get right now so far to set up north are and if we think about the overall pace of this game even though there's a 500 goalie for IG I would say this is much more of a griffin Style game been denied each other in terms of debt every split Griffin is played in the lck they've had the fewest guess in the lck they are a low error League of Legends team Invictus gaming despite making it to world had the most deaths in the LPL summer split they are a very high error team that is willing to take risk and often times without play you through more good place that overpower the bad so I had this conversation earlier this week what would like the combined kills per minute break point ATP for IG to win versus for Griffin to win and we think it ends up having to be very high just because of the way Griffin is used to playing so this is very much a griffin paste game which despite the goal we do it after the aunt makes you think you're in a decent position maybe just give them something resembling a failing drop on the first day of wild going for the on and going for a lot of late game scaling in this sort of a game we can't just give the past month based on his dark performance with kind of flow pill games we do have to look at IGN say okay if I take a lot of punch and I
