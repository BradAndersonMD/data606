you're missing from the previous when I bought individually 40 was completely fine as a player and flesh will take a step up now today and I topped ashelawn Squad here in the ALCS irelia top of table very very very fast the band also coming through as well the fact that but I think they may have predicted some of us trying to do but Rumble Jason one final band going to be a rise in a C9 side and now clutch what really the first pick on Silas is up to keep mine so is a collie two other important picked out there as well alright I'll start at Eric has been left open and they actually are allowing such a kind of be the dare you know to break it if you put in your kind of stuck with Sona without a against the Tariff and a collie trading hands and seconds in on the second an interesting matchup with stylus 2 Coastal me different ways that are a lot of different changes you can make with in the match of as far as the Conqueror in the bill that you go Silas definitely has his windows with their later in the game versus the college alright well I'm going to be up directly one-on-one we'll see what they all go if you like any of those players can play those Champions hack trim Nico Kenan all Band Away fanfic lemon gaming what does being on one Accord Cecilia Stoll in a crab for either side and the jongleur here as well as been one jungle bana to top lamp and 59 second 12in followed up here they just like the acronym makes so much sense with the donut Eric the super already gauge damage juggler Kindred also can make a lot of sense with the Deep by composition it's in a much different ways not your heart engaged so you have to get that from somewhere else and they're just kind of taking off another one of those high damage done that has another ultimate that can save this also Kindred vs Rex I tended to be a bit Kindred save it if I understand correctly which means that opens up and grabs right away by coming in as well as a solo Lane Pike right now so getting there in Fraser from Wonder Over in G2 cuz I wine yes it is okay go I mean it's flexible you can play it as well as cute but I definitely expect it to go in the hand of the Jungle also pretty cool fun free I thought this was a really interesting last pic to me the ultimate that ultimatum so good at actually getting the kills on a pike the hardest thing with pipe it's blocking and dad is still slippery has all this disengage can't get into the deep Waters and go invisible but Camille is one of those Champions that is so good at all in a pipe the Top Lane is going to be a battle who need liquor is it was one of our Premier Top Lane matchup yeah and they are going to go take it to 11 this is exciting because ya booty again essentially why did the pike it was indeed a Liquors getting last pick for top-end says okay you're playing top-flight probably kamila's my business spicy absolutely junglers that can make early passes there recti definitely has the advantage they screwed up one of you enjoy doing with Ali thin but it is going to be about how they coordinate and track the enemy jungler to get those times. is it going to be all kinds of fun to watch for here is going to be an electrocute for The Stylist to conquer for the akkala look at it ruins we put ourselves of this one the second game of this new gaming roster with Cody sand on the bottom light they have Titans ahead and go in Cloud 9 and now we got C9 themselves over the key turn off the LCS summer split Ping's already going down 69 jungle here looks like clutch might go for an invade see it looks like it's hot outside Alcor Spike can be very good level one that can you can be pretty nuts Oconee Flash and there's maybe just enough follow up with work on going on the war that they expect to be there but the rest of Clutch Gaming will catch licorice unawares licorice good spot right now and he will walk away know someone is burned Lil Bit of damage dealt but now it means that drunk control goes to Clutch Gaming side to put a water the red. Well you always should be responding on the opposite side of the invade as soon as you see that you can see the move into your from C9 you react instantly go in and get cancer Wards on the enemy jungle so both sides to have those before it's on the Red Bus I do really like those of a want it shows that it's in preparation they know where Liquors likes to sit at level 1 to even had Lehrer show on a war that they knows the end foots down I love that kind of love 1 preparation is sadly doesn't mean a whole lot of enforcing your pudding to learn hookshot which is probably but they get that anyway and now we have the battle starting with a blue buff fuel for collecting stuff very aggressive looking from Clutch Gaming going for the NBA taking away this blue looks like some? Things are trying to split them a pure give up their phone Bluetooth to the East Side lyrics and they continue to farm out this guy's going to be already at the thing you have to watch out for always as early on Farrakhan definitely extremely potent and they're using that to their advantage so far as soon as Lira shows on this Ward on the red box that will alert fence Karen that he is gone from his own side Passover Zone Ward here just continue clearing route answer right now if it was perfect information about these sides do if you want the top side fighting I could do more damage been in here but clutch knows that spend went red deck rugs down the Raptors and kind of the camps that Leroy had as well as pretty as I surmised that was blue bromp onto fat red buff so and now is a run through the fog of War we probably have some guessing if games against the jungle sides we were taking actually a lot of farm you're doing the Raptors as well not going for his own bluebuff though I could have gone through fog of War I believe that is a ward in the river put down by the mate so that would have been done if it happens if it okay to drink if I'd have nothing for almost nothing take away yeah he's going to lose out on his back to fight him rather than going for the reverse clear though and that is going to be the first objective and though they're both trying to lose them right now in mid being pushed out by Demonte means it's pretty easy to own the bottom River you could see Cody spend the bulk of doing the same so there is exactly one campus events during can take you out of jungle Camp Lunchables with that yeah we should see where I just crossed straight across mid lane and grab the other stomach wraps answering his Midland is also put stuff right now though it looks like the desync Top Lane is going to be the bigger tell licorice is moving over to make sure there's something Force been scared to take washable wool does nisky flexible Chase q auto could be out to kill him that he should have flashed cloud901 already worried but still on cloud nine with first one to Cody sun and 1/2 minutes in and everybody is partying down on the red bumps side of the Jungle of fudge gaming except for who needs the bike is pushing on topside he will get a turret place as well as which of us a minion into that turret another look at this replay here they changing jobs Amante licorice had come in and called it off but as soon as they see the bottom line also move up do you see on the mini-map Liquors also starts to convert that to mean that eventually Cloud 9 what has more numbers cuz they have everybody down on the bottom half of the map so much damage do by police on here trying to take them off but this is able to cut him out long enough for the arrival of the C920 Wheatley turn the tables to get the extra feel alright so this means we have a 300 gold lead to Cloud 9 but no control here honey holes in the crab and Leo grabs the shuttle now as well who need us at least still down in farm is licorice comes back up top went after the recall after reading c p and has more items and more CS how many will be on the back but somewhat here is licorice at the shop at least it's going to go to the kill a wild snake that hard to keep alive but see you not not terribly far away from the bike is trades aren't you doing in tailbone putting drops off at some pretty good damage that all the damage up what we talked about earlier the hextech ultimatum so good for Camille here in the one-v-one with bike definitely has a huge Advantage so who you going to have to be very careful and now that there's a lot of extra money on the Camille as well as the approaching level six you can just give them play very far back right now is being pushed around by Demonte a bit and has that assist to his name I am roughly equal across those players into that thing under 4 without too much difficulty and now we have left gaming again more pressure in this bottle a in and look at the farm different just 45 on this diet to 19 on Eric that this is more than double plus the mountain breaks up the first what Cody sun has put gaming are alright slaughtering the bottling to onto it is not closed right now really well don't actually going to get a little bit behind but not this much behind and Lane versus is diarrhea console really aggressive looked also the room up into the jungle was while they were more minions killing off their opinion so a lot or deny there and that is going to be a fairly big gold sink here and what are the reasons why the gold is still so close to even seen I got the extra show I only can see you as they pass once again by each other than bit later still a bit close with the Mazda is winning in form of Ralts actually largely a several Lane lead the jungles up in farm didn't quite well it's actually really only licorice about who needs for his laning phase leads here you can see the gold despite the extra kill has now down to an only child afraid of back and forth but you know it it's it's pretty close your overall as a game and let's give me I think so far being somewhat impressed if you came into the split you would maybe not expecting to do well against C9 but this game pretty well so far back as well before be to there are no rules of the P90 second plate falster play going to drop now as well and how far back to have to play threatened by the time that is completely split map right now Cloud 9 weeks I down on the bottom meanwhile top cyclists Gaming's weak-side there who needs having to defend against all the looks from Licorice and Spence Karen roaming around big big Cash & Go on the plate on the bottom side for Clutch Gaming very nice PowerPlay there to push in and get some gold out of disadvantaged can't right now 900 gold above sneaky not a completely Fair direct comparison but still factually accurate 900 also up above the Derrick which is the one for one right now in this point in the game until she can complete that and now liquor to retain most that back up a liquor still does going to head to know Straits got licorice has command of the topside you so about 300 go to wave or a head from the kill that he got on the bottom half of the map and as you can see trade goes pretty close to even as the potion and passive from Pikeville can heal uni back up and just find a flat fee of liquor stores in but pretty easy to do in the back of the beach too much of a difficulties and even though you don't like you in a bit of Mana make sure the minions all go down spent staring now lurking around. Looking forward to keep this one in the fog of war paint. Tulira offer Supply in a bottle closest down in Plymouth from the beer in the depth of the damage the ultimate that's the weirdest looking for place not going to get any kills in a 1405 out of the top side looks really good there is playing out their strength Racine I try to focus on the top that did you get the two V2 Advantage Missy rooms up there but it's too late and that gives Tomas an opening to go for clutch Gaming's advantageous side of the map again passing on bottom this will be the turret order a kill going to go over the Clutch Gaming as well as every single plate light number four and a 10-minute birds for a glass Lane is working wonders of the roster change this and maybe clutch turn their faith around with this player upgrade is another look at that I was going to get a ping on Lyra from the past of wear recti give me daily goes in guess the doc up stopping him halfway through as a hectic ultimatums game from Licorice and you did real flash out of booty full commitment but you can't ultimate no big difference there by consummate get / do execution ultimate gets the kill on their Tower
