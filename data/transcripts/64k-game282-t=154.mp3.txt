back to being scary and we've had Lira BB all LCS jungler piglet been the best 80 carrying the war before who needs but it has not been West before like these are all players they can get back that level all able to do so at the same time they would be fearsome indeed recipe more about who is mechanically but it has been decision-making I think more than the individual abilities that is often question even when he puts himself in a good position some nights over-reaching feeling like you need to make something happen far superior to your party is going to be easily funny this will be the fourth difference between line up here for optic gaming vs. With the against would have intended or LCS whatever bottom line of Arrow and big together I want to see how competitive this side of the roster look Ciara's in the crown has been the one player to start every single game for optic so far this year and get another time and it isis Darla Kitten video seven rdr2 thoroughly different jungler start-off people look at as this guy who's really really aggressive who is more A hot or cold where is media is kind of more of the guy who's going to play for consistency he's going to try play for Farm Play Around Mission Control is injected then and all of that sort of style so we'll see if having garlic in the line up here and get things going for them as I did think the crown book better in the first 2 weeks along side door. So that it's really one area it's not like things were working as a hundred percent spread across this entire year and for this past it's been a hundred percent battery we almost threw up earlier pick up a k i want to play more Majors I want to go in and play my photos not off meta style but but still a little bit unorthodox or noon their first going to be there right away and a j switch can't beat Area North America pop game certainly are expecting Lutheran bomb to be the bot Lane do I will do as you say it has been Far and Away considered the number one mark then I may have a bit of a plane of their own and how to answer at the fresh to come out we'll see if the Jason wanted to go bought or something along those lines to try to match power for power down on the bottom side but that's the other thing with splotches they had you have some guys who are really kind of known for their real estate was amazing from Vulcan baby huge place yesterday Casio is Goonies best champion in my opinion you guys are so good at and that is going to leave some of the generic power picked up as well as I am curious who is going to play the engagement who's going to play the front line onI think of their players I think it's a Monster High astranova he's usually gone the champagne look at all of your LeBlanc whatever but he's was on the galio so I don't discount him entirely but I don't feel like who needs a great Malachi and Vulcans on Bromley public defenses of the tanks here so who's going to start the flights to let clutch getting play hyper agarose a question I have asked a few days did actually involve a lot of Tanks play and there are still certainly play making tanks pictures of coffee right and I think things like that babe morphe it is styled I was I am back yesterday playing something that was fine we can go this kind of tank PVP builds and I think you can build a similar role but we'll see who is going to fill that role in know it looks to me like much is trying to fade out a Scion pick from dhokla I maybe know when you do see that there is a double top of them bands like that and sign is going to continuously off the band page but it could just be that Jason's going shopping and so is midazolamthey're already decided we have to wait and see if it's going to be flexed around. I can pick her jungler is singing this next round and simply wait to flex that Jade between arrow and do close to Rolesville going to go for here there's the Astro van is waiting to see cuz I think clearly have the makings of a pokestop hero session bring you out Jason Zoe all to get along great folk so as real cannot round that out here so he said it will be here right away I don't need to rush this one because I think it's worthwhile to pretend Jace might not go Top Lane and just give Hoon easy guarantee counterfeit it is it is weird and what you are doing that but the reason that I definitely think there is for a pic like this in his order it simply using OK daughter has a very not there to pick where you had to pick that is contingent on what else the other team is going to play okay if you were supposed to fix them in Durango rightknowing you are looking at it like that but it does give up the idea of having any potential counterpick on the other side and in a situation where if you pick red side of your existence are you get no counterpick and you're special Jungle Book doesn't get to come out while then you just had to drop this today that you exactly it is pretty well and I do like what's the most engaged and we already know. I feel like now is dark does not bring out some sort of Magic images jumper than malphite has such a good time up in the Top Lane because you're if you're itemizing again if you want to Stack Armour Academyhardest counter picks possible in the Vladimir about coming out there really really smart booty clearly by okay well now it's for sure the J so I do think that they were able that I really outsmart them blasting again at another time cuz now not only do you have a physical damage juggler as well as the magic damage your booty is going to have to be in this is such a miserable match of this is really truly one of the worst magic tickets play it feels like in Top Lane at least do for a kaolin I can be very very tough to deal with the vitamere who could you to do things like that do Vladimir and sit there and farm off you can rescue very easily under the turret you become pretty dependent on Jungle assistance innocturnes not exactly the guy to get up there and really punishing Vladimir in the early but we'll see if I can turn around somehow Clutch Gaming a very very bad matchup in the top lyrics jungle Jase when he played a couple weeks ago himself and this one is optic gaming AR-15 parts do happen that can be scary they can get pushed through Lucian Mike to have a field day mouth light has a lot of good targets are all things be concerned about as we load into the game as optic try to find a light app that works there was a way from being tied for playoff position and Clutch Gaming are those exact same shoes even the bottom of table have a Fighting Chance of the LCS here to pick up a winvery stink bombs I do think that clutch has a much more straightforward and easy to run cough mouth boy prices are knock their prices are you go forward 15 fight where is on the side of a Zoe and Jace has to be poking and in trying to whittle people down and then maybe there comes to follow up where do Cole and tries to get a flakka and hard engage with the bladimir himself and try to do something like that but as far as straight up by B5 both you smashing into each other you really have to pay plush might be the case but we have an inside word we've got at word withpoutine on the sidelines for what do you think about this game is going to look like things guys can we see that you stopped in. Off for media's today what was the decision behind that lot of different options for the team in draft and engaging in two functions of Jays play today so I feel is just a different set of options and I think that it would be easier for us to use a different selection sports day is this game and this is something maybe we can see it more in the future or excited to see you back to you guysfelt different options the reason I bring this one end and certainly I would say the biggest Edge Optics you have ours that Flex pic with Vladimir into a very free Match app where you could maybe take over the game dhokla back when he played in academy I had just absolutely absurd Lee good laning phase Terry stats high damage share and feels like high damage is going to need you the name of the game here in this one and I'll fight with no tanks versus hard engage he did actually a little bit but then our customers card code on the first wave it's not really possible to make you late much to do here is it make sure this way but not frozen on him you'd rather be kind of thinking it's in a safe area and he's hoping that this means he's not exposed to any pencil. We know that butTony obviously does not and we will let you know as soon as we find out what this pause is going to be but certainly some very interesting match-up you're across the board as you stay Lucien has not gone through all this patch in the ALCS so first time Lucian is going to be able to come out malphite we did see as an answer actually from solo I do believe into the dates match up to who tried to recreate the magically had their butt often has had a very clever draft really clever is just a matter of it working out in the end it's just it's going to be I feel like the name of the game we're going to bring this game is there are compositional elements on a v e v level that favor one side and cons of elements on a One V one side that really favor the other like the lighter malphite is going to be a few wedge in this game that the game people eat tilt over however it's not consider mouth virus no tanksomeone's going to die when those are buttons are pressed in and it's well if malphite can just be stuck in the filing because do flies pressure interest constantly and enjoy quotes about pressure that you can't just give this away then I'll take him because he's depending stressful time, where's the new away for a Syma Neko Chan I think that is something that we're kind of seen you that you're worth currently Lee McIntosh said was really happy we prioritize but you would still kind of favorite Lucian Brom in the bottling TV to middling match everything is fairly skilled base so we will see us. I'll keep looking for an early baby but Lyra is going to find him and crowds trying to put this in so early flight for Dominic means it's too easy to take over that Day crafts for the Restless phones get taken and pay most of the gold goes to do. But have TX Pecos to Lira and I both last night for it I still can't hate too much they stillmore camps to pick for the Jason the end of it all feels bad to Smite for nothing. But it could have obviously been better for him but just wasn't expecting Lira to be there clearly that is why you generally only want to hear him unless he's really know where the jungler is or there's some kind of Star Trek movie clearing his way back up to the top side and we'll be able to get into Billy Bass on and then we'll decide to be there cuz I think he's expecting him topside take my camps away and it lyrics to The Folk of your left hand side and came down and maybe surprise him either way though it is still more camps for the Jays long-term and it feels pretty good if not urine is delayed to 6 because he only got half his Raptors that's Solid Rock the gaming that's that's the power spike your kind of a lion and because of six more actors going away it has been nice hope your day was good damage one more shot but it's all black byinteresting because Jason's not exactly an early-game ganking jungler either right no Nocturne op time to talk about okay we got to shut this guy down going to make something happen before you text you want to talk to be proactive but it does not really that it is still kind of a Skilling jungler as well as someone who's been wanted her to Villa Smite him she was going to try to look to play around pressure round dektas and and you hope that he does have because Gangstar really not that interested in looking kind of just get behind someonewell so far stiffer three calls coming through both these players. A couple longsword for his efforts and libras Nocturne sitting top 10 cases and kind of tank to be had is text on the ground for the First Response of his jungle the wise far for the course here pretty typical lethal Tempo high damage available to get the warranty one have you decided to do so is much more about the team fight you know it does have a lot of power there but a lot of reason that people love these were matches that you can just complete the farm gold off of the Mal fighting then you get your one two items much much quickly and then try to get to the G fight with that and utilize that as the power of this is a bit of a different style and it's also something where goonies never going to even have a chance of running you down because the only hope I I've ever really seen from outside in the one going to the smash-up is a q-max where you can just run him down but it was FaZe rug should be able to remove the queue slow and you can Simply Thai the house and not really any hope in the one the one you would think for honey but going to recall for an early Catalyst and likely working for the Bissell which I think is it a pretty solid answer I'm going to be decent for him and her little even spam man to get health back so should be able to survive at least somewhat one small chicken chicken away from. Gandhi attempted invaded by the timer about right but it was clear to go Me by Lera though level five is first woman doctor a good job of farming despite losing you know half a camp to invade the earlier and has really good at there any way we can live in the queue as well so I could be able to use down a lot of those camps is fairly quickly at level six. Should be able to get it and then look for his personal gag throwing down here already
