Stihl D needs to be so good at identifying what I could possibly enjoy the power straight at the Champion Select no time to be wasted we've already seen the first couple bands at the band table we'll see if that carbon is to follow soon as we toss it out to the casters for the call thank you very much. In the last spot in the playoff one's going and I have a little bit of inside intelligent for the analyst test all about what will happen if diamond is band I went to register him last night and I made a personal request to please play ap Pravana on page cuz I've been saving it and it's really fun he said no chance at that but he has also been practicing his in Italy okay which previously has played on the LCI stage so there may be a small chance of a pee at jungle Powerhouse a very bad so far thisBattle of fondor so long because across champions league and out by CLG hoping to play some more off metal stuff on both sides all right I also like this Calista echo-fox previously yesterday we saw sdlg have sticks they bring out his Calista once again and he did not die completely different blades Kalisto with bow Frost Brom was definitely a force to be reckoned with and both of these teams did something different with their bottom lights on the echobox died they had a hell of a cock my backed up by a Lulu's that's the bottom line Focus could be incredibly important as well rek'sai the first pick of the day here in again this right here means vs7 a huge deal here and thought and hands of Wiggly is what gives you to place their trust in meanwhile Apollo the back on the Jinx a big champ for him with Rush on Sedgwick Countyyou Show Jinx and said Lonnie early on Friday and you won't that is how you are playing the entire game so we'll see if they can group up and get their communication back on the line what are the things that has been the downfall of every box earlier on and it split were played where they were not on the same page because people running in different directions if you have a 5 on 5 team by you need five people there who is Lonnie stand in front of jinx get your rockets off and press are at somebody meanwhile you've got fresh and likely a kite that year but it's getting bottom side and I like Rushford I think more fits the bill of a heathen land that hook onto Jinx and go into the big tray to be powerful I expect an immediate answer home or Ghana or Tom kench to keep that thang alive Against The Rush. Going to play I do feel like it was a bit of pressure on the c o d bottom line they have to perform now they have to make something happen against the Jinx at least pollution getupscale so there is going to be an early Focus here when you have a rexite thresh Lucian as your first 3 pick the early game had some demand you need to execute you get the skills and actually destroy that champion really true the word of exeggcute give it comes in I'll be like Latimer here but also happens to handle a lot of popping match up pretty well equipment they also threatened back liners with a tox already banned out here not too many more really great matchup into the flat Amir you can go for a get more options early game and try to make something happen but just put a lot of pressure on you I forgot already snowing quite a bit upscaling every Lanes with some of them have to get out of jail without getting tank pressure so we will see what comes through band off the table wheels with a black can be flexible it's definitely a speeding ticket not your husband beforeI'll see if he's going to put down a cell for somebody with a stroller for his third game of the split what's going to be the middle Amy's LeBlanc band in from power of evil side and they're likely going to force the LG the blankets are mid laner and gives me to pick against the best player only a power house yesterday syndrome play vs galio was up early on in the game there's you choose damage output point of power for CLG to play that entire game around there in talking cuz Okay we listen to man it feels like let's go in for the last 2 matches we care about your what is that final band going to be if he legit gaming grounds now is in the second phase of pics Xbox me to support beta mid laner most likely the really is under the band table CLG need both solos combinable remain flexible. Until after pic with LeBlanc in Orillia bands here by CLG I do expect power vehicle to go with another kind of more long-range backline made our house to your schedule has been already bad out but things like the belko so can we just saw from Prague in are the type of champion I think they might go for how did band out to all in mid laners I have possibilities of killing someone like that and there's some kind of expect I could definitely a good morgan of player only a second so far in the split but I love it in the thrash I think it's very good overall in fight and he's an expert and after the recent bust you just stronger version of the same Champion that does more damage is better is better indeed so what does CLT pick now so we can I come in there be a long race champion can have some really severe Polk and he's not here overall pretty evasive I might have to run cleanse Adidas sambas Bell right now to has Lonnie but should be yeah that was the main thing I'm looking at it very easy for a surge Ronnie if so we ever ours to land the Feds Watching ultimate just throw it right at the graduation point that she uses going to be another split Busch beer I'm expecting the attack Nico for topside is so good I feel like this is such an underutilized assassin paper people to go for if you're facing double AP thread it can really really turn around again the one thing he loves killing Cassidy Cassidy and I really did like it was armor on the Champions so if you have attack damage threat you can really punish this Champion early echo-fox have gone all-in on scaling Lake in here but Zod are going to try and stop them from getting there a little work for them before a couple of Vladimir wins in the most recent weeks this could be another one here for Echo Fox on a three-game winning streak including beating me top two teams in North America kind of logic gaming speak in their way and it's going to be a spot battle for number 6 fight against TSM in the quarterfinal fealty would love to end that losing streak of over a thousand days against at Squaw but first they got to take them like a fox there is so much pressure on this game last playoff spot on the line in an early game composition with a timer here for CLC can they get it done early they're going to have to put them down early last playoff spot in Spring 2019 is a one-sided who gets to watch the game NFL Fox sort of Cheers we are out of the rift what else can we say but waiting for the fights begin looking at Wiggly's early pressure we know to be on hit for darshan with that press the attack I think he's kind of mage build viable to let me talk to him is not that it was A Rush of the ruined King added and just wanted to survive long do in his lie to me was always able to do so but not able to teamfight yeah I think there are so many options for CLG you know to execute with this dress is a great support as well to support that is a hook will there be a policy number one that's a really good point so quickly with the right amount of gold in the pool and Flash list against an already know my let's take another look they got into that price just in time as I did a swap really it really interesting defense there from Echo Fox as they left a hole in their own jungle CLG walk right in and get first blood and this is not the way the echo Fox wanted to start out it is going to be very scary in the early game of a quick-release over the rush there on the Blu Boston now spot the two on to find not going to Idaho Brian q auto auto auto damage they've got Wiggly around 6 a.m. is able to dodge that sidestepping very critical I mean there has been a lot of talk to you about this Tod bottom Lane in spring so far they're showing up they'll biofrost Landing to death sentence is early on in the game the first one was on to solo had no vision of him and his walking right into the brush but it was worth for in a golden change the first what a cyst and Wiggly is Flash list but predicting the jungle pathing year of rush I bleed my voice to know it but either way it was read to Bluetooth rugs or vice versa it was going to take away a lot of little chickens for that and they have a vision biggest thing that I like to see from Top winners that are looking to have advantageous Lanes like this when you push up get a Deep Jungle Ward on the enemy camp Casey rush they know he's over here on open the dialog hats backwards other side of the Jungle weekly now can clean up his entire jungle all of the small camps still available for you can keep the pressure up at Acworth again he's got that extra long sword in inventory from the first flood and actually damage to become a nice for him and I saw a power that was halfway up so they should have an idea that we could come for this almost to feel I was pretty lucky and I said separate then I rushed out to do battle can't get a small wolves no more XP stolen away and Wiggly. Grump and with the way it is but it gets it yeah that's a big drawback of going for full scale in here. She has control of the lane and sister junglers already ahead no-brainer go for the invade continue the pressure and make Rush pay the price you know some of the pressure is expected the degree to which sealed use a head is above and beyond normal no biofrost me to go to the flash of can you predict okay better than school and I could do anything to be just fine. Just walking up all you have to even do is walk out of range you got vision of them pretty early on there so good job there by Phoenix playing defensively on the cat that he knows he has no business stepping out there in the early game Rush who should get there at this exact time and really good vision control so far from darshan awarded the frogs he's able to get the time in here down on the tribe Russia's well avoid a possible stage 1 of gank Maven spotted one day going over there they even paying the sake of those fryers Bloom do they know that the 20th outside jungle jungle Camp all of them are gone all I can do is have slowly been on the map look something to do still want to come to go to the farm yesterday but when you are doing a very good job has a team counter juggling the enemies regular early on only option is going to be to make a lane play like that as long as you can away fresh going to have to go back as mid laner has no Mana for each Define meanwhile on the top side of darshan continuing to push in Solo who has used his teleports What vitamin is already had to use you know with that pool start and the first flight going over the Summoner spell that will get him the reset Rush on the cross back on the top side maybe we can provide some support but mostly going to be about still trying to stand under the tower easily inferred jungle path because the rappers are taking my Wiggly in it take a look at all those chickens Wiggly has to be respectful but they know that are trans Closer by and the route yeah 4Runner still only 17 vs individual gold even discounting the 400 lead for the first Blood it is a pretty big Advantage here on the one side we have clear ultimate here all right sometimes people freak out when I see stuff like this but our son is just going for temple we mention that he's already for the teleporter of solo he has his own available so you go being able to push Tampa is going to be big for sale G in continuing to leverage their early game Advantage there's a first play nice tears he is here we have some fans yeah those are better true plates both are definitely there they're just more versatile I greet you can put liquids in them all my God gave us two with the offensive play here Ripley's moving in consistently trying to clear out the wards as well as the jungle camps from the side of echo Fox this time can I have the back off its going in blind first Trevor sense there was Justice Edge Ronnie he was not tracking the rest of the echobox members he did not have a fresher from 6 a.m. biofrost to go for this yes he had a thrash behind him about Frost
