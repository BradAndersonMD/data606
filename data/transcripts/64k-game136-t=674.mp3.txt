ballerina horses are owls which will come out on top of Team Liquid and dignity is it going to be one of those two sound effects make sure all right but we're asking me the owl rawr okay I mean it's okay we're the Champs select GM liquid 3 and 6 in the first round robin is has been a slow start but will be there to pick themselves up from here up against done reasonably well you're 5 in Forest. Cary band from dig they're just telling them hey dude will probably be linked dominant button with orn up you can see what they have to do otherwise it would just be a first pick and you don't want to give it over to attack humans up definitely a big deal fairy story of all the other like super duper powerpyx but it does have good if it's a late game damage outfit right when you're using a glass to live MSC now the ball is in his court to see if they want to do something about this off camera before the show started to play a certain way it is so good it's killing now and you also have to be very good at you that's what a lot of people underestimate like we saw a golden Guardians play at this week we're Keith didn't have a high amount of familiarity on the pic and didn't look good and this could be a game where you me actually just doesn't go through because of how powerful dose of ferrous in Misfortune will be that you may not be able to survive because I promised walk you can then pick you up against itself is not so all in heavy that MF will lose the layout of right so you work in the match up if you want to play it for JJ a career career support for the last four years but a career sport has place so they definitely want to see I want to go that way it will see what else comes through that you want he's up at least I mean every single double you care about is available that's what happens when you have such high priority have double 80 Cherry band in full SWAT Lanes early lost so how many calories in 4 sole Nerf and Away orange Soraka more and all the above and set it up. Thank you that's beautiful. How hard fans one of those rolls to get EZ Pass is still at 1 and feel comfortable regardless so they worth reiterating every single jungler finally leave and come through but otherwise every jungler is available I mean look at what has been locked so far for dig Pantheon is not particularly great late-game Champs I kind of thought coming into this game but it was going to be a slow one that has the lowest combined kills 4 minutes and that's one of the reasons for a lot of their loss but they're also with strong lady mechanics I completed one of General winds not necessarily think about much else just pick better looking than the other team already locked-in we'll see what ends up having to wait against because too much would essentially has to kind of wine both lanes or at least know that one of them might have to bring me the pantheon but a fake dislike give me a late-game junglers in a lake in the minute I think that would be their best to ask you this year so far pretty similar better than rocks are so far this year I give them the pass a little bit for now but they were just doing fine and I've really good late-game just come around to yell for the prefix aren't finding that Lake in position so I kind of see your point about hey drop some better team fighting yourself again game against the mail a dive of Pantheon Jarvan I think I could look pretty good as the dive is they aren if you would join the pantheon really goes into the store magic famous light makes me think that I don't know what pants that look like normally but they got to go in here cobroxin finally telling a second lease end game now his career then what he's been right now she's working late it is Brock so we send for sure it's in the best historical champion also think there's a good reason to Havasu 2014 top reasons but this is more about trying to keep up with early-game Jarvan with whatever type of early game power comes out from Kathy on but it's going to be so it's going to be difficult I feel like for Team Liquid to generate Camp Drive in daras to go with so I wanted to point out the Frog and Victor it's because an Orion Tab and he has five Oriana games and I have disowned like to say I like solving picture more because all their games related to a reliable they can damage soda good for one game behind second-placed standings now top two knife prop for the upper bracket in the spring fly off and that's a good start the guitarist in Striking Distance of that D liquid on the outside of playoffs right now they do need to shave but it's the second half of the split it got nine games to play every team wants to go to make it at least two games of rest of the pack to get in there and I can still foresee it happening if they pull things together I chatted with rocks are really quickly before this game is like it obviously sucks to get thrown in just waiting for the Swift but it also like before it's literally just look at fanatic last year when we start at 5 and we were able to improve from there so none of these players on Team Liquid black having bad starts in their past so all of them who pulled out of those bad starts and this might not be the game where they do it but I'm interested to find out that's find out right now we're on the road still looking fans baby Never Say Never these players should have the skills to get up there dignitas do have been a very pleasant spring split team so far winning record and then going to end this week 6 + 4 * 4/3 liquid the second time is who he is spotted out for the warded to try rush so they didn't actually no Kuni was in range to get hit by that prompt you not much doing there but that doesn't mean they will be able to scout the red side Jungle of TL something that is actually been working to Brock's his detriment and it looks like it's going to happen again this game is it really does feel like all of his early games have just been on top of words whether it's TL not blocking for him properly in the early game or whether his jungle paths are getting scouted doesn't really matter just matters that he's constantly seen so it's one of the reasons his games have they mentioned in the temp like he's got a very very worst for the game jungle stats in the league 3 games the first jet lag when he gets part of the past but his goal differences you got zero was across the game so far like it has not been a good start for him and and a lot of the reasons heal picked him up was hey can we want more cramping in early and want more dominance we want this happened and now that box into a second career I want to start seeing that out of him and never was going to have their own opinion on how much they're going to give Team Liquid in terms of success or failure but I do think people are generally under estimating the difference between second week with the jungler versus second week with the jungle when everyone else done beef sticks to fax it if you would have been here at the start of the split every team would have been coming together and building Synergy but Team Liquid is already behind the rest of that already is it okay to just really hard but they're going for a nice done for whom plastic you and he does so it in Brock's a level 2 of horse did have the E for the slowest was just the Q vs The Reflex play Now That Booty is Flash was trying to play aggressive and Pantheon is going to be extra extra risky brick finishes his first for Camp stop side need to run into a river is well and knows that leaves him isn't around but you have rocks on Ross and still end up topside so at least it is always only 10 seconds away or action and actually boss Aziz to trade each other our break was directly reveal and those fries with self gave away a box of lies and great losses out probably both got us here because Jackie was pushed up in the mid lane sabrosky take that but the fact that they both met Top Lane means Brasa can very easily go Scuttle to Scuttle as Grinch tries to clear crunch Skelaxin doesn't have a mass amount of experience so it's not to start dancing weed but it's a nice thing to be able to do as a jungler and right now who needs help with no top when they don't know if he is unwilling to fight for the wave until Greg is there this have tails impacted bring up a package outside yeah and impact cast The Flash to fly but weirdly enough who needs a guy who will just pushing the waves in a bad position was another son was there was also a f--king the way for the last 45 seconds while Blake Blake Gregory went to crowd and who he's sitting there in that brush like a waiting for a jungle out there to think that he's like thank you for finishing to have to contact the Wavin now too much needed him at some point bedtime story about that interaction am I should bring up just jumped in the way of the first time or was braastad being top River make that two scary with a two-on-two is back to give up like a wave and wait till they leave and pass them or else and then shove it is I think early-game least that is just through scary if you're flat that's my guess it's also Greg and the situation where we talked during his first game this week actually about how like there is the two different versions of Greg there's the one where he is kind of a slave to his lanes and not doing his own thing versus the one where Greg is able to go around and make aggressive calls in like the toppling situation with some burning is really flash and making sure he stays on top side like he needs to be up there for the later protection Academy on just go over to lease in a start it is advantage raksha and what he's been able to do on the next do results come through we do not wholly have to burn his flash first which means impact flash comes in later so we might see Russian toppling a live it down the line top link for push back for it impact your overall farmlead is with the set to be a 300 gold bead on TL overall some of that midline otherwise a little little bit in top with Restless wave when we Farm does everything is pushed down a well at level six lights in room soon could see an old boss Lane is his teleport is also available at the bridges. Okay thank you accused three of them right it's not Google this is so much gold moved into the mini and Museum Prague that if you're going to be problems kind of want to stick around there good Wars ikumi again Brasi ever get to push in that you're able to get down the river go wardrop artifact gun glitch for recall it is okay you saw me past hopside I probably recall here but maybe I walk run for the Outfield to give you a go for a lane didn't you never know for sure it takes me a second but it creates a little bit uncertain on the opposing side Johnson they're actually needed to teleport back to Lane for the tempo double it should already been able to get off a good BF store recall and had made it back and Lane so we'll have no teleport for a rift Herald swap play that's always the small victory you're going for if you're not taking the teleport Bob hunter that you're trying to get that teleported out before the objective spiked combat more left with your W and now it's a look that is so Riggs first and then threatened with that bubble to find play definitely could be pushed back
