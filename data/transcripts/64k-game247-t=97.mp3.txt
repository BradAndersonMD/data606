set up coming into this matchup going to be exciting one one thing I do want to Team Liquid head analyst tweeted out his team Power Rankings last night for team in the LCS so I got to see that High Praise from NLCS stand for the country pretty cool and either way you're looking at and someone taking them usurping them in that top three it's probably your playoff opponent once again off the table so that bottom Lane safety there that definitely had quite a good performance on not going to be available the atrox of course we've had off the table for quite a while since that first game the ceiling on the current patch has gotten out of controlstill bring the big ass and get the stain long enough for at least 45 to get in it I kill it or is this do you make you don't have a downsize all right will call Bar still available what is it you want to remove what can you counter pick time ticks down and they will still available with Alpha possible Silas answer as well as the rides are there a lot of muscle flexing I think a flight question me has been one of the teams that did you realize that's especially for Top Lane a lot of those carries extremely well I'll guess they are going to grab that one Rises going to be at the flex of toys Jason I call you as high-profile so later still available we'll see if one of those gets grabbed there's a day throw it away and do the kind of colors that somewhere else are going to go and if instalok on the oval right away with only their is denied they said no we're going to grab this as soon as they could be flexible over here from Santa and Elf on the bike run for some reason completely hate the champion that was what it used last time around he said since one for the record said he was going to use it at I think it's a little shout-out to himself to get the double lock on in the end sky and rakan for the bottom lamp without a lot of people have kind of gotten off of Israel as of recently because of the speed of the game especially where are the early as real picture seems like it is giving some very good power open a wild turtle and JJ has been a very strong bottom lamp one more attack damage Hill tots to go I think all the ER carries they were coming next in line are very very strong right now and are top-tier the first item ever complete so you still got a solid early to mid game I want to see more Triforce Azrael come back but you're not going through the item you're going to space I think I would also generally take him and games where I need the safety as opposed to just blinding him all the time by themselves they want a high price on the list maybe we will see one of those possible running supports that have a big impact been in to be paired with that Israel has generally want their bottom Lane so they can focus on there so that just makes sense to me with the lineup that they have the actual players on sir and frog in this top triangle of the map along with contracts kind of where they make most of their early game plays this based on what their Fielding so let's take a look here they did feel a lot of frog and targeting guys here don't want to have to worry about that long-range damage has been very very diverse mid laners I have you know he has a lot of these long-range high damage AP mid-length Kaling Champions is not as good in that regard but has a lot more generally speaking deal with a lot of folks out early better than a lot of other Champion the main strength ER of fight of course is the mobility and a possibility of those all in you can stand up your jugular very effectively expect a very offensive liorient the jungler Jarvan definitely a good combination here you can gain from multiple angles and put pressure on that lame without would just be exciting of course right now if you have the midline has been known matchup so what is let's play 280 watch this game for quite as long as that's what frog and has been associated with anivia is Champion for almost 10 years now since the game started rocking has play the champion in the mid lane definitely one of the most iconic Slayer in Champion pairings of all time and it has very frequently been taking two different iterations of Rise album by Charles rice has always been an ultimate and the wall of the Nivea I've always been very good schools against the champion just got a farm early as far I'm up here a lot more yep I'm going to chill for a probe you real quick if it's going to be exciting around the board Viper I want you to take over on the absolute water games at MSP when doing self and Viper he's going to take down golden Guardians on this pie you got to step up as well as fighting one we're getting ready to go on to the red boat these teams very very sharp Squad 1040 for Flagler because he has turn around once again want to go over all the incentives for ganging up I claim yes the bike if you don't think the lane is going to get pushed in is going to get her ass down but Pike has such good all in with the mobility with a bone skewer for pulling a back that's game setup you can share you money if you get the kill and he's level 6 has the ultimate so that we could be a lot of jungle attention towards at top at school for dinner the Garvin at 1:50 for the assist if it comes through waiting around for what's going to come in is Azrael poke soundtrack to do some damage you got to be able to get a klepto proc I'm more valuable custom how dare you Vision stay fly tried to say bad things about words difficult jungler I like this guy with Azrael it's not going for the max range Mystic shot you just walk up wait for their Dodge and get your auto first you have been fire your Mystic as you can get an extra chance it's a similar strategy with a lot of skill shot Champion specially or in the game where there's not that many variables you have to worry about well early pressure goes Golden Gardens way to get that Warden try brush it will not be at least of the flight was do was going to be Jarvan just taking that red by his Lonesome very slowly and recs I doing the same redbus do you have a negative armor with Barry Switzer Auto tax Pocus come and take them down so low as to why right size ceiling red as well as it would take 20% longer if it was blue and really do much for her and you also always wanted to clear out your red side because of the air we camp and all the extra experience in there because they're both going to end on the right side at least for the very beginning here and we talked about tonight Jason being such a volatile match of fear that if left alone with benefits of golden Guardian if you leave it completely alone author is going to be able to get for a play money is going to be able to get that harassment is going to be able to get DCS played itself out the extra variable that you have to throw into the match up that gives pie the threat and the reason that we saw chicken International play it is a ganglion is not one that's going to win outright in the wonder what it'll withstand in the ones you want but that's that's that's it doesn't do you help it out here so we'll wait for will not come through and right now his teammates santora has cleared his top jungle and he'll be walking back down to the bottom side it was red to blue drums the now is to wait 30 seconds for the scuttles to spawn cars going to find a ward going to self 10 gold and not all of a sudden I was going to tie my pretty soon anyway Supercenter in 20 cs212 poster board and they are going to split the shuttles top here for contracts again he wants to focus on that top side of mat to keep concert in the 151 and try and avoid any sort of interruption there meanwhile santora now that's an option for the bottom half of the map you can see he could go for an Invader with his bottom line pushing up there's a big Advantage for flyquest isn't really game all Miss bottom half of the map Golden Gardens want to have a safe bottom line but picking Ezreal top 10 seeds all of your early game basketball quadrant of the map and that means they here we go we are going to have that invade we get to move up front JJ may be able to take away and punish contracts due to their bottom line pic contracts had to give away his rookie wasn't challenged until this point in the game but he's supposed to say OK top quadrant I'm going to wait 25 seconds Four Tops of us font then take it to say that Jason keep pushing and in kind of gave that space there was time to go for his blue before that that invade ever did happen but he index words make you sure that haunt their could keep pushing cookie flavored out of the blue but I might be worth it long term the top we match up and it's definitely worth it given the composition that they have fixed and given that even if you can go for your blue it will be a risky fight right anivia early on not very good at roaming down to glass for you and your Ezreal Tom kench Lane also will have to give us get there through it if they come to help you defend with that about the truck and that's where he ended up there it's still golden Guardians up about three hundred gold overalls of squat nights devour going to get up and try to cool down it is very long but and that's a bonus of the do a right to Tasty Tom catch Azrael basically in the game here and you can see exactly just firing from the fire within the two shots always put a lot of time in on Tom Kent has been quite on point with the devourers as of recent contracts movement after the four of Rex ideas for with very little peanut purple bar Spike here, both the sides in it and push it but it is a 3 Camp lead for the Jarvan of full level in Leominster gold I just getting very deep now even though it's Jace does have the priority in the top matchup it's actually so deep in the jungle that we think Viper of kind of edging towards this area to and pulled out easily collapse for no man on the side but nefeli low on health left maybe UCP not going to find that hook I've got to be able to walk away but still down those three Camp to talk about don't stress it is turning into a bit of the the top Wayne vs Leeds has been the same with all this jungle pressure top for Golden Gardens he'll keep his arm in a way but Jarvan poke someone the farm is actually gaining that money back in the jungle match up and it's not going to take too long before the Jarvan has a super substantially over contract becomes even more threatening Aaron with him picking up the challenging Smite gives him a lot of opportunity turn the tide beer in this early jungle if we agree just yet but plenty of money on both these players and they're out goes desire pickaxe plus a couple of longswords is a lot of extra attack damage really on theirs if you did come back and Elaine what wrong with this BS it just gets two of them down to one more Auto attack and it still supposed to say yes I miss that that's unfortunate really yesterday you were popping off about what was on screen Their Eyes Were elsewhere meanwhile topside Viper is going to have to use the TP early on so if you saw him collapsed onto case contract out of the Jungle and is an answer here very quickly by on Sir was going to be able to use this early lethality to continue to throw out the damage like I just made this choice not to go gay for the spikes and it was going to take over bottom half of the math projects coming over with the robe know on a new vehicle and as you will end up in 3 on 3 right now nice pickup camper contract
