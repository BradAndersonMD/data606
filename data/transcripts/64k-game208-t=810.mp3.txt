that's true that's what we're here for I can't wait to tell you specify was just talkin Cloud 9 and kind of logic gaming have felt like it was always going to come down to these two teams to see if you would go to the file right they were neck-and-neck for that playoff by for the majority of the second after season They even played a tiebreaker on the very last gate where Cloud9 was Victoria to get to buy but here we are again because kind of logic gaming demolish their quarter-final Tony to meet Cloud 9 hair Vines is so much of his where I think people will tell about these themes for this play UNO steals you were to fall tour here today people will say well they were never really off at the top it was a fluke that they were up your fear those copies and I think they are looking to prove that they belong at the top of the table that that 5 you should have been rightfully theirs isn't this is a team that is so much over this year that I really an impressive to see them one ran away from the pain.and something we have to reiterate is that cloud 9 won the season series 221 and I also find it interesting the blue side won all free of those regular season 9 of course option for blue side since they had site selection has a higher key that tends to be correct more often opposite way to see now the first pick is going to be a truck in the Top Lane and Licorice and ruin a both been outstanding top of it so far to split nature box of cream of the crop I'm at so interested to see you know what the answers would be coming out here from room because Kim deal was banned out that had been his answer I thought he had shown multiple times really did destroy this matchup and I'd be excited if he had another answer something else that is prepared in the tiebreaker game Cloud 9 also first take a truck Camille was actually unbanned and on Tic Tac game and ruin went for the Gangplank of Courts kind of work they picked too many full-length very well be topless but it was obviously quite a flexible pick probably three rolls right now most typically here in role-play but pulling off the jungle you know for sure going Top Lane now it's not really a few weeks I'll pick he almost always is playing the scaling keep fighting Mages soap agree with Tom Cats walked in I am assuming this is going to be, talk very likely klepto are there are some different styles you can play into the NBA Crock you can play that kind of pseudo tank Karma we can play full AP or the Mortar Board of styles if they wanted to draft some leaking stealing from their 80s picked up here for sneaky Tom ketchel pick partially blocks the Sun hits the favourite support Pick 4 and he's going to bottling Carrey played with that way yes show Shona Tompkins was the bottom Wayne for c o g in the game where they had defeated Cloud 9 during the regular season that was where they also played a corki mid lane skarner jungle NJ spa place so they could still go with something similar to that if they did want to eventually play Corky in the mid lane but we had seen that actual strategy heavily die off towards the end of the summer split and it already feels like Cloud 9 is showing that they want to play to where the pops out of map your first picking at 8. This strongly Norwich really can't take over you're going to prom as really extremely defensive bottom Lane that is supposed to stir fry that is supposed to withstand these gangs in the pressure that steals GMA be putting on them and I am really expecting powerful jungler powerful military draft if your for Cloud 9 in to look for them to play around that and and I think powerful Lanes in general are going to be a seen during the series judging by how the games went between the two teams in the rate of the season does eres pick even just now is looking for a TOD to knock out a completely dominant bottom Lane but at least an advantage one could be banned out in the second fix a pushed-in with Vera Tom can't keep mine for the support for the four years or so the armored personnel carrier carry that he is he's a lot more aggressive a champion now there's a lot more damage on the kids overall it's a bit less mess with them catch me is one of the more addresses text supports how to set up to be clear but but you're supposed to get some damage there to see if they'd money is left untouched here in a second round of Van susteren's you would expect weekly to grab it at 5 9 does not want to sleep in and out with their next Banner yasso taken away to deny the potential of aggregate you throw a combo that is something that cloud 9 has used both can Academy and in the LCS I do quite a bit of success here so I would be pretty shocked if it wasn't the End by Cloud Nine and also wasn't it by CLG because I feel like giving his wanting to Cloud 9 especially when they can still match up another male Isola have to go with it would be pretty terrifying show it is not fan which means we would expect it to be pissed here by CO2 do this like fast-paced ain't no action pack playmaking dunkler that you would really think I sent here and would want to play on you still can win to be Jews against it that you want me and you are going to steal late into the game so that would be the more standard expected route it's not that you can't go early game though here as well and try to really push up the tempo it just that if you are unsuccessful that really give you going to get punished more money later Pepcid Ronnie of course not a big surprise they're coming through the stronger bands dc9 apparently so easily with the osmo one of course you will see now what the mid-length take us to be for cloud nine this one is they got the blind pick their match if the karma still Celexa between top and myth and also a large number of Midland band happened in this game corki as she hears syndrome Holly around that comes through misky has played this incontinence defeat of Team Liquid it was also banned by CLG against call nine in their second game of the regular season so cute and very well so GPS the same Papa and pick the Cloud 9 foot against Envy tiebreaker game between these two teams and we will actually see Pardeeville on, so if he's defensive I can understand the logic here by the Sea RV coaching staff because we've heard from Spencer and we've heard from c o g hey in Midland and power of evil doesn't like dying Midway so that's incredibly threatening rocket Kiana match up and then probably play through bottom Lane via gameplay call to enter Guanacaste yeah it is really interesting though because his I think such a step away from from copper or po he's almost exclusively scaling at worst, is much more in Focus much worth of Ford of in the leg and is not as massive damage correct the compared to the corgis ears Oriana's that's out and replace yeah I think it's going to be very fun to watch the early game and it's not even see where the attention why because Brianna has Lake Eufaula Karma has like a father who's going to get there earlier than priority in this match about to load onto the rift right now with that one toy soldier Gangplank here for ruin the second and third seat is ripped a trip to the finals online you're the best at 5 before we start let's go expected this will hopefully be fairly quick yeah I was given a heads up this may have happened that ruined may have needed to put toggle some things in game did not believe how do I have time to actually finish setting up everything in advance so hopefully this will be a really quick one if we can get going on this year and have no further issues but it is to be really interesting and you don't go I said we can go right back to Aftershock and is going to have a lot of additional tightness in these engages and we are in pasta great all right and we'll see who can be better this day who's going to be the one to make it to the finals in battle Team Liquid or Clutch Gaming I'll be exciting here I heard one Personnel Cloud 9 dairy cow still beef and also yelling after this and let's see who can do it and is going to make it happen to have been waiting patiently for this moment I'm going 7 and 11 finally making playoffs barely missing out on the playoff by but then resoundingly making it here to the semi-final Fizz sticks Des mentioned in the playoffs he's been to semi-finals a few times before and by the way one the split as well as the only remaining member of that previous Championship CLG team trying to make it back there again to be on the final stage of Detroit in a place where they put biofrost has yet to lose a best-of-five in his light is man wins every series ever been part of Promise playoffs format that incredible TSM roster got broken up and is sent to places where they are now coz definitely very very strong bottom side Jungle Run is now walking into it is actually fairly rare that the team who had long as real level one doesn't get to dictate the early game matchup yeah that is just simply because now I decided to play this this line of scrimmage right now we're getting Vision on the top side and trying to protect around that area and and feels he made a concerted effort that's always kind of has been calling card I think of plg are there level 1 pressure going to free free plan that little a few days and and moves that they lie from the egg over from the previous era of CLT and I want to see now that we knows exactly where Spencer and started knowing to spend Karen is going for the early crowd of what type of path he could take because Kiana is actually quite refreshed before level 3 if our people wanted to craft away properly and we know licorice is going to want to play aggressive on ruining the top side and the garages can't be there so I'll c o d bottom way we'll have to play defensively knowing the Frog an early-game Jenks the top side is gay Cabool police blotter you actually are kind of sitting on the back foot and getting poked out here by Lakers with magic can get very very difficult when you're in do you really have to be pressuring him pretty heavily and if you're not able to do so he's just going to be rinsed Rafi stack up the grass to you on cool down and will you down to the point where you no longer have any kind of reform in the match up because you can't even threatened all then turn left couple of barrels at their butt licker something to the side of you get hit by that extra damage than the farm or look pretty foggy in a case where the game yes I want to point out that we didn't go for the earliest game possible he's in the hole threes also taking frogs licorice is actually in a very dangerous and had actually gone for one of those earlier game but that is why I spent scaring was up in the river to protect licorice from that early way we're ruin actually had a position so I left the house and put those poor when I brush up there you saw that you could have timed out Justina goes for his exhibition they are so at least one of the primary game pass this bill Spotify liquor and it's it's an early TV back here for a liquor so thankfully for him he was able to get the wave was back to work in a single line up done weekly pick up here though is actually really nice liquor stores a good job to get away but it's damaged put on him after the teleport back it also means that the wave will get reset so you can actually face you're free this morning walk back to Lane without having to expend your teleport so I still think it's a smart that Weekly did they appear on the top side yeah and then we also have to see where is fence Karen is going to be using his attention Wiggly's going to be using your account because if we do try and put these teams into fucking C9 is the team that tries to play through mid lane and see what the team to try to play through top or bottom when I don't expect me to actually many more returns up hopper GP I think now he can turn most of his attention towards the bottom side where the starter was up he's getting control that for the next 90 second and their bottom line is going to be able to set up and I'm expecting some scary in here to be looking for if only we know how well I miss you sent there and pair up and also this is a big deal with the Keanu you can get the guarantee route into a body slam flash do weekly now looking here on that bottom side is going to go for it going to find them topside though all the fighting back and forth through and get Section 8 good junglers matching each other right there you could see the T9 is it a very defensive mindset claim they already have the cleanse on the wrong didn't have to bring flashes but the Predator was Burn by Finch beer in early and licorice uses both jungle showing volume is an opportunity go aggressive and some really important sides of 4 cyl Deacon see this word right here they know actually that since Karen is down on that bottom side towards really are going to fully kind of protect you from most gangster ass so it's going to allow our people to have a lot more copper in that bit ly knowing that since you're in isn't coming out of fog and also that Predators Uncle down as they use that to respond to bottom but you still have to be extremely respectful of a level 16 on it but it's not quite as simple as don't scan near the walls bro if you're in the middle of the lane but not back is long enough to play the proper you can still hit the wall on the entrance to the river and its progress is displacing you there it is legal damage considering our people has nothing to get himself out of Assisi chain still a lot caution has to be given towards at midlane now Mysteries level six and now she's some pressure on the bottom side as well as bow front of the queue before shots come in one more would never walk away Zanesville out of managed to go back to this side of the lane and she stuck around behind clear out some of that vision and now he's coming behind them that's right towards though crucial infraction that one in the bunch of South 800 hp just walks away super fast you can go you can see how close that
