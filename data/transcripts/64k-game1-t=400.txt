our team where river three's players gave their first time an upper level on dubious it's important and a lot of success in their careers in india titles to their names as well but the top three babies world of you guys and gold audience are flying top cyclic you what that was reasons that the zero seven forty percent keep the yankee was for the black hills right with the diving probably try to kill some of my plate gigi a playground outside in a definitively chilled out there what is all of you know goes around but again but i am you see the party dots lighting and right now the guy played together very adult relieved that the candles energy goes out of the team mates from every meteor they're still doing that an iconic the house to guide is actually thought not psychotic closer with golden last year when both parties have incredible what's the trouble tones michael is we are fighting these really really good he's good at writing the bump the niles needs to grow up and up a lot and and as of tonight but nobody liked you see you too broad itself to be outdated body you because you know when people saw the light of it they are talking about other variables quiet miracle that's illegal out niles was able to join eagle the guardians it's a good job of duel with you that the winners all of you darkly my dog with you guys to keep it secret can violate verbeek yep i think for meat is that i thought it was then the spotlight for golden guardian think alike is a car came up with in advance because he had preceded by these amount of the double beds they buried their spring going through with it a nice erased it might be get the guy's iconic a bag a ghost of a body to dear god so they became he's very well equipped uses vivien suggested that one out and then they go out there some of these complicates the word talk about tightening up the gary gary potential here for rally of rubber bands off of this performance yesterday the marauder though whether of us taking could be of his i guess her friends that i'm like jacques for or morals of the whites to argue spent much time there yeah it is that probably i would say valves most powerful top liberties can deal with such a good idea i'd like you to the most earlier version of these down the cover global somewhat it does it all want he is all that mere could be got rid of the seven states they might have picked at that mean that yeah you know there's always a yield three to four as dear john was all of that one of them and then pert near an iconic who's the best performing what will be guarding his getting an incredibly something rubs off i still am have a hard time believing that weirdo world where a good here is your jungle bed and go there like a live birth they go up over the times have data by directed that badly about the price they can redneck it is also available by their guard not alive great answers to run and then if you wanted to do they already carried out top side arm and that would be a great big early for revenge the work either to investigate quite yet despite the still like it though he did in fact you're mighty get the jungle is have gone through the vent based daily still available to lee is still available if you pick your neck and for that and you're never charged up you're a fury for your waters that that that like that to kill complicated sell the get the busy ornaments they get away knock on the immortal sideways old has not reporter or not again he does want a single one of abuse not been successful or read through his career so for even despite having some very successful run through that make aida one of the new spot he's in zaire gravity early on would not live in all the work on here and what is the same too big a lot don i think that the port of first outbreak without resembled beauregard if iconic at the bottom what i would love to give them or reduce the u. goldman stratified wins to move early on he the mind that it is your filthy yes reportedly want these are under palm springs what does world exists because vibrant robbins bullfights into the suburbs fly off to build the world's right which means that these days about sports world while the patient right now with more calls our team battling for eight days if there are a bit easier went on on the board games like this are tonawanda through the influence that a u. in zurich gold towards windsor the game that basically to be i was even how to control in our hands all it was all steve's wanted to read it but it's so they've got to strike him some of the numbers that what was it a desire to disfigure for mortals are they are gonna have a great ball delivery system is shock wave and grabbed his allies agree competition and you've got first of all bought it palm pilot stay there probably look at it you know that the that yet instead of nevada point instead of the desire at that what all the global at the source which i have always been a big fan of the strategy for this was a global so hot know blaze all quality of is really strong right now i indicated the border side wins bombay he might be taking a bit of extra focus here and gathering that i've got a lot of al's autobots i've got plan is focused continues my friend that yeah i expect mortals to go for counterfeit very worked really well for bed last night with eddie you heard how far is interview about earlier today he talked about you know the reason they lost their it'd loss of mortals while his beloved to god he that we mentioned katya latex reiki blinded began in and he really was intimate with badly and so forth that it's on seems to be good fight for ted being is being left out here it's still standing and that feels like when you're willing to do quinn way it's not likely is suddenly there's barely a bestseller that either the the of the year dangling that of a high theo i get really nervous even a private visit tina's taking peel off hard capture like likely that if you die and if you lose jungle red survivors of the things they can go wrong with that bound by that our get right down to about them let them live or is not a southerner birth and we get disease is about to go for it over condos the raft roth is the morals what roll bands at toppling that niles they know is what now that niles is is that the blind date so i have begun reduce the meal is covered and a of the two big rapes jobs that you could blinded me chase and mark will miles would say to your release a young redacted of my life and what did a better one ever thought that those iraq lot of course they disagree calvo again my life really or on states had you be they can get a lot done down there because of that gain one benedict what you got the cars that they cover begins at five because he's the self proclaimed that he be a deadbeat this is something he goes to you why did all the time kuo unity ride up and we do get i've heard you can go a bit that you really wanted to about what those two right outside and bills would divert the jungle inadvertent outside but i'm expecting it to be that without sight i ever did to keep the job he can farm out towards the moonstone be a great team fighter for this why is aboard of the bike is lifted the feet so what are either get on that says that they both ways all of your first all the maker's second all to make you gotta be proactive with as you got a whole lot jungle and it's with the faded goes to have to get them started before this group better mortals have constructed here with raise the amount of sealed with double solo playing shielding champions gaze is able to bring them and apply them to the hacker i'm ira worldwide this is the fifth i've earned topic of the year and it is currently three and one baldwin is over in the elysee while there what went on losses wonder why not at chrysler lost but ah it is going to be full and tissues want them out this is this is what really did a lot just getting we're not we're not in the skill to adopt when we're blind support about where i can or bobbing up and up their own path led you're going to be quit redacted ah how that they only got with iraq and you know it is also rocket fire i believe i am or how what go what bought lives of more idiotic honestly about that the utility they did get for it is good to be all about this this team fight for mortals they're building their cop know senator around it so we're gonna have our eyes on the early objective party toward the barbs at a map with those dragons and you don't have to stand any devoted slept with outside the provider and i'm actually one thing that is a cop often overlooked for ivor daisy about academic you get from your passover be impressed and so it even though he probably has reigned attacks now you have to get the prize for rated x. you'd it's still really really heavily allies for proper way to get that extra damage because you're early trades actually significant with that tom ed this ally you a piece about control up there so good and his basically defense you don't have to live much attention and it time group but for later side of the of course is the way you can attack although it could really go around on site usable jeep he did make it look better as i ever gotten the beer expose of flame of course or you go top and i run to be alone without much support and all dave's got things out but it will want more on the moral side very much a team fight want local opposition research site insanity anyway he's gonna be there for all the damage with some support to really i've written a day is the goody anything spicy here are hoping that maybe but i think what the ideally they would of course the tribe was percent over towards the ricard sober continent w. dot gov over the wall live immortals seth about that night defensive movement rubber bands wants back way early into the progress instead it has become very common that's i've actually started here multiple secret names for that exact opening play a handout but that guy i know i repeat all them actually i got out of the big about that backed by bogota the idea is always new trend fine old d. the enemy top winner from the tribe restaurant towards your cc champion doesn't have to be work on anything with the long range c. c. to fire over the wall it's become so commonplace though that it's it's expected now and it's nice to see that the feds of opening never morals seeing grab back and ride out that nobody with the navy is in here to start out smarter benchley did see the lord russell won and says okay both verbal climbing here without the deal is it not rise by good image around i'll see god the burn and he's gonna get the grass office well i've stuck you and out of the trade advantage but keep in mind audible help bush move forward then it's nice to think you addison piper niles least the pilgrims with more of sustain the stupor think ocean and rub it could be careful he's not quite like a flash kill all in with the brush they are good you'd drop cute animations a lot so after the result but yes there is the b. t. u. boards be more bold earl to pronounce your crystal ball to that i've as i've thought about what the f. half the damage so you see revenge using the price was noted for lisa if you get the exit damaged the drops back in that every few want us

all the land though still solid traders say yes to one group of revolt clear to take robbers while subordinates are jungle tiger about upwards the crowds to buy some time the special message that he too wanted to that refuse states that for the cool down betterment that'd be pretty solid intervention yakima take down this way body vigilant will thus began in and i'll just be fairly standard push in three ways that we call play allows them merely towards blake the defense shield was about to be more brosnan is one of the ok down there and just take the relief first recall the walk back away now miata cutting camp's over close next to the other one by the way it should be standard practice law and any jungle or that doesn't have some sort of clear mechanic that requires you to stand still like to emphasize this but not when when you see a jumble clears oftentimes that the people falling behind in the race is the thought of those employers are wanted to stand at the great camp bottle attacking at easy as though somebody to get it does say you a significant amount of time to always least you can come over towards the next one to crop up towards walls walls over towards did signature rappers quicker that literally all of them are this travel time to such a big deal when you're when you're clear your jungle blue speed is sold for four tumblers about and then that'd be something that especially people were out of the world actually get a lot from you it's your lies a big know not to kill a major teleport even though i have good health works till was goes through a
