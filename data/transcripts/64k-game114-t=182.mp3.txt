tuina strategies come to a head I think I'm leaning a little bit more towards golden Guardians I do like the proactivity in general more than the slower wait and see what happens but I am it doesn't come down to watch the Soul Eater soup make sure they're not making mistakes that lead to death and give over early gold to the team that's probably going to have his healing advantage and they will be accelerated into their late game items are already we're getting a look at the focus is for both of these squads is a I'll give you the final word as we seats 380 carries already hitting the band table alongside of Rumble and and Horn thoughts on the way that these teams are already showcasing their approach to Champion Select and Johnson coming off of a strong game FBI has been really good over the last couple weeks can be used to see if ferrets get banned out also because that could be an early Pick 4 Golden Guardian given how much FBI has been wanting to go towards it and how successful he's been on it but we've also been seeing so much in a set a truck stop so maybe we'll get that too I'm just kind of excited to see at what they have in store for us well through the first band phase of arras was left up and it's a snap pick up for Golden Guardians as hell called it will see if the bottle and can get it done one last time golden Guardians dignitas winner is in to the playoffs and the loser now that's the end of their season until summer rolls around so with that were tossing it right back over to the Caster to gets into a third game of the day thank you. As you mentioned the winner is into playoffs as they exceed the loser is 7th and goodbye you tried very hard but it wasn't enough you can see here that the rematch also of week 7 it was who his first game on Golden Gardens is running support for the 2020s but I do like the Grinch steal away go with in the first round here because that's the most common parents with Varys that being said golden Guardians have paired with the zig zag last time around so they didn't have a lot more options than what the conventional pairings have been yeah I like the Olivia however I would go Misfortune here I think it's it's easily Johnson second most played you look at the Affiliates fans back and forth I got to go to Jamie's house for a movie file is the options but through instead they want to play something with a bit more engaged was also to be there a lot Safety Lane outrageous definitely a strong later and especially since it might be a lethality varus with a Zoe on his team that could easily be FBI building attack damage Polk and gold and blue building the AP poke for the team but also I like how the asset to the team, because they were looking for some hard engaged to have a Cairo super long-range can set up Pantheon rotations to try and pick people off in quickly turn numbers are turn gang surround so a lot of play with with all these ultimate provide a voyage and if that's on a Target that just got a sterile you can have multiple people this way dog piling and catching you out underwears I want to see if they keep asking do cool proactive things golden Guardians got a point out speaking practice though had to sub 30-minute wins to go to just this weekend they are looking really really hot right now it was against some slightly weaker opponents but you know if they can keep that pressure going it looks like two teams on a hot to break dig are on a 300 win streak Golden Gardens in a 200 wins and what better time to fight for your black lives than right now where you're playing guess you probably have all year long to Petoskey themselves a mid-length going to grab Victor they're going to leave that Pantheon that can remain flexible they're going to leave that for Less who else has also talks about the specifics are really popping off with goldenglue Zoe being one of the main one so getting him Comfort at the weld a plane goes a long way from is the other expensive option to go with beerus so we don't get any more Super long-range harrassment I was kind of hoping for another double Mage bottom Lane but Golden Gardens want to cover more bases and their last two pics they can round out their team fight so nicely you know cataclysm their works really well with Ferris makes it super easy to land a corrupting canes and Brom provide so much more structure for your team fight and meanwhile close or is it certainly on a lot of comfort here as well as when I can come through its pants down in the jungle as what we expected but is always an option of course Jarvan most overall but you look at the actual 10.6 patch closer like the driver not like the worldwide top-level pics at much is it close to fake a lot so looking now is time ticks down three. The line is there no obvious who's going to be on that second was very best we could win this one final game to get the playoffs this always kind of a staple pick because he's around is always useful a pop up when you're looking for that for that eight weeks super excited to get into this one though and break the tie once and for all freak break the tie once and for all 1 one that they had they're going to do battle here so one final time please for this game five minute break for competitive Integrity get the game some lead time then we'll broadcast you one for your very eyes the last spot in playoff comes down to this stick around will see you in five hello everyone and welcome back to the show the last spots in playoffs is up for grabs in the video video games about to begin but I won't do that again but we are well I got some extra spice to add on top for freak okay I like having social media open as well during these and closer just tweeted out before the game in 2019 worlds emanated us from World's today I'm taking my revenge and ending their hopes hashtags because also bang then tags hoody right under it so let him know and they're going straight for closest got his eyes on booty scratch all of the all the damage actually I think there's also in the in the the Clutch Gaming group I'm trying to remember cuz they were the unicorns of love in the group stage and that would have been Ryoma or not to sorry would have been king and the top layer of Siena Academy fudge and going to run around in the LCS Academy League unleash closer to be thrown down the flag of me taking his red bath without much of a problem pretty heavy leash for good types of Second City and I don't think I almost I know you got some help as well I based on where the Champions are so you know about us helping out here because they're trying to get topside where is going down I'm going to see if closer can pick up where he left off after the first minute of the game damage dealt to Hootie Jarvan is very good at going level 3 into instant Gangsta generally want to do double bus and just wrong because Jarvan doesn't have a lot of sustained isn't clear the jungle super helpful if you want to do full clear and stuff like that generally makes a lot more use out of getting something done with some good gang pressure especially since flag and drag is such a good thinking tool and that's exactly what he's doing love pup crawl into the ward for hunie got the board closing those are going to be there pops of sweepers and then walk back away and Acadian also kind of knows this right he's topside he's taking those crutches down please a small one back and then with the sweeper it actually less of a kind of spot out where clothes are killed the first man with that kind of Windows is not in the brush and Acadian done you'll have the chance of forcing a dive closer that was going to go for the rest of play he's stealing Redbone yeah I think he's really low hell they just want to push that one in the way it's okay I mean how much would you have love for closing towards that brush that hoodies in Flash
