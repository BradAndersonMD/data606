and wildturtle have one before it was on TSM and that was five years ago so now we can see if they can do it here by themselves the third and fourth seeds been exciting playoff run so far today going to be good man I'm really excited to be in to pick up in here I think so much of this series could be decided in the Pickin Band by what door styles the team's want to play by their preparation coming in the series is there so much footage for both of these teams to watch play 20 games in playoffs it's just absurd and his 14th so much film to study you have full knowledge really of what do you think can do coming into finals maybe they prepare something special for this specific day but it's it's raining season in Italy targeted year illusion I think more as that's so lame being targeted by the shutdown piercing cure with the TF Renekton notably absent from that from that band list but perhaps like was feeling like the diddly is going to deny that Renekton from Broken Blade because that has usually been being used as a combo yeah of course you're sick you shouldn't go in a way there as well as a big pic so he's going to be locked in here for fly control through on the Kaitlyn 1 and 3 on the champion in playoffs not saying you can't play it or is playing bethie's they have ended up with losses and who's that with an ash will say though both of us we are getting what you expect on patch 10.16 as set in the second pay for TSM one thing I will say I'm a little bit surprised about exactly this year what time Red Sox and an event like this would have been willing to actually just grab that first pic but the fact they showed that are willing to like that the jungle I think her to give them a little bit more wiggle room on the Red Sox going to hide from their picture set this could be jungle this could be top we did also receive your sin turn in a couple set game in the playoffs people weren't the biggest fans of them and he hasn't been going back to it over the last couple Siri so I'm expecting is more likely to be no probably talk for Broken Blade going into the Zoran and so low it feels like pretty standard for him is that tank do to your expecting something along the lines of these are the Oregon coming out from my question mid laner power of evil they are going to need AP damage already very easy heavy and he is just so damn good at those Champions the Pearson going to get his signature champ it feels like these days and cazillion that was on every single game 5 in playoffs play let's not give our fans a panic attack let's just go ahead and when it's real from the start let's pull the bats the only band TSM Atlanta play the door left foot zillion have a lot of pain Defcon 4 pob I do really like the heck run band once you see the Brazilian has come through I'm curious if they'll actually fan out something like Android on the Pike West Side because I do still think that can turn into the Fantastic, we have to get that much in an A but I do think you can go towards it I think I'm acting up very well against what we're seeing here from flyquest and what kind of have to find out if like he's concerned about that there's also the option of of something we haven't really seen in awhile but nocturnes alien also is a very strong combo 50s and wanted to throw a bit of a curveball you can attack style and very effectively the zillion can throw on the bombs on top of the doctor to send them into the back line before now it's looking like it would be about that slip what year from Camille and that leads me to believe that it almost guaranteed to be speaker playing The Descent in the jungle I don't think that they would Flex the down to support so he isn't looking like they want to save their 5th pick your to try to answer whatever flyquest goes for the try to have a winning to be to end this way final Seraph lacus wasn't TSM because of a difference in style I know some of these very very good talk later and you can match up well against Broken Blade that needs a lot of attention top side fuse on Camille right we are pickling very clearly that broken play it's going to be a primary wind condition on TSM toppling will be an exciting match-up let me know ciento a good jungler in that he will play around with her lame needs to be played a brown you don't love is a practically unbeatable to block did I still favor Black Ops 2 on 2 player on top but they will pass it is pretty bad in the deluxe Deluxe has a pretty good time just poking down Morgana with constant East ma'am I do think that the, makes more sense your what's the deal I pay for the Luxe pretty heavily in that so I guess I'm not really getting value out of their fee back in the situation because life I had such a strong blind pick support in this scenario get them didn't really have the answer so I do actually favored flyquest in that bottom side is going to have to try to get his bandages through top side of the map but that could be pretty difficult because set is going to have a hard time against what we assume will be a face rash Graves he can come down can be incredibly difficult and it's aren't they pretty tough for the Creator Lee Avengers again torrent who is so durable a mess it up very well into these melee matchup so I think I really am preferring the flyquest draft but if TSM can get going if they can withstand the early stages they do have a lot of ways to win with a very powerful combination such as that Camille zillion + is Camille gets to the 2/3 item Mark you can really start to dominate in a sideline what does game is going to play out is going to be super interesting because the only male a champion the only front liner that fly Quest has is their top laner in Solo and so if he's going to join the team flight they can start a 5 on 5 and start doing battle in actually getting about McGinnis should do something in the game no one is answering to meal and so how could the TSM disengage what you've got you know, speed up and car slows and arrows in a zillion and those guys can be boiled in at 4 and 5 in some cases welcome me love taking a base this game will have a unique texture we're keeps want two different things they want five different players and the cute pipes will play out differently here as well I love games like this word for the met at the Gold lead is what really matters is how you actually play out your Mid-America management and excited to watch I agree and I think it's going to be addictive how these two teams look at the Game Dev a very different approach flyquest I think is more in that Team Liquid style bucket where they like to play more v e v front-to-back South you play DS has been spending more and more towards these is kind of skirmish heavy compositions were looking for 4 Flags you're looking to attack from multiple angles and find you're engaged and team flight Victory through that way just run straight at you know the suorin double Marksman shaker style composition in with their Camille and set their Department of really be very successful you have to be creative you have to have proper positioning and really attack from all sides it's going to be a whole bunch of fun to watch them play out of course we're getting ready to get ourselves into game one games are cross-play on the delay for competitive integrity and I want to see this is exactly the kind of place out difference in comp and this is TSM playing kind of pic TSN they are what are the only teams outside of baby really some do with hunted these two sometimes play a top Focus style for than a give him a care either going to give him the resources that broken plate is going to be the wind condition is irelia into GP in that crucial game 5 Jazz yesterday was a big deal he managed to get pretty big man to get over the line those were some big bonus there as well and we get it again here with the Camille we have seen teams screw this one up she is squishy she can go into early chicken be too far from the ceiling to get the revived and throw a gain weight we've seen to use make those mistakes but at the same time we no TSM can do it well I'm a fat house going to play out it's going to be a bunch of fun to watch for and as you mentioned flyquest our team fight focused AR-15 at 5 which means when can you break away when can you join the squad to make the what happened so with Champions like compete we are both way from summoner's Rift for game one Aflac West vs TSM welcome to summoner's Rift for the 2020 LCS summer finals flyquest have beaten the odds and made it here twice in a row this year this time they can Hoist the trophy and what better team to do it Again Sports in Torrance and wild turtles all teammates and the winningest team in else is it 3 TSM with double lip piercing and file Frost back together speaker has been incredible in the playoff run so far Broken Blade out of Texas game exceptional toppling on the Camila player to watching this game and we already some pretty interesting level one starts here so neither team actually ran into each other but the level one tip in a pretty big discussion because I was watching the mini-map and we actually got to see graves in order wrapping around that topside dry brush with eggnog in the bear and pit throwing a binding over the wall to catch anyone who would have been in there so both teams had a pre-prepared level one that they attempted and that does really create the sage of thing thing going for it because I'm going to be so excited to see how many creative level 1 teams have and if they do end up on the same side of the map what that class will look like going forward time is going to be exciting Clash I'm sure they have little ones prepared for all the games in the series hope it goes to 5 we may well get this one here is somebody else yes Ceres have done so got topside starts for both dueling that means if you're doing keto friendly standard runs around 3 minutes they were on top three and they're going to get some action down there in the 212 it can't be hard to force a kill with a Karma but with luck to you and the binding and your Caitlin is ready right away you can turn light biting into your snap trap and not about 400 damage drop the Hat eBay really interested also tracked it here because he should have the advantage in the early levels especially Victor can outrage and praise effectively both with the e as well as if your son ever uses his bomb you can walk past and look for cute rates you do you do have the advantage in that regard as billy gets more levels your Wayfair becomes really really strong and kind of compete more with that and just try to avoid fighting the Victor and war books on fighting that they didn't wave but are you has been such a strong later and I do Ubisoft from him earlier we're know sometimes the flyquest members aren't individually getting as much credit as they do deserve they are respected now as a strong team but they do have some really dominant individual players also I do not so I can take over yes but thus far we do have broken by pushing up here on this topside he actually did go grass so he's really giving a nod to the Early Learning power of the Oreck you know if you are looking for towards a feeling of being able to actually fight the orange in one do you want later on you would want to play more for the Conqueror that is going to help you out better on but more play grass this is going to make the Lenny face a lot easier against you on because if you go Cocker on the Camila he goes for the grass when the or the brutal Frost in addition to those brass crossed 10 make the million active actually quite difficult for Camille in the early stages we do see Broken Blade belt training pretty well and both drunk was heading up for that topside or going to be spotting each other over by this go crabbing in torrent will be able to grab that top one we should be able to easily grab the second of crap on that bottom side for himself though and call Shoppers likely going to reset after that I will say I'm impressed by the TSM living on the bottom side and a dark in this match up with the Caitlin and Lux it is a situation where your TV to becomes actually so much weaker and what are the greatest ranks of this Caitlin Lucks Lane is actually how difficult it becomes proponents to farm when you have them push to the Tower and this is because of the extra area that the Tower actually moves in a from the map so that you can't be using that are in a set of traps on one side of the tower you can drop the Luxy on the other side of the Tower and all the sudden it's nearly impossible for doublelist to farm in that type of situation without opening himself up to potential pulled over free sneakers luxlite buy things and all of these sorts of things so if you are so much harder to set up those types of situations for the Caitlin and the Luxo if ever have to play this Lane defensively they won't be getting nearly as much out of it as they would have otherwise hope what overall still sings looking pretty good here for a black West they probably 10 forcing early teleport year have you feeling like he's in a pretty good position anytime you can actually fully reset the wave and force your opponent to teleport back and you are going to be in a situation where you can just walk straight back to Lane and this is something so I think I was still well just going to send thing that there are multiple numbers coming up here from TSM Bjergsen with missing from mid Lane Suite they hadn't had eyes on him so they know that he could actually be around here looking to make something happen so
