trying to keep the players above water keep them focused on the next game at hand it is have to think about it as one game matters I have to win now and fry it and reverse sweep they had those before Justin spring do they do you get Cloud 9 looks like they aren't you down if they want more games in this series it has to start now it's starting with a couple of Honey band yet once again yeah they have the honey is not balanced you're going to have to move some of these champions from the cave at an incredible GPU fantastic Rumble soap trying to Target him but this does mean know some of the other pics will be left open and things along the lines of desire, which I think let's get that has been very high priority for them yeahI got to see what else comes out here as buck gaming can continue the bands they did back in the grave first one went to the Bears vs Bills every single time is Azrael Sona you me Judy Foster and again try to take you to call you out for such lineup when this is the thing you know why would clutch change anything until CSM shows them that they have to write you notes get them as the one that's having to adapt because everything clutch is doing is working they're the ones I'm dictating the pace of the series that far I'm very curious as I reckon it's locked in here or if they're happy to keep playing Civic is that stamp has been successful despite how much we know the other deal is very very good and it's just like the last game it's the right I have the stronger of course you can pull a colleague of a TSI pretty easily he's been that good and Gage Lucas Runner game was great definitely was a strong front line it was forcing multiple members of TSM to buy qss has a lot of times that allowed other members of the team to blow up those opponent and take them down as you're in the same place thoughAutumn effect being felt by that scar on her when they take it off and now this will be going to Hootie take an Bi-Flex to all three lanes that we have seen it recently in all three rolls so you have to give respect to that it is a very powerful solo Lane because of the range advantage and rocket ship allows you to play offensive line if you want as well as a stronger flush pestana can be set up to be very very impressive there's a wreck on once again for CSM though they do one composition a lot of road trips on a top lately and what I think that they're really know I had initially underestimated the amount of damage you can have early game with attack and getting a lot of early levels did your explosive charge your traits are very very dominant so it's not just that you have to put this. Just that you can see you can win a lot of these all in that may surprise you I will say that it is importantwith a v on it and a silver locked in double Marksman board but they need some sort of a threat so that's two them do just now last round lock in some heavy tanks and feels full armor that would make it very difficult for a chest on a flex dibert actually win as the only carry so you need to know some crowd control as well as them AP threat and they're answer for that game one was a, right and I do think, you could fit in the draft like this once again it was the GP instead of the Tristana and yes you be neutered as game one was and I do think that any time you're running do a marksman, feels great. Actually pair alongside those dampor look at blocked his attempt right here you seeing Jarvan and irelia Band Away think you're the ones we think our stereo men's garments we are going said or really is the best laying alongside that don't play that one either and there's a, then there's the magic damage that clutch giving plate with a conflict this one last time and see if it also dropped down the allister I'm parked right in this game called was the same last time stage 1-e was the answer here last time for tea at them as well as kled why does it not work back to vacuums I think they are going to change that up but I would still not be surprised by another funny pic because G4 has been doubts that you want me to still considered really really strong and it is a comfort pickworth Pica all right with a clock in here alongside of college do they have to dive indo solo laners Rican or GSM has to get good and gauges this time for Route that's why do we have to change these competitions are so similar the game number one and now I'm going clutches favor it was very difficult for TSM there such as want to get walking that way as well extremely close. They just have to execute better if they want this. To continue well Nautilus of course very likely to be at the Port pick I don't think that the $80 was made by any means here in this draft so pleased that last pic to come through for Clutch Gaming probably won't see magic damage I think aatrox and then guani can be picking up tanks to be incredibly frightening pillows beer will be that back line damage Brett lots of magic damage here and you have so much rain did it and look at the lake in Tristana and his Treasure 3 like you cares that is absurd like that is almost it feels like fun Mash so you know I do think I can get them are in a position to where they want to make things happen really game do they doplay making to someone make it a little bit more difficult to ask you out on the lake in for questioning work on can still be diving in there but we did not see that be effective for Smoothie in game number one and you're still don't have to pay that qss packed with the scorner in the Cadillac walk in there as he is dire for clutch in the end provides a two things we're looking for the AP threat for later as well as some crowd control their back liner blade playing as your top we may see them Lanes WAP once more though it could actually be Demonte playing the First on its off and hunie playing you because you're mad but no bigger has been playing a fair bit of this trip on a plane as well expect a brassiere easy to get gang beasts your Champion to Donna has a couple more options for a date with Rocket Jump & Buster'she is actually looking for the kill here and this is on Pierson and Hoodie is very accustomed to playing bases in the Top Lane he has played Cassiopeia very personally think that do not have escaped so he's fine fighting it out I will see if he junglers are attracted to that teleport is here in the top side of the first quarter finals with a win punch their ticket further and further toward world's least be the reason qualifier they can go even farther from there and we can see if they can make this sweep happen Vulcans very first LCS playoffs knee has been great so far $2 games now for him to get them back against the wallI asked question another Bowl draft they really have been comfortable no playing around some of these pics that are a bit more you need to that Mickey on has not been too popular in the ALCS this far to mate it kind of made it his own and now it's nitrous on a bid no really is powerful you you think it's just not as this guy for stealing Champion Lake in Tempe just want to find out you can kill people like you can solo kill people with this very easy to rocket jump slow is really relevant if you're submissive positions if he's too far up and Demonte knows we're speaking is you just jump on his head and you will win that all inCalm before the storm this time around their mate wants to have the early pressure on these minions out on them right away I want to put your son to the turret keep in mind that outside of bought Lane early tourettes have the damage reduction so super early plates aren't really that important. Easily with all the lanes were you can get that play super fast that is one thing is supposed to tell her how they play Lenny face out because soul of the Blue Dolphin most part Lira to his in to read if your said yes but was charged on 3 out afterwards good damage is actually running demolish as well this is something is some players have started to pick up in lieu of something more defensive resolve option if you think that you're going to have to push your Champion then you can actually get a lot of value of that advantage on the side of clutch do look forward to the TSM jungler speak of newly acquired on to the starting lineup for the LCS Squad at least he is the one with the says why he has the power to try and get these mail a solo laners Breton Lane skills and if you was like that is where a lot of this game will end. Early Redbox closer to speak at this time if you've got it lyrics god is the bot laners keep running back and forth what is employee early-game it was a solos that carried early for Clapton they eventually found the first Blood through Lyra what different lineups here this time around and I want to see how much different is going to be yeah I'm very interested to see you know he doesn't really have any Great Escapes here on these are you do have have to slide out but if it is because not ever up there. You don't really have a lot of recourse in this matchup you're going to get pushed in you're going to be getting poked under the same thing really here for calling till 6 even so I really want to see where she could can't get involved in no-fault Kenny's God keep us informed you could already see a big c s Lee in the Top Lane and broken line is already uses potion these have felt so that is a rough spot to be my eyes are completely on speaker because this is where that money always plays these Mages on the topside super offensively goes for harassment really on so we can try to push you off of those minion he is booked up at the turret in wow it is going to be a blue side exchange here at speaker goes to take away was not started by Lera yeah but I just talked about the impression the top like this was Phillies game state that feels like a favorite I think you kind of tracks going to the whole time when you can feel safe the whole way through top Scuttle goes over to Lear there's not a lot of game pass allowed she can't still on board soon he has complete freedom to do whatever you want Dad to me he's going to be able to actually save if you want to will keep you back if your lane in and honey fashion as he likes to really keep the pressure up has a more effective by Dumbledore boots on top as well as the pink or so it will have more control here for himself and you can see you lyrics haven't taken top Scuttle no playing around that side of the map is to enable who needs to non stop shoving his opponent and keep up your this Lane. all right well three sets come through yet Dumbledore and I think this is going to be soon Domino's coming out of this one for you to go leave for when I go to leave roughly around there for so far from the laning phase is falling still going spends way I do want to point out pretty soon actually is the a CSV record-holder across the LCS bot laners has been pretty good for his business with you so far in the early games to first wife what a waiting pay for tsf TSM bottomlands that step up in their time of need rakan and xayah we always talk about the early threat of those all in no hesitation there from smoothie as he goes in throws down the ignite Ben gets a route on the collar right there and that is going to finish up the guilt smoothie stick around and finish up that trip play to Rico's really good life and that is absolutely huge 40th MP then just getting a big deal like that is going to feel so damn good movie was on toward gear you know but they are able to fly Seagate straight Ananda Vulcan Vulcan could not buffer HQ in time to actually get out of there thank you come down but much too late and he just gets shredded there and I'll get a nice early start 40th and Walnut Bottom side was on or not but never a Chance Auto to turn it back around I never went for the CC just figured if it was available to cool down after taking back over and let's go to get some Benadryl bottom River but now you've got a nice Gold Leaf for TSM the farm lease vs Tor plus the extra load of stuff on vent is it be a good start for them see if they can snowball off of it once again both junglers are on the bottom side and I want to turn your attention towards the mini-map if you see up there who needs zoning broken plate off of those minion cameras are down here fighting over Scuttle crab and Ward and vision but broken play can't even approached the minion line as Mooney on the comment is ear is pushing him back they've got the squad it's the whole river a lot of toppling really is going to be decided by how much does a farm can broken play collect because for him to wave at least pushing towards him as we will have an opportunity to get some of that farm but you know honey is Dan going to try to really punish him here now that he has no teleport available to try to send it back on a battery call and once again they have Vision on speaker so they know who he can just continue to bully the atrox under the tower right now it's trying to harass him away 0 though lying in wait with a starter for a possible Jake was predator of a nikhil straight up there probably going to get shot down but just barely due to the size of these days up yeah that was really big difference between the avoiding. Hook as that you're right I think it is a straight-up kill you hit that book your to hit the root beer was going to get it all together and you would be dope thankfully walking away just bread so far for a smoothie conversion you can't go back by the way why are chosen gas so I'll so you can't become toast if you're not already bread so you have to start there that's fair meanwhile topside actually booty every thought and meet up after he pushed up broken plate went for the invade deep into the jungle so he got Vision on all of these camps Clutch Gaming now with this information they do all three of these wolfcraft and blue have respond so they can predict that this is going to be the next 30 seconds of speaker time and try and practice watee that way and I want to see lyric it up here because this is a wave that broke
