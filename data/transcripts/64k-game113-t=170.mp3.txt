current form in the way he's ramped up over the split I think it's a hard argument because of his weaker 4 release date but this guy has been such a monster Solo Carry through a variety of different pics and I'm so excited to see if he's going to be able to pull that off for the team and lock in that second place probably has had a monstera split all along so I think a lot of ways this is an indirect someday vs. UK game where people are going to be counting on them too hard carry them is that second place finish both of these teams have been on absolute fire here in the second half of the split-end teams rightfully so then that they're competing here in our final game of what would be called the regular splint for second-best being in the elseheading into the postseason Evil Geniuses hundred thieves hitting the fit in the rift in just a bit we see the band tables are bands out there on the table so then I'm going to head it right back over to freaking coat for one more call thank you very much. I should Welcome to our fourth and final games day turns out Monday actual game itself that was a great intro battle for second place so there is a mismatch of both top and mid lane about it whatever who's the primary care in front of me I want to get into four Champions lights for this game is targeting those players for Evil Geniuses just think it's a really good example the last time we saw on undertale this much more scaling Champion has to get ascendancies for her to gain range gain more power to be able to function I really think that Egypt is better when they get to the Champions at you more closely associated with them to rise the livelong the echo really keep up pressure and have more of an identity being self-sufficient and not really having to rely on a set of team but you can see what comes to you right now is the Zoey is in for my always going to feel pretty comfortable going to wait to see what day is going to be expecting Cody sun to be on a pretty strong back line damage machine we know if a Leo's got grabbed where to find invite machine that is an easy way to find a blue team advances Wild n Out the trundle when you picked a sidhwani here on first-round so he just didn't want to be on the receiving end of this red coming through 14 fights zillions going to be banned out as well actually I was on that for for Target Banning it up so we're assuming yeah let me badly set up there we really really think I'd be the match of Euro to know the jungle it is for God as well he's going to wait on their bottling Pick 4 last the ortino's but they say okay what is go thrush first we'll wait for 80 carats is very bright and let's make sure we know what the rest of your comp is Hooser jungle who's your mid show it and then we'll put her care very excited now that she was going to have nothing really Branch out 4th for fear of people getting flamed if if the more unconventional fix don't work out I you get to choose from freak with a mouse for some point and click baby that's not exactly a solo type of champion is self-sufficient type of champion and it really does come from your level six of course you get to walk down the Zoe he's a lockdown someone on hundred Thieves for Evil Geniuses actually take out okay so Champions locked engine was the hover over to Calista I think is more likely pick and be like okay is it okay to just going to go back for total links game long range safety 5:35 at a Crane's above-average remarks and freaks description rage because he feels like garbage her rages so short and she relies so much on her Mobility WhatsApp Assaf Shahar olds you eat a you just feel completely useless it takes so much of the fight out of this team, I'll be over but feel so much more comfortable from the side of hundred these if they do have Cody sun on the very sore and and just get to make from his side and more safe range yeah I'm going to ask you assess tactile the same but even if you are very soon you have more range than some of that close to you still might have to burn that for 200 gold to get away from a flash from Al soultan to you know Lisa and and then a truck that has fallen through run to you so it's a battle for the second feed I don't know there are many people who thought EG and hundred thieves were going to be the team's button for a second but at the end of the day they play the games out and those are the teams performed best so congratulations them so far for a great season already second-seeded be awesome they will have to play either a rematch or flight quest in the first round of the playoffs we already know what the matches are going to look like but it's I'd Flex at the very least going to be a pain to watch for so we're going to take our five minute break for competitive Integrity will see you here with us for our last game of the day for second seed in playoffs hello everyone and welcome back to the show the last regular-season game of LCS about to begin with me Evil Geniuses and hundred thieves as they fight for the second seed in playoffs all the others might have been determined but second and third will be tossed around based on who wins this one and he's been really really hot they have a reason to this point in the standings off of Pretty lacklustre first Robin how did these are 8 and 2 since the first night game at that point so hot right now for all the marbles 6 Africa dies 31st who's actually really excited I like to see him on these types of Champions lots of Mobility lots of options that you can go for early on courses UK stop since early on males are generally trying to dissuade clear Farm up to six and Zoe's really the one that has more of those looks early on will see if Ryoma can actually continue on with his power Arc the split as the generally been getting a lot more favor yes do it better overall laning phase why is he is still the the weakest starting mid laner and turn to black gold XP difference on the other side Cuomo has that same honor up in Top Lane and a certain degree like these are not bad players but you're in the you-know-what the most penalties in the world is a lot of great players out there someone has to be 10 right and that's what sort of happening here just a primary care for EEG someday Primary Care Trident early on and and have a lead to use that that is my expectation coming to this game will see if that changes based on performance but is there an indirect to love her solo carries stunts actually going to get the nice little play Auto there with the empowered Auto to and Azazel and their starts APUSH Wars looks like really pushed going to go hunting things the way I got to say about the new season support items that can actually get Relic Shield and not miss Cannon constantly quality of life for the changes so happy with that one shot or two to land that to you they're exactly it doesn't want to take anything extra to zoo kpcr channel is corrupting potion maybe we can try and get a little bit of damage cost to tag them get the burn going but I swore swore 1245 brush Ferris here stuck going to take the opportunity actually to go really deep in the jungle for an early War to try to figure out if Spence Karen is doing the information acquired
