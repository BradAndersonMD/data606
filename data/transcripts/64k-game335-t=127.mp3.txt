I prefer the standard UF Health in the top light and also warmer in their first game did have the one I kind of silly Clapton and death for a trade killed but was desolate Saint Zoe both games did perform very well so start to the event for a guy who is not played on their LCS Squad yet this split in and really make me a taste for himself to become one of their starting players on this one is going to be an exciting game to wash for what kind of conflict in play in what county am going to run through here for it to have it in the van should be no surprise Northern Nocturne but it's the final Dancing this side is sunisa Lee and Elle Kindred also off me to get yesterday one of those Dominic Evans I've seen in quite a long time before they still better than that I mean when you get that many bounties the game becomes just about the kindredall the extra rain so make sense to take it away there and I'm going to use the C-4 that for the most recent talks about actually mid-length my sandwich to Allentown is working and I'm kind of trying to play this is extra style where he has a lot of Pee Wee you can kind of farm both the rapper camp and pushed out Midland and and try to look for that part of play in early and go to jailI already said in the opening speech at you want to play Cindy want to destroy him play who can do both tried and true is never a fair fight here Martin because you don't want to talk Wayne Ashley something that I Hope Academy ran and a lot of things have been using this as a counter to funnel it does give you a lot of very heavy pushed into their own jumbo jumbo four-door fight with the early ultimate that is really trying to take on those marks in early when do is wait for him to go to the jungle and then put to the house really quick and then they call me to get a whole lot of different stuff and I'm very excited to see how it actually works out because you know at Echo Fox having to talk to some of their there they're pretty confident playing into funnel now this is I Think You're the Best Western final teams going to feels that they can't dismantle the strategy and and it's going to be really exciting cities Clash of styles and find out which is definitely one of the most Innovative grab something every team is Express how hard it has been through DraftKings echo-fox because it really have no breasts look like going to do and whether they are being random or they are so ahead of the curve at they have a million + a million if it's ready to go I like the tickets the ladder here they're just ready to go in a whole bunch of things I'm very excited for what will come through on its as it's now the end of this part of the graph phase 220 Allison table to one side and who supports that would it might fly with Tom kendzia Morgan off the table one quick engaged so you can actually jump on today to carry passport if you owe them anything to the table so I really think wakanda destroyed so sore at 3 if uses earlier today or yesterday and how can a gym actually perform on this right you know because this is I think while you can be a very very effective Champion Adrian generally does not engage made engage for the team I think it's fair to say so we'll see how well he should be able to perform Jen Karma as about laying here and this really does as you said, people all in a specially with this sort of the draft if you draft like a brand or whatever it's more flexible but works all the time and it's going to be before they get there probably not going to having too much fun to play against the most horrible length ever have to lean against on the rumble putting Phoenix cop on the Renekton playing the same song what if it if it is going to be reckoned they'd like to fight the case of any ex husband commits like can you kill a question with a question I asked but that is something I want to bring up as an option for MDD take the rumble into a fraction using the office before I want to post that as it as an opportunity as certainly a possibility in a cool little fun fact I just got his actually went Phoenix was in Korea he was playing at the end of the name was erected one-trick so she is going to be comfortable on the pick in the pantheon with his is WB old actually incredibly strong diver a lot of potential to really put Wonder behind but that's the worst farming jugglers in the game if you are not effective with your early Gangsta you become so useless so fast so this really is all early game versus all a game and it can be effective with those first few games drop an elective everyone goes I'm scared it's never a dull game here I know I know I may need yesterday I got a surprise to let you know when we saw some of this someplace to pull off but today might be different when you have a couple weeks now you've seen this phone's back from G2 is not a surprise when they pick it and seems out plenty of time to figure out different answers and testament only language these are feeling pretty safe is Portland Maine from the Vladimir but Papa and wonder most likely will hate advice yep it's probably going to be a no fun zone up there for him he's got the extremely careful of his position because You Can Get Gangsta so repeatedly what are the things do that did surprise me a little bit was maybe you don't want to go over the Zoe but I feel like g2a their most effective bottle is the one with the guy said because person that goes to a really good job of not just being passive farmers and get out on the maps they roam decide Lane the CC the knock of Applied plasma hear from a truck so you can actually jump in you can match Rome's you can count against these these little plays that Doc is going to be gay for that is something that G2 I think does better than any other team with one of them we have to see that like in this game here if garlic is ganking stop playing perks if he's level 6 can try and go up there and set up account if it works if you're starting to get the massive Advantage but if it doesn't well then you might get to know a team from North America getting a 340 to kill splitting up in it looking to actually kind of Rome on his own to look for a counter gang in early in Vape he was spotted on the worthless should be no surprise we are both sides until that minion dropped but it was X be sure he might not get you either way purchase two vehicles not too as well and if it's not going to be had and so right now the jongleur, wasting time is he coming to make sure he's safe as I shut this wave in the one positive hit the teacher if they know where daughter gets home and he's unable to can't you talk Portuguese really aggressively here early on so it's important that can track where the Panthers going and being able to full reset this wave is not normally a luxury you have as a funnel, so I think this is so nice you can actually bounced a wave that means it's going to slow push back to you and in that position even a thought of his missing you can just wait at your annual visit. It's like. According to what restaurant is not having any control at the bottom side there's nothing for him down there be careful stop Waze right now. I'm wasting his time as we got in one camp and see if the Midlands go for a lot show from cell phone to get stop side Scuttle and I'm going to find us a spot just yet so this is not been as paying off Pantheon pick he's trying out the trash to Locked In much either but obviously they're actually kind of sitting with him and you can see perks do is it's not that far ahead in farm of Hootie right now right so they're kind of using what's as the surprise gag and more it's just that we can to be to which is very interesting I do have concern for the Xbox diet is like wealthy great that's working now how long is it going to work for you know like he is this going to work into the nickname is going to work just like him I still feel that Doc is going to have to kind of find his moment to be effective because right now Phoenix is getting slammed in the Top Lane and your kind of throwing away that jungler Advantage maybe you're holding bit even for the top is losing heavily well where is he at you were supposed to get I will see you right now. It does go up to level four but if you could recall out for the atrox is Wonder is going to be safe so at least a couple of cans got taken out and probably going to be a bit too unsafe for you to try to invade the jungle you can see the only Camp. I can take it to his side of the map has been used to lube up otherwise been trying to counter jungle and I some of the fun that might be coming through that is going to be a second important they can go grab for G3 Sports and meanwhile bottom jeans just going to be fairly even like no one should really be dying and I'm just waiting for the champion and where she wants to go next is a Yankee Swap or if you just go back mid keep pushing it out with funi get level 6 on Russell and I don't even know how easy it really is the killing the right like this is actually going warm or in his favor really is a very heavy Lane boy and it makes sense to me to see your the Renekton locked in in combination with Pantheon because well such set up with your son in the pantheon Point click stun you walking down your volume early levels you dye them for that has not been the case in Wonder is going to be 6 likely before document shows up if he shows up so Todd Lane office a bit of a problem for them but at least Midland like you can see who always pushing and he's almost even inform against a funnel Kaiser there was no pants and tops I really want to go in there and kill himself there is something working with the way that played with a penchant for now it's just not there to kill that definitely is not an end in what I always like to do is kind of atom it in Jungle Farm on the Nam Total Team make a pair that against him to the farm of that guy said it looking at it through that lens at a box certainly is doing well now they're trying to push us out there who'd he can actually get a Faceoff I think he does want to reset the shield right there is a place I can print exhaust burn on the one side gate cost and everything that cool down it's only gets worse wants to hit Level 6 I think that's a big thing that I kind of waiting for you can go back to get some of the items plus a little fixing the next oil in the end it's not going to be able to block a lot of that damage turn down slowly but surely who he's going to try to separate one in first year courses fight no TP means no respect his way to go get a lot of it and Dives attempt at a stop sign a lot of first comes down here. Accuses spear not his W-2 start pulls a girl first pasta shop walk by the band The W for the reset seconds for a shot blocked the ultimate so you know it was going to be okay unless you did going to get crit down but a little bit sloppy there from darlock still in nice and ishal play from Xbox here so again. lock the first part. Then used to the W to reset second for a chop block nicely done their front yard off engage here in just go to any proof of purchase find him out he can take a bunch of damage cuz he's also just buying time for the eighth remove down and try not to say trucks is very strong you get this kill a year 20 CS ahead in this Lane so why it's working the middle initial highlighted before you know really stopping Wonder from Taking Over the Top Lane I mean that's Phoenix is alt 4th defensively just for help they're scared actually was always known as a lame boy and this is not the state wonders not playing this very well he is but aatrox is is like almost like a new level of Lane boy this Champion really can absolutely destroy people in the straight up on B1 and the tollway slow on HBC scared and then just keep getting more and more and just kind of match the race from a somewhat aggressive
