thank you very much Gabby and we are in a Champion Select Evil Geniuses and flyquest doing battle to see what else can happen EG trying to get closer closer to securing and upper bracket spot in the playoffs they can still be caught right now flyquest right now game and a half behind second-place that cloud 9 GSM club or just up at 11 winds like go to the 10-year themselves and the next when they've got EZ match of expecting them to reach out we have two 12in 6 will see the power bugle wow a lot of focused for the power of evil in a lot of respect to how well he has been playing and santorin talks a lot about how how are you evil and he know their job is often to to withstand the early game because he tends to pick for scaling pics to go more towards his King fighting style and as a result they feel like they're winning the game if they can go even they feel like they're winthe game is like they can it withstand the pressure than their opponents and this time she is definitely trying to hold down power of Evil 3 mid lane dance to wear them first pick Stendra so goldenglue tried to push power of evil out of his comfort zone with those three Band Away plus the listen to actually taken and there's not a lot of pics that party was actually shown still alive throughout the rest of the split is it Casio Corky and Catherine all have one play a Diana would be interesting this is considered a syndra counter in the 1D one and we did actually see him bring it out in the past I don't think he had a lot of success with it I believe you played it in the spring but not going to get locked in just yet not just yet I think yeah you can maybe wait till 3 to pick on right side of a couple of the other campaigns right here that will be in your kind of locked out of some kind of stuff going on board shows up you really want Karma or you're not probably would have not Lain very easily know that we just saw a class with that lame-ass, Force very very strong but not going towards still really only plays to Champion he wants to play as real or a family of every single time if you can Ash is gone a Fella's got nerve so he's on his real 3D I think this kind of concern though it is long term that is going to hurry G if if if your phone has been since he always get of winning match up in the bottom line because you're as real NFL use both have been kind of bird by that buy a lot of the other Champions Boston by refusing to nurse them selves so you would expect it to be pretty bad Lane for him on that bottom side and it really double stolen pics here for EG with what we suspect is a jungle pick up for the set we're probably going to see that in the jungle obviously solo does a plate quite a bit of set himself but is not going to be able to have parody of a picture of the could go towards midlane answer if you do that though you know if there is the ability for them to still Target and potentially Santorum instead of pushing down further process fighter write the man has a ton of games for example if you're looking for those but okay we know where can I buy Quest We Know Pua is important we're going to destroy the entire control make you really really want him on rumble or it'll all make sense but it means I feel like we should be poised to find some very severe counter picks and try to really take over those lengths if not in a winning one to imagine that out scaled the games if you can't punish me I'm going to get you know it'll aching free the only thing is though because that's holding his word actually do the counter fixes that didn't come through already for fly bites you can just throw more bands for the tollway right so it's just like 5 Bit Lane band can you really get that like super sick counterpick to slam Lane I don't know right you know what we'll have to see how deep are evil is capable does go have faxed he is the re ending band is nothing we seen him play in a long time I did mention the Diana that got offered it I double checked it was late one time and spring in a while so he still has that but it is such a different play style you're not just for him but for the whole theme I wouldn't be surprised if you just go to work on because that's kind of what they play all the time for a narc he does have a lot of different Champions played but we're gone is six games Pantone the next most played at 3 and then it's a bunch of candies with one play we've also seen him play the record alongside the Ezreal quite a bit is a losing Lane but it is more about how effective ignorant to find a good angle of device is buff backups if you want to go for the UPS real I mean that's possible to EG side right of course we're flyquest I am in to see what happens write the check and I feel like going to live so just goes to the fairly safe and easy Corky here on power of evil that's going to feel pretty solid you can easily go early hexdrinker and Spa the match up and then just go pretty well it came extinct cuz it was all worth for McLane dance you just put them on Courtney does that feel like it accomplish anything I feel I feel like this is kind of something that's how you know he is pretty plain these types of backups and they want to go with that model has the ability try to go in I think is quite effective against bi2 doesn't have any any part of that or anything like this will find out is the solo playing at top or it's in Torrington explain that to Jungle and they both have a lot of place on it you know second tied for the most played for Solo in toppling is the most played for stand for in the jungle so it could be going either way frontal coming through means that should be a top flame set pretty pretty nice into the Volver and if someone is going to be the building full tank that you can Alton and make yourself a lot more janky on I also knew decent ability to do try to gank of these Lanes specially, Mike the rumble of rock was pushing can be susceptible to Eternal gang generally speaking Center is not very susceptible to such a long soak before key because you're expecting phase Rush the gates a lot of the game Power gear from the trundle but pretty pretty interesting matchups that mean I do think that that flyquest Ave of the wind bottom Lane I think a lot of it is just going to come down to Kenny G actually getting it into her later on and it's just a matter of 10 gold will establish enough of an advantage here to kind of make this draft work while cuz you first pick Sandra and you put four or five bands on Midland yeah you're really hoping that that's going to work out for you when all of your drop priority entirely was placed in the Middle Lane on the go to Blue here standing in the Midland sign just couple weeks ago he's only got six game on EG this year right like they're going to hope this can be what they need for this one they got who neon ultimate Comfort here as well with the rumble they saw set already picked that that's fine I'm okay with the matchup statistically a little bit set favor. Horrible's do certain that we see from Hootie is will mid-game team fights come around and he puts out 7 million damage in the team fight is one that the teapot damage of what is there syndra Trumbull Azrael isn't Frontline that can certainly work on the EEG site for the flag beside as you can imagine and write well you got to ask corki the backlight is great you're ready to go on that one pressure give you a safe this can look really good for either side like I have been hotter as well EGR on a two-game losing streak like when they have won their last three they're looking pretty solid and they're just right behind that play if I spotted well it's also worth noting that despite the fact that he actually has play Rumble in the LCS the split it was his most successful champion in Academy while he was down there he is 75% win rate over a yes just for games but he was actually crushing it on the rumble obviously you know it's kind of been to known Pixies days is GP in Rumble those are the two that I think people have have the most faith in him on so we'll see how we can do again solo I do think so loved those is very stalwart and toppling the he's one of the top laners I think I value very highly because he's so good at playing without having a lot of attention sometimes they will play for them to try to get him an advantage but he can withstand it a lot of pressure can withstand play weak side and it is not usually someone who gives up a big lead to his opponent switch make make who needs Java a Larder player overall I think so low as it is very very least I think this guy in fight for number 1 on a good day I'll just get some lames up there at the top of them but I really think so is phenomenal and in this game I think solos been having a better year than the overall I think the favourite expecting good things out of Solo in this game even without a lot of jungle pressure overall I think they look pretty solid I'm a big fan of half life has been doing I think they are looking really really sharp it's kind of funny cuz the more I'm like okay I'm really really leave The Blacklist down baby your number 3 Wii CT Aceves biking up really hard as well and and they're also really impressive maybe build things better than Cloud 9 now and it happened I was like well actually are good quality receiving at a fly Quest based on what I've been seeing over the last six games the LCS flyquest or a world caliber team based on what I'm seeing flashes are going to world what happened I don't know right you got to get top free this summer split flap we do they're going to playoffs we do EGR going to playoffs he seems like he's fighting each other in the first round the flag must look at the team that will make up for it just getting so much more interesting for me though it don't like early on the earth like yeah okay well we're going to play some cod I know when and how does that mean Cloud 9 is number 4 in and who knows right they might just completely bounce back and still crush it in playoffs but you also earlier we're talking about guarding probably quality of the top 14 so if you have them up they're Wireless up their new TSM liquid you know 59 all these teams are having the potential or putting in performances at 2 to really be able to kind of justify themselves as potentially being mean to one of those 10 seconds can be a threat in playoffs right in a golden Guardian some people may scoff at that but no 83 in your last 11 games is very impressive and no Cloud 9 is the one of all of that Bunch that start with the most in the second half life are so despite the fact that there are the sprinklers Champions a Domino's in Spring a lot of these teams are are within Striking Distance it's feeling like now in flyquest is definitely one of those Squad 2 on their best day ever really been looked very good absolutely agree fly plus could look great today and we'll see you then get around the map is it going to be a small Leash from solo Sports and turn on the red similarly the dueling leashes fence Care on his rent often we have similar it starts over raw as you mentioned that one should look pretty solid overall as they're going for their early start on this one so then what are you going to write blows back and forth conqueror not a big surprise there punch them a couple of times it takes the better half. Dre I'll also say this is could be potentially a pretty tough game for wild turtle come see if I time I do think that ignore may have to play more defensively then fresh normally would simply because Nautilus Plus Mobile on to the Ashley's head very difficult to deal with you also have a lot of damage that can actually reach the back line such as Azrael all scatter the week even Volver jumping in there if there is a lot of diaphoretic all throughout turtle and I think that is what you do is going to try to do to try to get on top of that shock you knock him down so he needs to make sure that if that's the case he's in a good position to actually defend is Marksman there with the lantern is level 3 in can play on top of me wants to cause you no trundle doesn't tend to take chickens in his first clear if I'm going to try to steal those away I'm always a really really big fan of top-level players who all he knows is okay set least top price that's what I believe was through fog of War hot shot of course I spent that are on blue and pink is happening at I want to go to is losing farm right now the midline we was dying without him and that means he is down golden X beats he is going away from his land right now is go without being fought over who needs the help go to Blue takes away a Scuttle crab and pasta right back over the fence drones over the water fighting over dick knocked out power of evil as well what a chaotic early game is now it's been towards time to run away or it going to be able to get out of there they just barely couldn't kill Spence carrot ignore had this room that honestly looks like it it's already paid off that the pillar was easily escape room by goldlink because he has favored us with that they say all right we just want to fully turn him off so make him walk the whole long way around while he's losing Farm but ignores only level two and they decide actually for this so you know once they've fully committed to this let me listen to finish a romantic was great you set up a freeze for power he will you don't need to go for more look we're Goldblum if you just pulley freeze this then you're in a great spot instead they give up the freeze it's actually mean he's dying to the turret now they are hard to get you onto since Karen and it looks like they were going to be able to make it work but the Triumph you'll start coming through because they first down this level to know Shockwave that are sorry no aftershocks rash I was incredibly squishy so try it feels are coming through on Cynthia Aaron Kuni Rome's down and it all the sudden got turned around so badly on flyquest because honestly it's just feel like they got a big greasy I think you just freeze that way you have gold Blue Zone away your winning this this matchup that EG drafted entirely for and you can just be happy with that you out scale you don't need to do anything too crazy yeah I mean like what he sees the Oculus xol triple jump from Golden to the gasket wreck but yeah and the Daybreak clearly the aggression was punished clearly it wasn't over step well played the EG you deserve coming to head of that one that's okay to The Underdogs right now that they are seven and eight day roster swaps at 5 and 5 and the new roster is two and three right now in the lineup look at the baby go through and through with this group basement active currently beating Blacklist beer bottle and you can see the smallest to Farley's to bang it's going to be plus one then less they can have dropped this farm with nothing to contest it and it has a sister is backed by Questlove if they are a thousand go behind off at play obviously going to be regretting it a bit but they still have double call on their Market
