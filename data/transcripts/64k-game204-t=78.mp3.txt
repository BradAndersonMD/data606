reverse it's much more difficult keep in mind it's the LG also fan a Collie on blue side that they do not want to play fun of me most powerful pics in the entire game right now as a first pick that might even give more way over to Clutch Gaming and Dick Van let me see what your hands are tied though cuz every team bands Union red side of got to get you to buy us some how do you call a Somali Bantu Rumble there are not enough options but going to get something that's filled she is afraid of if I was xiyouji the calculated risk which is be leaving a Collie on back but it's not something your mate has played in the playoffs thus far it is something to Jensen did pick a lot against Amante and as far as your hands being tied behind your back I think this last man is probably have to see what she does I'm so scared right now if I'm still has been a great Kiana alsoMark every way there is one of those diarrhea Khan is left up that was one of the band that was used last time around to send it has the combo available there with with my dancers but I think your mind is in the right place free turning your eyes or what is our strength rather than what is but the strength because they're not going to patch up all of the holes in the ship you can actually feel all of that water do with your strength power of evil here has been able to hold Midland put it out there winter been around saying about frost a winning Lane trying to get an advantage in the Box out of map with Ezra LeConte still ended up getting a fit stick say I do want to make a quick point though about O U Can't Touch X Champion I feel like a lot of teams end up going through this and when the list of Champions becomes too large becomes good that's when they're actuallyplay gorkhali are really are says it's like well actually they're going to beat you with a lot of different stuff in clutch is working towards that truck still to grab that one pretty early and not going to take this one no problem here this diet is taken first they are daring clutch to take the wreck on solo will be that one does come through mean walk let's go to take away that crack is that what you played last game actually if what gaming win it with these reverse 10 reasons I applied geology for picking the key on aggregate combo in their game same thing goes for clutch here comes in with a body slam flash got to get the kill basically like that is such a high-pressure Duo for Midland they are willing to split up the diarrhea caused by taking just a rakan have it not a lot of teams are at right nowvery popular in Europe they do it all the time different here and I like how to set up a draft right now I think they're happy to protect this 8 trucks right now they have an extra bandages throw up the Gangplank they can push spoony down they can play another different match up here and still have a lot of room to find a bit limited of work for a few if it is quite large I think in a world where you're afraid of 18 different lug Chevy Champions and it's been a good day so far and I also like the level of taking is that she has with their picks locks so far and the fact that they're banning out Cody Johnson most successful champions in the playoffs in general Cody sun is plate silver cigarette case you're bad. We pushed down a little bit on what shampoo94th and clutch with handle a little bit then because it is going to leave the Gangplank up still that did well in the last game and ruin had a horrible time at the attraction to match up as your steam Clutch Gaming remove scuff marks unless you're away from the seal decided they took the guy gets themselves for starving still available all right I expected to stay if their last day for power people that usually want to get him something as deep as possible that's going to be a big AP carry for them in 5 towards the mid gamedoes silence have to be flexible yeah and you can steal away a dragon so you can steal it a silent over, we're all going to be a stools when is the biggest scary games that Weekly had 4 cyl Jeep West on stylus right after the changes do the champion definitely has put a lot of time in on Silas one of the junglers that has actually mastered it so I'm excited if he gets that in his hands and they give our Vevo a logger rain Champion that sealed you as a team to perform better when he's on that stylestaying away from Jarvan is smart against Keanu there's a little-known interaction that if the germinal connect with an actual wall to Kiana all just exploded all of it yeah in the jungle basically the entire jungle will explode and stunning damaged people so good to keep them away from that but as far as clutches last to pick this is a large departure from some of the things they found success on rack to go to be seeing Muni likely going on too, unless they decided to move John of toppling I'm going to be to look for him right there10 / power of evil is actually lights with the shield as well as other boots all is going to be able to actually go toe-to-toe with who's going to get bed earlier of to get the One Shot Show is there was a small update to Kiana about a month-and-a-half ago where her to ended up getting a little faster and was later Nerf back to the normal speed during that time feel we practiced a lot of diet and actually Drew Diane Advance on that tack so this to me is something that she'll Jeep rest a while ago never really got to use for pulling it out right here by a game number one that we saw clutches answer to Kiana game number two we get CLG prepared to answer and I want to see a playturn on the rift now you mention it was getting banned away this has been a champ that he has yet to play in his competitive career zero recorded Diana games played for power of evil brings that out here down one game in the best-of-five it's going to be an exciting one absolutely here in summer finals weekend in Detroit clutch have looked good they took game one and it was convincing feels you had glimmers of Hope but it was not quite enough now you're a game to they've got a step back. They've got some veteran child that got some rookie Talent we know they can step up and play well on the station Pee-Wee's Diana could be the Cornerstone of this game by Diana in-game I always go to gank that lane whether you're with it or against it with their carry mid laner yeah even if Diana is a powerful Champion you are almost never going to see her in all pro games because of calling card of so many proChampions is having a good fallback pattern if something doesn't work Diana generally doesn't have that fall back pattern there is an end button there is no out button for the Diana mail and Landing phase does shove the wave occasionally for trying to be ahead and then has no way out so it really does have to be as Kobe said a hard Focus around Diana thoughts on this game oblea standing by with steel just coach weld pink skies well then just a couple questions for you about the team in the series what do you think went wrong and game one where when they get ahead is really hard to face check into them you know it's hard to walk into a bush for skarner and Leona so once I got ahead it was a backflip game and I think I did pretty well playing from behind absolutely crazy for that Diana pick we know that Keanu Demonte is cells with her it was this a pic that was specifically meant for him a couple options one that we want to try a offices in Santa Monica you basically built out of the LCS stage two kind of prepare players for the experience of playing on stage put this crowd in the audience into an office do how do you prepare them for playing in a stadium Stadium stadium so this is a great opportunity for us thanks to Riot for the 34th Place match to get this experience just about you and the team. cell phone comparison for a game like this is playing a game like this and we look at the Clutch Gaming side I think Vulcan had a great one here his first time and it stays this big and hoping to see if she can step up the same low performance right now is a bit late as a pretty back and forth and Pua hoping that is Keanu counter pickle work well here and I love that stat you see their 2015 summer split team Dragon Knights versus the enemy was the last time we saw Diana that's a throwback but as well and said they were trying to prepare options against Keanu and this is what they came out with make them in the bottom Lane Cody some read it now as well that is a very strong start the bottle answers plg yeah that's what you're looking for in shampoo black eyes you talked about trying to play to your strengths bottom Lane trying to get an aggressive one down there you could see both Midland and bottom line had been pushing now, people playing a lot safer as there is a timing for a jongleur here and a half minutes scan head around and it definitely a good game sense here and timing from Power bi Bo Beck's off let's Demonte push the minions to him yet how's the Restless really get going to play hope you can fix a biofrost have that full aggression down bottom booties with puff Comanche karma is going to be looking to play as aggressively as possible against ruined and your mate is going to have the early Lane priority against Power people show Clutch Gaming has pushing Mitten topside and the question will be how can they use those two pushing so late to try and get their bottle in through this lady so I think four should be Vision around this bit late to try and get some space for the Diana to work with he could see the fight over Scuttle crabs they've actually traded them and really got bottom side so after first recall in full power clear will come back with a controller to try and get that set up bow went in again procs the Aftershock forces Cody son back I now able to stay safe only to see a difference across these two bottom liners is and that made him when he goes down to the waves are back to equal here no damage quite towards sticks of a Debbie doing nothing there you can make it very smart going Coin & Jewelry does not get this face to harass very much I supposed to be done on time here for the Clutch Gaming support and I should help a lot I think it's about 10 minutes in yeah I'm looking again toward this midlane anytime the wave is at that Middle Point the jungle actually has to kind of be there for support because the first kill can actually completely turn the complexion of the slain Demonte does not have his number here till he gets in trouble yeah this is a term that some people have different names for it's either shadowing or hovering whatever you want to call it though it's been sitting up for possible offensive plays from their opponents probably will want to get this wave all the way in the weekly spent his entire time they're waiting for a possible aggressive move from the opponent because they don't have enough Vision this early on in the game is it possible to cover all areas that Aggregates can attack them look at this actually now don't mind would help us look like right now to charge was coughing potion available and he's up siestas Ralston NE very early laning phase mom is very very good job of actually winning and farm and trading efficiently are you to go back to base so when they can a Level 6 it could be a big fight but you're not here this is going to change the entire game plan for c o g v Cody sun and Vulcan now gained control of bottom siding could push that in once again this is a first get infertile Drake so they're huge rewards for whichever team can control this bottom Tides teleports right back out so thankfully for him and 4 cyl Jeep they won't lose out on experience and Minion gold put the first flight bonus very significant going over to Cody Sun allowing him the dream by on Azrael up to your flesh mean we have to walk this midlane do as much as trying to get the experience for this way and get stick weekly is here if he ever steps up here we would Dash right onto him and the roaming a file Frost okay with it as well or just back to us what he's done to mate I love it cuz I knew you were coming 3D one not enough probably give us a little bit of time to talk about that bottling scoby of Cody Sun Vulcan are getting to be too kills what is it going to win around the rest of them at the expectation here is that sticks and viral Frost have two strong too late but it's actually quite that goes for the all in day's going to aggressively flash-forward you three summer to spell to get that kill a spectator can fully believed no flash from six days the whole time they're just a very good all in from Vulcan at Cody's son and much-needed because up until that point six eight and file has been told Elaine they had a lead in CS which states still actually have even after the reset as well as pushing Cody and Vulcan under the tower allowing more space for their jungler but now it has completely been reversed control words of God. this infernal it's an incredibly important curly fries never backed away 1500 goes lead at 7 and 1/2 minutes in Clutch Gaming favor tops May 25th police not to mention Something Matthew Cody sun is 500 gold above himself with the first blood and the cup the Mansi coming in there as well so across the board was being very big lease reflect and speaking to that Top Lane matchup that's how the, play or what but you do need to play fairly aggressive leave to get to that point we seen this match up a little bit over in the lck play
