do the Met game they've been playing very well they got themselves to an advantage of a overextended trying to get back there and they felt like they have a small Edge that they could use the Volvo old game open and ended up blowing it open but the other way they ended up kind of throwing the game off of that unfortunately I do think though for flyquest it shouldn't be all Panic right they made a mistake largely the game end on that one error on that one decision so I think like what if they can stabilize if they can calm themselves coming to this game they fill could have three kids.all right we are under this window chords Blackfoot last game won new playoff format also some slightly new site selection rule by seed ticks game 1 in the loser of the previous game gets fixed sights looking for the next up examples for Game 3 new change for this year going to happen rope light as wellreally well on the cliff the last game and it was kind of a dominant carry Force around that Baron fight in El Cajon that climactic final device thing was huge take that away but we also got to know that with easy on Red dyed blue but you're okay and that can be very dangerous for player here this is a guy who can look of you in the draft but it will be an early step pick here for Aflac west of spelling it out supposed to be locked in for EG so if it is just have a standard top-liner for Viper or if he's going to be looking to do anything flexible if they're going to look into that said around whatsoevereasy trying to set up a top link pin try play band the HR to the very end to say hey if if we get set you don't have to come. Be there for the match up so which one you want to go for if it was still very highly prized in Pro play kind of worldwide flight to go for the Messiah in 3 o clock to Brookline give Brayden gazlay of absolute wonderful back light damage output as well so I like to feel a lot more in top 400 yes it can be flexed we saw it earlier today in LA CA midlane but I am expecting this to be the top leader Kumo should be fairly comfortable into the set it is a diss advantageous match up but like most melee matchups orange and farm to find one doble bedroom King set fight very very favorably into the orne in that won't be one scenario but it's orange. The kind of stiff back of the door that try to farm it out and prepare for the future fightyou've already set yourself up with very consistent very reliable and gauge between Nautilus and foreign on the other side yes it is very explosive engage coming out from the rakan voriconazole in there if you get locked down but then you can get turn around on and burst out yes I should be a surprise. What has every single person on EEG has at least a route so far in there kitten going to get dropped the van tables band way here so I suppose to get rid of Zoe on the NCG here in the second round of band that you mention to counterfeit case available in Beauty and play all kinds of exciting spicy things I know you're talking about Echo into Cinder as an option but of course u d r chain bag messenger you seeing Olaf and trundle now join the band blue make you wonder if you're going to see a third tank picked up here is BG might distract until this is why I think this Jungle Band is really smart here especially when there's already worn in Nautilus bathroom with the ultimate struggle be an obvious jungle pick the Air Force and Torrence even if they don't want to take that away by The Fixx to weaken for Nancy buddies days makes a lot of sense is going to give him a bit of a p damage as well as more powerful engaged and really there is so many go buttons now I do think that we're going have to see a high consistent damage style mid laner though coming out of EG to go alongside this is right now there is some burst from the stream and Squad would mostly it is on a failure to get back into some damage done in Black was here if they are going to go with that is a lock in there are a number of Austin's here that we could see Victor can work if you want to go to go to the side lane later on it and play that type of style you can Farm out against he is here and also you are a high DPS style of made in that later stages do you think that then you run the risk of not having enough damage kung fu fight time Galley was here than Oriana's the first part of in meditating fight Mage has the consistent damage out for this way down the list well they're hovering on to Anna's real real men flexibility let's go as this is actually really really expecting you to just be a Navy style bills which does make your ear damage profile clearly one-dimensional yet there is some bad things going through four brackets and what not but there's not so many things are going to be an issue it's possible it could be a p i can't say I've seen a really long time for playoffs is physically to three years ago something like that so really actually how well you know play this out obviously there is the ability to try to actually trade from range and some poke away at the beer if he is your uses his to forward you can shift in past those soldiers and look for an aggressive trade back on the power of evil so probably was really going to have to be careful about how he uses his cooldowns in this matchup what is UK's on conqueror so I'm expecting a dies irae I double check there is there are no lifetime games for free very first and you said hey what kind of guy have a very large well first time in Pro as real men comes through Brooks are we have seen things like Cannon go doran's blade into AP later but really exciting AZ asriel here and I'm really excited to go that crazy he is going to stick with the doran's blade or tried-and-true here this is the guy I have really been seeing at all I would be interested to know either a boy oh boy by placing those are all mad and play that is making his is returning Inspira foraminal aspiring to do K yep absolutely like it's fun like her home so I can look up like okay you know what like what are some good like that's like a cross to carry playing it as an 80 carries so hey I want to see if it's good good luck on you this is not a dedicated split push with away from the champion is not phenomenal it is team fight damage I put in poke also knows put EG fairly physical heavy no Azrael is a bit mixed overall he's choking 30% is Magic from the w e and are all being reasonably medical source of damage output but it really does Venus enter on the eggs are ya I mean you're going to see a lot of Tabby's on of a number of these members you know you can see full tank with armor stat consent or you can see easily things like yeah first the tool that's the big thing right as you need it back up before the third man the begin dies with level two. Means that much damage the follow-through is not super huge but it is still a couple hundred damaged out that it forces the potion of wild turtle I think that's the thing they are getting that potion out but you can easily do things like Bramble and tapis and then go into more core items those types of builds work very very well so I'm going to be interested to see if it does for that out or if I pursue going to want to build more for that when he won because if he is going to leave the room King set that Tyson field still if you show up to team fight against double Marksman you are going to be very very susceptible to getting folks down not any very rarely gives you take it the two CS lead off of the first three wave 17215 is those I'll drop down Kubo gets a knock at for the grass practice some decent damage but that's because of its Viper has the early push an organism edit image of a champion and honestly because of his percent Health damage scaling can threaten Champion sometimes so maybe viperwolf quite to be allowed to armor stack I'm not sure I don't work trades but it would certainly have the match up and do it might not be great for the overall game save a lot to do with him a choice he makes there as a fight towards the top sides lights at someone walks away getting almost nothing from the kids probably 10 HP or less it was so is my available that's pretty annoying since Karen slides in does it take that away and we'll be able to retreat to his card so I can farm that up we can go Bora convert RADS in these types of things in and near Triforce and just try to go purely for that but if he wants to act like a suit of tank you can go the more kind of Tanki bills with them early armor and therapist in these things and just try to beef up to allow freedom for power of evil and wildturtle to it to get Damage Done It seems like it's because there's a lot of damage already between the has ear and the desire and it's also fix damaged profile right you have pretty much pure Magic from the is here pretty much for your physical from the bios so things can't be looking very nice as far as that does go also got to keep in mind how did the engages for the squad by j4 Plus work on very solid engage and even stronger engage honestly over on the side of EG between foreign gragas and Nautilus you can pretty much start a fight whenever you want what's the gauge then yeah I know it can be annoying to have to be the first in cages orbit is follow-up he's absolutely phenomenal and you got a crack is a nautilus to make that happen so does look like a Bee Gees Compton definitely execute pretty well fighting over the top side right now as Viper sleep and actually it was healthy enough it looks like with just enough here soon as Bramble vest and should be able to waive clear but I got off that fight it was a bit of a silly trade to be honest maybe he's trying to threaten the haze VIP are you know I'm fighting aggressively got to watch out type thing but taking those those trades it's so easy for set to win out on you know as long as he's able to actually get a decent Haymaker off its almost is never going to go in your favour you pretty much have to take a quick trade where you brought the brutal and then immediately run away because any sort of extended trade will just go more and more in favor of the set when you're playing or I was going to plan something pretty important here bang had to take a really unfortunate recall we talked last week about you really want to have you no. 4 tsps it's at 5 minutes and change the United vs word recall he was forced back though lost the entire wave under his turret wild Bank only gets the pickaxe there and they're going to come back when people see s but the 15 more should meet the mind control for the does I ever caught feeling really good for them you're having a better recall is Central and it's been staring at each other here is also have the ultimate to join in if there's any sort of gang that happens in that bottom lane or any type of fights like that so something you'll have to watch out for a little bit is that kind of global presence of the astral so to speak but if there's none for 4 seconds maybe a bit more damage of the top that can that can help find you something to watch for Central against the second red bumps Pond without much issue and wait to see if the Drake and again I'm expecting flight was to have control over bottom Lane recalls heel boots for something I realistically but you know he's doing the Infiniti supposed to feel good about that so like it does close the gap some what is still have to claim control should be able to shove in Bop and realistically isn't a few seconds then but there's going to be on the map and we can be there for it so that's that's going to be the response right just make the move earlier by as much as you can to be as strong as you can but yeah I mean if you can't get the BF early I can be pretty difficult actually save up to Ward's is very very expensive item Azazel is going to help us in this is less about the gang Kenmore just about resetting that way so they can actually move up and start this Rift Herald TP they have their top cleaner to mow down to the bottom Lane where he can actually be pushing out this wave and a fight breaks out he can still join with PP so if you do want to play this little bit slow Force flag make a move because Kubo is already in it a good position I would not see likes to Kumo just push it in another wave and 4 CG to be getting an event
