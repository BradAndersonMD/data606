Gary what about sports the world are keep didn't look that bad on day one where a lot of people thought hey if one thing is going to put golden Guardians at the very bottom it's going to be the teeth experiment not working yep and as they already closed your did look very good but also I do think jungle extremely volatile update one in beating to yell in 24 minutes. The first they dropped a lot of the Ross pick up a lot of players back in the Honda and BP Frontera like those are big shoes to fill quite obviously as he said not literally fix use a big shoes to fill in sneaky and how well he does we will go and Guardiansis going to go with Anna filios for Stena if they're available they don't need to pick the Santa right away but they do have to pick it before the next phase of bands do really just bought them lanes in an early jungle locked in Rex I'd probably trying to block Weber's least in with his white slaver played in day one but still plenty of things available wouldn't be too surprised to see a jungle gear and it says we should be on our band out and he goes for his very on the 1st which is a rare start for the lease in to actually have a chance of going early TM out and being Amor Farm Focus Lee sin where is rito Village is still the more likelylet me see Warwick is the champion who starts rejuv be but if you get a strong enough pole and you're only planning on doing one of those Red Bluff to blue bus to Grand Prout you can totally swing not having a refill the first clearing is basically dead in this week I do feel like that is the case I mention on the analyst desk the jungle proximity stat which is the percentage of the early game 3 to 15 minutes for you within 1,500 units of an Allied last year that averaged about 40% yesterday was 51 so junkers or spending over half of your the game near a teemix so I can see why you reduce fever matters there because you're actually not farming nearly as much right to get to text me when you get bored Total Health that way than hell. Yesterday was going to come through otherwise have a mirror trolls and Bots Lanes togethergraphs the final solo is going to come through Gangplank band off Cloud Nine to pick and the Shoal encounter fix are going to be very important in this one generally speaking Misty got a lot of counter picks last year but Foster is also a top laner who often really likes counterfeits as well and it's not like licorice is a slouch in toppling he's arguably the best food we talked to still by locking in the Zoe it's one of the more flying pickable mid laners especially after we factored into LeBlanc and Ariana fans that were happening in the second phase do I like Cloud 9 strategy there or getting Zoe in and then waiting to see what liquors can kind of his with more or less as fast as Diana service Berkeley and aggressive in your face him for glue so Star season out against many people's actual favorite aggressive against the very best players in the role and he's going to try to make that happen for a squad as they need one final pick your top way to paint rocks kind of have to go with the Fairly blind pickle top laner and aatrox there's no apply for the other side with Jenna play Riven Camille is one of the counter picks we seen go so nothing is really completely safe popping out though is we just got gold and blue on camera being very vocal after the day and kind of thinking about the leadership structure on this team clearly a lot of hey I'm going to play Diana this way this is what I think will work for us yet and personally playing lot of dental work very well with melee divers on the team you're queuing the opponent's anyway it damages and heels in a line you may as well get a bunch of stuff to be in that line to heal so that's the simplest way of looking at it and golden Guardians is very all in but I don't hate voice to support those campus to come through on that one and maybe catch can pull it back out no expected role swap steer lease and go stay the same the top link has good game for the Leafs in bladder and then for him Diana is melee going to be in the range of leasing games as well as we might even be fresh for there but does have some good set up in the right situation but it just depends who can you manufacture that situation where you have a lot of mid jungle power between closure and goldenglue because they can win early to be to specially now to Diana guess the dash before level six right the Holes Dig kit change around pretty popular not only people liking the power of Diana but also more people playing also helps against the damage amps the farther she can move so in her face you don't get one shots and we are on her if everybody let's go as golden Guardians and Cloud 9. Rob's end table and definitely going into this game Cloud 9 coming as a really big favor a lot of analysts expected Cloud 9 liquid not because they're saying the Cloud 9 is definitely better than Team Liquid but because Team Liquid was playing with the substitute younger and shrimp are so even though it was a very mild Asterix next to it with a sub but if they can come out here and have a resounding Victory against golden Guardians that would be a fairly powerful week one statement definitely agree Golden Gardens play the hundred thieves closed yesterday it was kind of in the very end that it's altered but they've gotten the soul that gotten a lot right in the first one if I bet it's so I certainly a reasonably strong team and I am sure see how fat I stack up against the golden Guardian side of course has their toughest opponent of the week and if they hold up well especially if they win that's a great statement for them yeah and going back to Golden Guardians gave me a ton of Thieves they had an early game and a strategy that works very well they were actually on the red side of the map so they ended up invading actually this exact point but they're just the other team I want to see if he can do any type of jungle shut down onto blabber because that was what gave them a big Legend the other games and allowed them to get the dragon soul and he closed in that game and from the looks of it but he is just doing early red side for clear but we'll have to track that throughout the game Well of Souls drop at the Red Bluff not claim to your by FBI didn't have time to go over and grab that one but going to walk over to Lane all the same as if he pushes in early on a couple of Cs picked up your buy gold and blue as well and truly a fun map to watch Forest liquor Authority has fractured in pots or no damage Eva gardenias hydrotherm in almost any reliable situation absolutely tracking really jungle routes it is a full clear red side for the rexha and bladder is doing the other fairly popular Red Bluff should Lube up to prom so both of those paths will hit level 350 wise you can see right side when to fight just a little bit but not far behind and they maybe this is close to a full clear but most likely just picking up blue and then trying to fight for this go on a little bit. Has been pushed in by licorice hanser the second one to level two going to grab what pharmacy can is a ways do push towards them and CSC 3rd ways die how close they all are far right now licorice iced tea on purpose vs so far last two to go 18 and a full 1960s first we waved at yourself when you match up zero gold drop and now he's going to be able to get award that is likely going to see rek'sai oh yeah oh pretty much perfect right there on knowing that he has blabber relatively close by over Raptors and because he's pushed in is going to give blabber at least early access on the scale crab not going to deal with it as whatsoever is going to get cancel easier for bladder with your thing up to take right now for clothes or his Hospital the Cubs responding and their properties ignoring so mostly getting afraid of the early jungle camps had to track that because level 3 jumpers are so powerful two big braids down here but keep has a great help he'll be fine and of course they're jumpers on top of that they know he's going to stop by the closest here first so can't go any farther forward clothing size of that store for a short time stop playing play goes in but 70s difference liquor so far can a better job it is late again Advantage matchup make it was dropped from the threat back though repeat walks away fix another shot from a family house and they get away for an only the one summoning spell down to the bottom side down or something like that but still give tutoring jobs in a hot to be safe up there looks like about a tenth of a second before licorice would die to that aatrox W pulling him back in much narrow margins on that top Wayne dive is the drum group had kind of split between the top and the bottom side of the map. Higher chance of killing the top Wing but also higher chance of failure interesting enough we'll keep it on the top side there is hotter does not get to wear stop and effect did lose his Flash the play Flubber traded his for the honor and toddler switching out so you must be available to a repeat game yeah it's going to be interesting to see how this game kind of ends up breaking his generally don't see killed in the Tomcat plane that's just what he does as a champion box link to me is what Kylie volatile right now so I generally like what blabber has been doing being able to steal the first wrong getting his second crop that's one of the Jungle camps it had not been diminished in value in the offseason so that's the one you want to farm the most so that's that's why is he black or level five right now I'm not falling into that XP pit but a lot of jungers find themselves in early looking now at the Midland goldenglue do not afraid of any crowd control going to walk with big beat level six pack up their stuff does Wayne the drought being a follow-through going to be there as well what's your HP got an owie short- last night to make sound stays alive and look how about how far is this key nearly drop down 7 to go fishing a lot of plates but we're still TV back in not64 close our own little for can't get much done for kids who want to start the Drake how do I get my charger over here but now in the topside another flight going in right there licorice does not get away from the cage he has to land a steel shot has a flash way closer is here the minion wave going to be here around 2. He has to be singing at the first flood coming through the closer and actually licorice all things to the Rex TIE fighter put pots are out of tournament so I thought it level six Camille that could be a little dicey been over off great play bipod should I give him the credit for that one hitting sticks first and getting y'all and I'll Liquors before he was able to his system self ocean Drake was claimed by closer go to the comes down in time to stop the red bumps filled Hill for a Drake yep and gold actually even but that chocolate matchup between a socks and Camille can be quite volatile should have time to get a look at blabbering vulkan support dual-sim variable to make a kind of follow each other to the next place but again with that Tom Kent being in the bottom line just so hard to make anything happen cancel liquor should stick so he the way he tried to help us all something to eat right before direct ion burrows for it to end up working because then you would have been able to kind of Enoch up trapperman and off the atrox away but what you got knocked up the damage they have the level eat up your aunt lives in a good spot right he's got this way freezing point of a stir it and Hunter is losing Every Blooming that dies no gold no XP put some deep voice thing back right now he is not have been charged play the land yet again but that's can't afford to be quite dangerous for him, pushing back into court as Lube Midland farm so far in this matchup yeah I think about two-thirds of that is mysterious and vulnerable hard to tell without being able to watch the lane all the time and then the other third is that slaver his had good River control and generally good Vision that is forcible than group to play more passively I was just going to point out there's a big moments going on in that pot playing Stefan sir was going to keep at 3 but licorice ended up taking a calculated risk and actually pushed us to reset the way so now he's kind of out of the very dire situation and back to equipment Villa level deficit do for him for TVs were down when that first Hill happened up there so I had to sacrifice that waiver to don't know beans Wave lyrics to You're blabbering soldiers fought each other lamp. Coming through so FBI on the scoreboard now as well yeah for a second I wasn't sure which team has 10 and now it's either going to be the average saving play or the thing that makes it a one-v-one so good one-to-one play by blabber right there actually if you think about the total creative objectives it's just an ultimate a Teleport and you get to 141 so probably worth it but overall games
