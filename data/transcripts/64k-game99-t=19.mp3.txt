for this year in playoff format the loser will always get side left and is no longer higher seed reflecting and 135 so little bit of a mix-up but we will see if you do want to change anything up the kind of joking about the salty runback funny things how many times we have seen these healthy run back to the every time so far in in playoffs thoughdictates that we open the lights order and then and it was going to get rid of a killer game the series and trundle is going to be a good second to that and I always feel like things get the better out of that if they have the diarrhea and you have to work on and it's kind of that step repairing so I am expecting you to be the horn for sick right away from EEG and then blackhave the ability to go to work on it they want here as their first to Habibi this will create potentially some mismatches as far as what teams are selecting in the first round but I felt like I was going to be banned out my flyquest. Even further surprise to me that they want saira Khan they're pinning out what they believe will be the response to that to get Squirtle with one playing this last time around So Cal first pic so they probably took or give them because they wanted to play this time around right flyquest are going to get to work on we know what's going to happen there a contested pick he's got games on it like it's actually his sixth most played all time to Fort across of career but it is only toxic Tampa to lose and win rate is just not a very big truck big for himAdele today at me for the sword gets to go to solo I am expecting a poppy to come through here it is if she thinks that I don't think that Poppy is is the best method of in Dorne and I also think that Warren has a v e v so I don't think they would go to Papi I mean if you want to go to tank you can go to like Malachi or something but it seems like if you'd given up the orange lines that you're probably just going to go towards a crock biggest problem with that right is it's a 10 years of taking the inferior version but not when laying but do the likely will not slam atrox if he's up in Pharma whatever over, maybe they think a year foris that you have now xayah rakan you have a really strong to be to the death Box about the back that they they had felt like what's to do with losing early this could potentially remedy that and there is film at the playmaking potential for ignore when he gets out of plane and going forward in the v v v v West Indies map of the orange so very very powerful setups already coming through for Blacklist all right well the pics have been locked in so it's time to send our ESPN commercial break alright so it seems like a lot of jungle bands coming through I ended the second phase of bands bracket City band out panteon type more likely be targeted towards in Torrance at least in is available Olaf is available set one is available to there are a number of options there and sit when he is fairly strong I do think with trundle already taken off the table has Zoe notably is left up your bored zouke that was something that was banned out last time around pieces Blanc was actually phase one bad and then the Zoe was banned in that second phase advance so there have been some slight differences year does Eevee feel confident going towards something like that again here if they wanted to run it back on the ceiling and you can still have that option to do things billion can function well with you cuz like aatrox but then you are depending upon who will having a strong laning phase 2B the one who is already you know how to pretty strong boy because billion really is kind of that Force multiplier when you are resonance beating up the one you want them to or EB ShareBuilder recti comes there is a partial block on the leaves throughout the year the greatest played all throughout the playoffs of course than band out so I am curious what he goes to next up is only comes through what you can expect that there at that was a band dropped off the table to take a note to have a good game out of this one once again jungle and pick the question is. What does Evil Geniuses play in the jungle position to that kid was left up from last time it's being covered and it is locked in very interesting so Kendra does get locked in a ton of Kindred lately it can have some really potent combination with tarek in particular not because of the interactions with your Altima engine Tarik ultimate so what you can actually do Kindred alternate first in the team fight and then assuming there's less timing down you can have it to the charcoal to Mays Landing immediately as a kindred ultimate is finishing instead of bites their you know my concerns with this with this combo that each year running is that your strongest engage really throwing in your Terror which doesn't feel all that reliable you are either having to them fit for bubbles in and fixes things like that with his or her into you and who is dominating in neutral Jeff is enforcing our bonus then come by you ask them where is Blacklist they have a lot of ways to start fights they can choose all these battles on their own terms and I think that puts them in a more comfortable position to pick and choose when they will fight we reach you really have to force their bone and only by going to neutral because they have no good at gauge a trip will hopefully the Poke is going to be enough for that walking back toward ESPN he was getting into the game in just a few moments hear the dress different look interesting though right it's very interesting to me especially looking at the incredibly high draft priority EG has on Callisto Terrace they have tried very hard every single time so far in these drivers they know we really really want to do this is what our competitions are going to tee off of this time around EG do have a lot more damage Force last time around it was a grave stopped at two items and and nothing could really die this time around is UK's do we should look good but there is good you got a good laying that's why I'm very curious if they can knock some people down with it by Grace Kendra are somewhat comparable I do think you're going to have to do more consistent damage because of Kindred strange noise as they stack up the marks but it's Jillian in Oregon compared to B&H rocks right that's the swap out from last game so they have a lot of damage vinsel here but they have kind of sacrifice a lot of their engaged to be able to get that and this is also I don't think he do such an easy match up in the jungle for for the marks and the last time I was about going to the trundle at dinner with the level Rome little one-room crazy off though we break out of the brawl yeah that would ultimately doesn't doesn't do too much the defensive word of flyquest you can see that the jury as you get screen right there that's going to stay up this time around for not seeing the Invaders fence during a code do for a delayed the ward weight of the sweeper and is it okay to have fun center until they're going to go ahead and just knock this down with that mic issue with the Q that doesn't obviously a tomb of going to this way Spencer is going to get a solo effort on this red bank and they were the Nazis that they really wanted Lane control because when you go for these Marksman junglers if you are in a marksman vs. melee matchup in the jungle if you can actually take away your opponent's red you can really run that one d one because wreck site without right against Kindred with red that is very one-sided for the Kindred in the early matchups because of the additional kiting ability that you have so that's why I think both of the grades and the Kindred game they went to a poor start they wanted your head up for that date of potentially even take that away from their parents but obviously very willing to defend or read me Romeo there bot Lane trying to prevent any potential take away their to make sure thing for I can still have them run of the Jungle so a lot of this is going to be kind of down two outfits Karen is able to play out to leave early levels because this is my most played Champions is this can't be in that I really love but you are extremely dependent on your ability to do with the opposing jungler often times to actually pick up these marks because very Telegraph where you want to go and you need to kind of try to get that for more point. That is a sleep somebody I love that place up for the spell Thief movie pick up as well for some extra moves me to bring his own the deal and I just get to write pack out of there so it's rate of Summoners as now EG look for someplace getting a Blu Cantrell and it can happen though blackbear just ran off towards 2 words where his Kendrick would be getting the very lucky Mark spawn here he went outside for that Scuttle it's just 50/50 on which schedule is going to have that first marketing that always feels so so good and it's also going to mean at 3 buff start because his bottling had the full push and was actually starting of Temple invade so sinh torrent giving up his blue running straight toward stop he's going to try to kill Kumo easy follow through with its first Blood Top Lane in Tank vs. Fighter for flyquest is invading his blue where do you think that the right side is if he's not going to bust out of the map he's got to be tough but Google had the wave in an awkward spot maybe you felt like you needed to try to shove it in his yeah it looks like he was just trying to reset that way but a portion for him he flashes from one side of the dock of to the other still gets hit by that and is going to go down for Nez Perce weapons during spawning on those wrappers and this is why you have to be strong enough to be able to do a strong enough to have pushing lanes because you want to be able to fight for these marks in and getting them really does amp up your power massively and getting to for is it sometimes the difference between successful team fights or not because of all the additional range that you get when you complete those first four marks anybody. If midlane wasn't a good enough spot but power of evil with ignore roaming had pushed control so they couldn't really walk down and play for the Raptor camp in the end of the day to do K had to let the way to push a nice talking to you at the ESPYs Rockin the boat lanes and that is the first offense with Mark denied right there no chance to pick up easily clean claims and cleaned out by santorin is it going to be specific threat the midline wave as Peewee walks back to help make sure that link they safe ignore going to stay as well as Shepherds Lane in and actually can force the studio yeah which can really punished as you can as you can have to take a slow walk back to Lane and he's going to lose by this way for the happens that is so frustrating because you're not playing with EPS is UK you have to have your FaceTiming they're having to support actually just gives up some for his time to breed that out you know you're going to be falling behind on experience falling behind on gold as a result of it so it's always a very frustrating experience against you but I do get you know it's playing a champion that he always has very safe range way up there so he will be able to get back to there and push it in without too too much worry it's not going to be like a permanent fries because surely if you done fries that but solo is 6in tour in his top and there is the potential of looking for Kumo here as they now know that River brushes clear and solo could look to start up with his ultimate if he feels confident Oquendo Center want to walk around he knows Kumo right over there because he would turn percents as well as the actual minions in the meantime spend time down the bottom side Motley control it was pushed in or near and how to plaster over the wall knows it to be respectful of what Saint George done to him this is really well done though from EG again this is one of those situations where when your your jugular has bought that control you have to give up on the top side so cool this latest date Turtle will give way out there I was very well. Chocolate glaze without rooting Summoners a no-kill very back-and-forth fight there no kills on either side but they do get a couple flashes off and Spence Karen and Days Lil for the flash of ignorant in Torrance flashes earlier in that played in a flashy still slightly in the Des rosiers Aflac last but really anytime soon
