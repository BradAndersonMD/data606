Team Liquid from ear now switching side CSM Away Rise and something else enjoy yourself a plate into the early stages and I'm so excited I could put him in a favorable matchup against Broken Blade and see if he can make something workDSM gave to Broken play the last time around in the play the fact you was down early he's certainly turned it on late and it was not even one huge place around this way for this squad cleaners for later on and look at the band position on the right side in game 1highly probable here for TSM in the first round on liquid Side by it personal pics when you know that that is coming it's some sort of kill laying in the bottom side because we are excited to have grapes are saying they have great Polk and drawn-out Lane if you can burst down the swishy Champion than that may be a way in spring come out for before we know he's done for blitzcrank but it's around your time and windows of your Tarik ultimate coming. So these three Champions we've already being used in the ALCS extremely effectively this what is the permutation used against TSM by Cloud Nine this is how Cloud9 btsm with it though it's pretty picshear it hear it again around that bottom Lane for a case to be able to because you are always very quickly there a lot of possible kill targets if it's part of the jugglers are well-equippedafter that wreck site and hecarim can have very very potent effect on that bottom side Maps however number to hear focus on the silver lamp. See you soon as one of the team's most known for irelia Broken Blade of course they are here in liquid that is coming to watch out for it. I'm also going to be really interested in something like illusion or corky and I have seen those solid composition to be very effective as you go later on to the game or so much protection or that Mark thenfailure of his career spans of Court impressive as well intellect over and what is it going to be actually Aurelia for the way, your way I love this place throw down if you have a hacker materially a flying inveterate ultimate Lux ultimate coming over top to someone like this or the apps you don't have those moves that is incredibly threatening is going to help me pull a sea hear yourself if you catch someone they're probably going to die especially at 7 you're talking about these offensive plays good junglers have so much pressure on their shoulders early on in the game you can stove off pretty much anywhere on the map exactly as you have to play with almost less respect I feel to the jungler in a way that you have to know that you're so I cannot be everywhere these are volatile matchups you can't play with fear you can't expect is everywhere what area of the map is under attack now there's a chance probably the greatest player of all time in Bowie Let's see how it goes for game 2 since franchising since this new iteration of Team Liquid they have only known winning in the finals already TSM have delivered them a single loss and looking to take over the series will the veterans stand strong Acadian first into the pixel price year into the river defensive openings for both sides feels like there's so much pressure on TL two have Effectiveness in the earlier stages of this game know when you're looking over at csm's composition their 5e 5 late-game should be incredibly dumb and there's so much protection so much shielding and healing that is going to come through between box Derek and Sona and there's there's nothing to be found on the TL side there's no one that is going to be too hard for them to knock down no takes in this game my friend this is all about who strikes first you land your Scotia you get your kills lots of Firepower on both sides very likely to be Warrior 24/7 backroom Forward Motion hear Acadian how does Harry restauran the wreck site and still looking fruit Kilz despite a one-in-four squirrel and a certain point was a positive factor in the champion the Kindred band pays off the wreck site I get to hack for any way to Katie should feel comfortable here and we've got to remember the last time we did see this against TSM it wasn't sure how it got credible gate where he was a very far ahead of that fade background looks so so powerful. Should have the early advantage and in the power so we'll see Smitty can make it a different story here against Acadia Harley Poe put a better trade for his van actually and he lands the auto attack and get the extra gold for by here comes the pope for core jjq start and he's going to get his golden, I think it's both scale very well with ability power and gold again for people who haven't seen this quite yet been terrorizing solo queue it's been throughout Pro play but they kleptomancy and they spell thieves on the Sona not going for the answer is a paid at smoothie to Flat knowing you would not just throw out the dads out there for no reason and that is going to give Smithy time to get double Scuttle here and it got this bottom light has to play off of pressures I asked so so strong Atlanta get you can protect them from pot smoking such an early recall of in fact definitely a rough situation to be in there for impacting likely will have to expend his teleport that wave is going to push away from actually stacked it if you walked back to his way it's also a bit closer to CL500 impact going to have to pee pee back and now Broken Blade will shift into pushing boulder he's going to try to reset this way to get his phone face off and potentially save that TP Advantage what's faster while he's doing it and it's been three years since Lux was last scene of the ALCS bjorksten this is his kind of freaking is Zoe Jensen thought it was heimendinger yours and brings in the Zoe just going to pick did not look very good erection almost always looks amazing on this final stage ginseng it to grab his title Pearson almost always the one who has stopped him that is Jensen ubu City Altec at that first title fee has been chasing that for years and thought this was the squad to win with you all right tracking the junglers as they're going to be so important in this early game Xfinity the time is 1 in baiting into Acadian Pride of the jungle did not get the pink with a passive quite yet and tries to track him down but to slow spot some now but it's definitely too late for me to go back to results of the Jungle and take himself that frog Camp he was trying to take advantage of the distinct recalls there with Purex and back and bass recalling on the luck for the office to play it definitely win the ones you want supposed to be later can come over but Acadian if she has them to avoid the early attempt and disadvantage for Broken Blade on the top side it's actually quite significant because when you're playing a pushing to be to pot Lane you don't have to be so scared about the G6 heliports on the top side of map Broken Blade could be Jeeping behind you could come in and punish you especially with the Flash what I meant you talk about Lane leave this spot Lane difference is massive keep my Teryx is a primary farmer you can compare smoothie do double for actual C is in the land. What is doubling him right now that are not allowed to farm against ask Cyrus he's missed a lot right here so it will be just let's go over all the point of this and then paired Discounters pick in the bottom side Broken Blade the story for the topside there you can see continuing to go for it Smithy does pick up the shuttle crap by Stryper text impact on that very important split push as they do get close to the level 6 possibility that is where the cannon really has to worry Aurelius level six all in Kill bread must be warded again then not quite helping with all those last it's right there 25 to 44 the farm difference that pink Ward will keep them safe for now and that is quite a bit of time invested while said he was taking cops cuddle recalling resetting that would damage here in the mid lane but that's still alive I think you can see by Jensen salt cool down there he just went for one of those old plays activate the portal and you should probably just Lance's there at the initiation point of the cash point they are getting him on the return of the Roar. Huge big amount of damage traded through and see if it turns into any sort of Midland control the wards around this area do I allow the junglers to get so much more movement off speaking also of those level six all in Ash's Ira is reputed for that certainly the ability to actually hit that ass off Arrow guaranteeing the route from zaira Karen TV also will they had they're going to hit Level 6 faster very likely event in smoothie will have to be very careful smoothie is not immune to time here exactly with a rek'sai you can go for a tower. Killed a soda before the tereck ultimate iwan fals all the way down expecting continuing to invade here with Jensen after the play Bush they got the wards and Acadian there's no vision on this Redbox so they're not going to go for the smite that it's Betty Who grabs it and look at the difference here 700 gold up 14 liquid and I was going to forcing keep printing money later on that Prospect and can never go away can keep that going later about the top-flight once again but it's still look at how good looking pretty solid impact doing very well for himself once again meanwhile jugglers not able to get any big early action down I do believe this favors Acadian on the head from approaching the level six hair but again as we keep mentioning power. Possibility of topside fix up to the Cross will it be for a broken plate throw down pretty low and that you could be to kill had to flash the price speaker for it would have been a death. I did not want to get marked and Acadian couldn't quite get in front of block that one in time so it's on the top side and that opens up possibilities we do have a snow at level six directing to be very close behind and that is that window tlr going to be look
