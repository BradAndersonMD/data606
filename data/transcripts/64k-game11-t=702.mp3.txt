do you know it's going to be a very uphill battle it sits for C vs onesie from the Locking group stage it's a team that is you know what are the favorites of the whole tournament versus early in the game yesterday right now what I want from them is is a lot of water warm with saying you like them right like malphite great easy way to engage they played malphite dragons yesterday and if it weren't for that throw out bearing honestly they they probably would have won that game yes there are planets made some mistakes and put them in that position but they went for an easy position they played towards team fight or stacking dragons simple win condition I think that is a smart way to do it I already do hundred thieves looking like they want to spread the map going towards TF I think that can be a strong answer towards teams that just want a group and do one thing it's a draft winning so lame try to split the map try to make your opponents have difficult decisions to deal with so I'm already kind of liking 100 thieves is going towards but I still don't think that should just wait Immortals from that.game plan it was seraphine with hack Rim you have Yahoo but you have already in your birth defects say that are not playing more seraphine I understand just like the Leafs meta is yet to play engage Dunham's sport roll with tank up there but is there to make an overall stronger grasp on the fan already but A lot's going back and forth quickly Lucian picked up here for pretty to be decanted Tomatoes supposed to say I mean I think we have to remember there's a possibility that Lucien could go to bot Lane Bogart working to be mid-length you know pretty much only where you can receive these days and competitive but I agree I like the style of composition I tend to agree with youpoint about the engage Sports I do think you can go Mala Jones where I do think that there are great tanks in the Top Lane right now you do not have to go with it more strict range Power farming style you know out of out of the Jungle or even out of the top lamp Lane Cruisers and then Fighters and what not you can just go malphite as we saw them do yesterday and are getting banned out here I think Volver we called in an LLC before brought that out in a law said leave it like that can work you know there are different approaches you're even or and I'm totally fine with a but of course it is scary when you're so phony you're going up again someday on a dominant pick up early, vote is very very powerful I don't think it's quite as good as this moment Thalia but it is still incredibly threatening is not a strong early jungler so you already know your jugular is not going to have priority you already expect going to be invading potluck having pressure so I could understand if a mortal who don't want to go through just like an automatic lose Lanes I'll talk later but I still think that might beyour best chance kind of seed d'Alene try to withstand the onslaught in the early game and then make something happen later on because if you go to like a carry hear that supposed to be a good match up well with the sound of One V one true all right leg is very very strong therapy Leona he's a really good like you got a ton of CPU. Got pretty good damage overall but I would not find it a t care with some self-heal you're really not Eataly getting away for FBI physical like gin or Ash like this killshot going to land on you and it's going to be really tough I would not mind something like aziah even a stiffer could kind of work with belt and whatnot because I work on going to come through this gives them more direct with fresh off the table and then being taken away rentals gone do you know there's a kind of dance is there is going to be here for Mortals we did seestandings this week but who knows what year did play it today and feel like he was really that much of a part of the game to be honest with you, but it was in there this is like the most 139 Lucian carp ever really think so I think it's karma top is my assumption that will be so just kind of deal with the Renekton I think that we are going to see the moon staff build from the karma top just go straight up full on team fight this is the most group and fight South composition pretty much ever no one wants to split Bush no one wants to be in the side lane it's double enchanter it's go button with the Leona go button with the acronym and ever will buffing up Lucian who has got to have a good game now pretty much be strong to be Amplified by these men who is Jane Curtin really kind of make it worthwhile guess you could be popping up potluck there too but it is low on damaged if either potluck were pretty have a bad game so there early game is important on the other side we have 131 we have early gamedominance with the jungler and we have to your point a great Marksman for absorbing that engaged for a real thing when the heck are elfs into immune that fear to avoid that for your vehicle pulled through and obviously they have some good go buttons to so they're going to try to be splitting the map but I like what Immortals drafted here I think it's super smart given that the mismatch as far as team skill you have a way to went very clearly hear a little bit much on the red side I I'm a sucker for Underdog victories and so like that it is what it is like really want see if it can work I got to do things differently Goods to bring up top bun up in the in the toppling over here with the car again this guy who actually has played a lot of August 3rd, game of pro play the only had a few years to play all down to the opl so excited to help things work wellwe saw some day play record against Quinn miles and it looked easy for him he went down a Tish CVS and then every day became a kill and then he was waiting for us the game and Niles was useless on the Quin Karma has a better fall back part of the window so even if we had the same situation of someday Lane Kingdom and clothes are showing up with this at least a fallback pattern for a top bun but yes hundred thieves are an outstanding team they're the best top later in the entire league they have a bit later and the very best of the entire thing as well I have a really good but I knowit's a meme where you're like Sunday think closer to you over a good hundred thieves are outstanding team they come in as favorite think of it expected to they've got their players as well and I want to see even going to be that back-to-back 25-minute when's the people think coming in or from Mortals really Immortals Academy to own Academy sure could surprise us and make us closer to be a banger I'm excited for it we've got some some great casters and free Buffalo game now so it's not going to amount to anything but I like these types of Blake Bortles is just doing it for man stack over by the Red Bluff expected in invades their we do see that the level 1 W on work on you can use this to go over and then we are trying to hope forwhere is you're actually catching someone camping out at the blue buff right and I think those types of invades are worthwhile you mix those in and it changes up how your phone is have to respond how your phone is have to consider what you could be doing at level one in this game nothing does really happened but the very least they do get award over by that blue bus will be able to track him a little bit when you guys come down to the Lord that bottom side back room is going to be starting leashless on his red eye where is Natalie who already has the much faster clear is going to get a lie so this is going to kind of slingshot clothes are quite a bit ahead of the potluck already and I want to see if he can get anything done on this first clear if you can try to steal away some pants if you want to try to invade early toward that blue but perhaps they have a ward thereI like the t's crossed and I's dotted by Mortals here at the early game potluck drops his Ward down early on a photo with Red Bluff right as 1:30 comes around Joey drops went down as well to make sure he's not doing red to blue red to invade should say unit 3 and bottom side to be available if there is a skirmish down there I mean Leon a record is very volatile xayah and therapy and don't have a states are we out of the game pretty constant is okay we know what happened we see link chickens we know closures Pathak was a full clear bottom side a by the way top who in this being so close to going to be up there in about 20 seconds get ready for that potluck to be smart things by the flu and drop the same time but they still far right now play Immortals meu expecting they are professional players here but right now it's hey be careful because as soon as I can be a big fight and we'll have to see how toHunan just wait right because he did bounce the first wave now ideally I think he just wants to let the wave no push against them and then perhaps if the big back way before you protected on the dive but you need this way it's actually come out and somebody has a frozen at that pretty much the perfect spot because I was in the spot where he wants to get it fully reset but it's kind of stuff in the position and it could be a pretty rough play WoW pretty important to a flash gold card would never do anything you would just cleanse perfectly and still get away so there's no real need any way to stop him get too late for the first game for the game still a full six Camp clear from Italy Top Gun available taken as Politics the bottom side and do you know the first few games do not come through but we are sitting in the hundred thievesabout the map at the very least they reset the wave and they can actually Zone to Huong off some of this you can see that he's missing out on all that experience you have engagements Bottoms Up Rico's back for a Joey and realistically so much durability because of the power of Guardian work on G+ powerless Chuck just don't do a whole lot at top right now but maybe you can keep this Lane in a spot where someday we'll get the night it's going to go to the turret. But I guess I'm going to have a tank that wave in front door to hold you going to keep the farm going and if you know the jungler could be up there it's always risky because you know at that point someday as half-elf can you can't break them down as a, even if you just get send up by Renekton and Spirit by Majid Ali and nothing else happens besides that that's a big chunk on your help right after you TP backed up saloon alreadybehind off of that initial play and he did miss out on something experience as a wave crashing now the wave is again pushing away from him this is you know he's involved back pattern as you were talking about how pretty is grass, he is going to your first we'll see exactly where he does go after that but for now and you want to be staying ahead in in the enchanter vs. melee matchups because they can get to the point it when they get some sustained on someone like this Renekton where they're just sustaining through all your damaged or ignoring everything you're doing and then they have full control of him Lane and their name is getting power Q Sunday still by head over all you can see CS equal but you got an extra 7cs to take in front of him so we are suspecting step today to win this Sunday he's going to win Paisley every lane I can't wait to see the El Faro game is on the line that's going to be a fun but I think in the future but we've got closer so incredibly active looking for athe closer season this is why it would happen to the top of the table is that was perfect a double knockout from who he as soon as that didn't get flash it just felt like a mortal's was accepting their death I think the call was there's no way we can actually get out of this heat of Muses he'll neither of them use their flash they accept their defeat but it is the devil kill going over to closer it separately ultimate highly effective here from Devante this was just perfectly done as a Carrera love into the corner here keeping Joey stacking up as they try to retreat and who he find that point blank double knock up the gold car was already there a tank of the tower they realize they can read I've but they reset the aggro first of the month I can have it on him a train not going to have any risk of getting killed off there in the re dive and that was justWallace from hundred thieves have a bot Lane worth playing to Ward then they're doing is perfection really beautiful stop snow 1600 top late is already winning bottling certainly going to be winning now and hang clothes I got to kill so that his pockets he's going to be bigger than potluck going to win model who plays going to be available Keith is farming a CS is okay and and one thing I will say that is positive is divided the back of the double kill went in Italy 6 so his experience is not really been set back whatsoever closer hasn't really done any counter jungling eBay do something now but potluck has just been comfortably farming and the early game for hecarim is pretty garbage you do in a lot of games that broke Leo C hack Rim in this type of match up really kind of help back having that little sick delay the fog has gotten there he's not going to win the scrimmage as you saidin time he'll have the ultimate online if you have double enchanters behind him and there is potential still for him to be very very effective but you know Mortals are going to have to be able to even find those two fights because phytochemicals pick it up there could be about that and give the ghost is Popeye potluck but there's not going to be a battle so he's going to stay alive but we're going to lose some of your throat as you walked
