sadly have filled and lit games a lot they have nearly taken down swings and they've gotten turned around either way but it's still going to be fun to watch for if they can attack and then hold on to the game with all these players are Dark Horse brand new to the LCS topside their first games were just last week and they're going to keep going for here will any of those at the board Galley also follows kind of scared strategies and this this chair champion pool does get taken out early on in the first draft days actually I will I will give you upI think this is going to rise a priority do on super drunk Lane matchups individual match up there so there's this might actually give a nice advantage over 284 to pick your breather tube mate or someday I would prefer that they save it for Sunday actually it's montoya's played very versatile roll either running around with a demon it was one of those aggressive pics or also being able to play orianna in somebody's control Mages I think he gets overlooked in that aspect of passed through through a looking at Niles game so far he's been really high Farm junglas where if you don't listen to you but you take more camps that's okay you're still doing really really well Champions like Thalia and Graves at least it's not that brings the gun is when he played it earlier but it'd be at least like that is a get stuff done for your team kind of champion is kind of in between the two where they can just feel reasonably wellopen things like a redacted possibly in the top way that's the big thing to me Renekton still went through champ select here and we're talking about strong lanes that is one of the strongest that you can pick as why can't a couple as well he's actually wanted to get into that super early on his face though I don't think they they necessarily need to Niles of course don't for the grave or a note for the gang you at one point was a gangplank one-trick so that's still available so very high priority if you have an Italy pick your though I think you kind of need to deny Renekton cuz no matter what. I was fixing that case is going to be under too much pressure already these Basics update one of the best I've got the best top laner endoleaks if you have to baste a Renekton Italy combo and that is pain that is going to be a lot of pain it is so set gets locked in now brakes this Shield so if u w 1st to get pretty screwed it is a fakefrom who you know what can be played pretty complicated support or in topland I'm still a big fan of set-top limited it is quite good there's nothing that we defected to see that you know you okay this is more of this and it yet you know it's kind of like Lee Child Support so will drop the GP off right now okay let's see what else they want to whittle down here on Niles honestly maybe the gragas sit one of those safer fix watch regeneration four-lane gragas roaster priority and Top Lane as one of the general is fixed because she does so much damage and so you can push waves and get harassment a lot of these melee matchups what's a super safe with body slam you could always save it for either engaging setting up with your jugular for 6 rate disengage to along with the ultimate Being Sober quotes out if you know like you're postulating this is a support set rotation here that they pick past you know it looks like a hundred thieves definitely think I'm on those lines I prioritize that have been more I support right now let's see what I lacked with final report will be the Dallas Stars with my inclination here as well although he is one of the players will actually plug-in chanter supports forever does so you're never safe Franklin Lane out you're in bed playing like defensive Ciroc with Relic Shield of that doesn't feel very good so it is just take bands going away delete allister up that is an easy snap peas 1 record have been limited to do that and then save the rest for counter and indeed they say you are so excited here mate on a collie everyone always talks about Demonte yeah you know he's this loic on Mid laner not good at Lane matchups always runs for the team that's what makes them good I love seeing him on Assassin's melee Cari Champion if we get to mate here on the akali some some early pressure you get it for the level six comfortably that is so fun to watch Lilia is a great Target for a colleague afelius is an amazing Target for a college 100% of 0 we got the set that can move around so now I'm partying have their lineup in the out to go to the thing is for sure that I acted is one of the very few counter picks because it is so precarious if a protected get that early Gakuen protecting gets even though the owl play early on on the Quints and blows Summoners and even just something as little as the cleanse is blowing like a level 1 or something like that that would be hugely detrimental to the Quinta Quinta needs to play this match up very offensive Lee you constantly push the redacted off the waves oradexon can't build up rage you get your brush control everything comes with playing aggressively it for the Quin side if you lose that then you lose the entire point of the pic so a lot of your team play has to also revolve around that you know jungle pathing as well as wording but bad I love it the confidence to we are talking about iconic in the intro but also Niles came into the ALCS there like you don't want we're coming straight from Collegiate skipping Academy everybody doubts us everyone things were hard place to farm really well in week number one tactic when he's going to try play aggressively is going to try and take it to some day good luck it's going to be a lot of fun Niles has planner there of course has a long-standing history playing alongside I caught played in Maryville for quite a while with stop gofer jungle poaching and get a lot done there on the Lily we'll see how we can write The Closer on is Italy but we are on the Ripper this one it's going to be a fun one to watch for once again hundred these pinlock first place in their group those records are swept by the way how the thieves are two-in-one they locked first send a group with a win here Golden Gardens typing wanted to they are already guaranteed to be in the playoffs themselves that they beaten CLG but they can't I T L these Auntie sent it two wins and find ourselves in a high-speed as a result depending on how the games go without waiting now for the first place that's appreciate it let him get the w2w instantly clear set of an owl statues of the knock back there I'm able to defend his Ward plus get a nice lead and Lane it's going well already freaky on Sunday you have no reason to walk to that brush their they let you like really really trying to make the wave push like you you can play it from a different side and you know what does not loop after health bar but as it is dial just playing very far up he is denying Farm in pretty back for a little bit but so far so good up there it's about like half past your screen to spend it depending on your resolution and what you play at so it's going to be different for everybody but that was out of range for experience when he got them up to the base of the truth are so now it's a plane it's really well at the opening as you said someday playing a little bit so carelessly they're taking the extra trade of chunk of damage. I'm going to trade you should get anything with the minions but he is getting real squishy already if you work through the potion and Whittle down already the Renekton that takes away so much of the threat even of the game, topside you know both junglers are looking at this matchup has the most of the entire map that does hinge very heavily on gangster what kills Alex message text Quinn not running teleport because she has to run twins to get out of the combos first translate here often times makes a difference but someday Canon minion wave stacked up in here for Niles so he's able to earn with the pressure he put out already safety himself and that will buy time for iconic to finished his clear on Lilia what you absolutely love with a Chance again you want your full clear first before you start interacting with the Lay's then you can easily and cautiously get to your Scuttle crab pick up so honestly really good start here for the conference for Golden Guardians what about the mid lane damage to Face by Sunday could have you know - W-2 because if you did anything at all you just lose the entire way but that works cleanse to get out anyway exactly that the cleanses the big kicker here you're not going to get that kill on the first pass and so you're giving up more than a single wave there was an extra minion in addition to the Candy Man and so I'm pretty sure they were almost late so yeah so is a huge amount of gold that you're giving over in an attempt just to burn the summoner's put to give up your positioning and probably take damage on the way back Sunday walking from the bakery in the body slam iconic what bear is the thing like you was there they could have gone for Bodyslam your like Silver Eyes baby if I put her something but decided now it's not the flight when do the interesting things to do to track in League of Legends or aggravating depending on your point of view is the priority of CC abilities because some CC abilities will override others braccus is at the top of the list for almost over writing all forms of other gases and CeCe abilities if you body slam you gain priority maybe it's cuz he's such a big boy you definitely interrupt Alistar W so there's no way you should ever be getting destroyed by it and I'll start there that's one of the reasons who he goes for the counter pick year for their progress it's it's really good in situations like that and it's even you even can win out on stuff that you don't like Warwick ultimate is supposedly Unstoppable and yet it loses things like trivial hook shots and stuff like that so honestly it was probably had like a public free related to your lure of your Champion or something Alright lyrics from the railyard a man who could ever stop the body sensor is a play the top side pillow 512 the same decided that flash of power. He was also know play well done there I I'll catch that what I like it's been laying a Colles main goal is usually to get to level six. You have your your big spike in until pressure and as you can see them out they had rushed for sort shoes so he also is looking for targets like Lilia and possibly even bottom line or Top Lane roams these are all viable kill targets for a collie really squishy Champion boy outfits too much everybody except his land upon its plays all of that he's looking to try to take advantage of fear but sort shoes definitely give you the extra Mobility. around around and you still have really good verse damage you know with your ultimate with your spell penetration Trace back and forth are the most of the Will Downing plays Oliver the wise though pretty close to see if there is fine work trezor not going to do anything to ask you guys against those two facings for who he is mostly the knock back and not that much of a cyst on butt be there a minor importance Day stuff for Sunday me the pretty good trade overall in Niles you have to cut away from this one Concord Police act up with Autos come back through Mazurek Reeves and he's going to feel reasonably okay stop Google Assistant back office closer to take the blue Power Ranger Through the Jungle the right plan for this Lane we had to earlier point where they don't want to sacrifice any of those early minions for the force attempt on to be Quinn and he's just rushed is steel caps with his store and shield has been able to see very very good numbers for PS4 Renekton Quinn matchup it can be way worse than that especially if if the jungler on the side of the Quin is nothing more aggressive than a Lilia it way way way way worse right now the way this in a little bit extra range meaning there so he's fine with the back porch them iconic will take that chance though to start up the Richfield police scouted to be no problems either 3000 help it is Quinn Shelton top comes down three B-24 now he carries want to go over to be their first duty is already on the way unless you win this fight fight this going to be a hero
