but it moves you see that building up these minion wave going for dyed keeping up the pressure proactive Play constantly looking to progress their game State Court there wind conditions and coming to game number for here let's see if they can close it out or if Cloud9 could force the decisive game at number five as we build up towards the end of the lock-in tournament this weekend now the band has been fairly similar we got some changes here with a case of finally being taken off the table which of these now on the blue side as well as the your native Brooks has gone back to yep to Leah right now is up with the debate is up Cloud 9 but you know what to Ponte pants don't work till just play Rise and we just rather get rid of some of the Sunday Champions problem is Camilleif we on the table though many will pick this one off and that means he's going to be really comfortable on a very very strong ad jumper and you are going to really have to worry about Twisted Fate as well okay, I already jumping on a day if seen this before from hundred thieves walk in to leave early on they always try and follow it up with a du-rag a Leo or a Twisted Fate so that you had CC set up from your Midland you also can transition to the other parts the side lengths does Bill a very flexible roll for the squad can go into the Camille can be Flexin to support role for who he is well he's been extremely good at creating plays with it they do have to worry about their bottom Lane pick your 480 Carey cuz it's Twisted Fate play it's going to be looking for that perfect Camille can transition to picked as well so you probably are going to be forced to do a cleanse Bic for FBI here considering you do you know they're going to have Vulcan on TCC as wellalmost certainly that the metagame really is you know teams are just picking hard rock and roll down at the port at Cave reduce the enchanted up those teams are going for that one there is definitely going to be a support who beat the band away the second phase so often if either grab a movie is on I would say is most comfortable support support I think it's great that support actually was what. Who he recognized last year and really started Propel him for stardom for the support role extremely good at utilizing the next flash plus extra speed to chase down people set up voice for the depot. I'm really excited about is the jack big again for someday fry number to a little bit of redemption in early game last time didn't receive a lot of attention and was picked on did not take advantage of the exact advantage over Camille single match up in the top side of the map where one of the big things about Camille in your trading pattern in Lane is trying to get your auto attack offrock your Shield or your dad is shield with Dax the biggest part is of course your Counter-Strike you can't get your auto attack off working me up so you never get your Shield frog and he tasted you. He automatically wins at trade with a difficult things to work around and your Bump back on your hook shot it's not long enough to bump him out of the car strikes done range until he has a really good trump card and a lot of these trade pics level six that really becomes a brute to try and try and handle but and isolation that can be a strong theme for the rest of this graph a compliment that because apparently Cloud Nine already sitting on global pressure which with the state makes that difficult to take advantage of Camille can do a whole lot more than half as well of course but it seems like a lockdown Incredible 2 combo with CF very very good. Games pretty reliably was hookshot going over walls to make that happen so can be a tough one they are we do not have tank right now in the Cloud 9 sign there might be brokenone is Misfortune is locked in here for the counter picks down there had a deep when I lock in the rest of their bottom line is I got to figure out what they want to play a lucky composition again I think I had those were pretty well I get the app for adults as you just dodged a gold card and the rest of I can go pretty okay to run cleanse because you can dodge that for you can dodge come deal with it as well as the old lady here that goes on targetable so if you are trying to look through Camille it is indeed that and we're going to get that gal you made that we expect it out of the month as a result once again they're going to be looking to have him support those two side land someday FBI the big carries hear from is actually a pretty good Pick 4 for trying to shut down you'll popping up the wall being able to place of space as well with your ultimate to work with Misfortune but it might be here does put even more problems into piloting the jacks orLeon because both you can get out there to Rome and with his own ultimate can have a long-range plays to set up for these glasses in the Pittsburgh Twisted Fate 590 going very pick heavy this time around they are giving up a decent amount of what they have invested in early on in this series in all of the support of pics with Moonstone or neutered feeling you up they want to get picked and they want to get kills with them I just chimed in real quick cuz they're on TV are not swapping so we thought it was going to be who he playing is tried-and-true set support it is set in mid for the mate the galio goes down to Ubi I love the flexibility because you look at me like that but they're going the other way around here it's going to be fun to watch to see how that one plays how could certainly fat kittens with Santi of pressure pretty well the Legend So High in Tiffin truly poke you out of Lane and garlic is going to make the plays in The End Zone people out as well so I should be a very fun to watch for yeah and it it doesn't mean it is going to be a little bit difficult on bottomI facing a Bard MF Lane early on we'll see how much pressure they can actually retain in Lane this might change how they try and set up you know for the early stages for this River control around dragon and if you're actually going to be sending so much attention to the Jacks Camille matchup do you want to finish screen right now game 4 is about to begin with right now going to be exciting battle between these two giant teams in the LCS and lock in coming to a close this weekend the 1st of my finals when are watching right now people knew how did things versus Cloud9 was probably be closer of the two semifinal and Christine I finally got themselves a win in game 3 we're hoping the game for it to be Justice clothes I do not believe how do these was spotted on the way but now it's been will be seeing goes for the Monte he will eventually catch the van I think even despite the W will get a range for the pull back and I'm not quite so good job has been holding on to a skill point wi was take a while to ramp up gets out of range and time and no harm no foul funny cuz it is plenty of Steel yourself at thumbs up from both sides of course you know ghost as a very local down so you often see your people popping their ghosts in these level ones because you have so much exit I'm still for a 4 meeting to come to Lane probably won't be taken advantage of in the slightest but it did give the window for that Ward over on Blue buff that fight was able to get a little bit deeper and work so they know when is the percent for sure closer starting spot on red and can't see the transitional. As well so pretty normal leasing on both sides close to going for somewhat of a full clear here at the Red Bluff going to not burn Smita this one probably on the crugs is the Autos knock that one down dueling show up it's pretty much full information and you wouldn't go to Lane late just a fake delete it's not really worth that so we know where the counter strike is going to block the grasp of the undying trigger and said they would still rather Auto one extra time but look at that good place Live Oak in had a couple of Health packs down there already knew topping is volatile wanted to give him help over to fudge to make that late a little bit nicer than nice play right there yeah and he's also pushing because you know that you have bottom style side start to Leah so he can transition up to the top side to make sure you don't get your picked off early on punished for this pushing and again it's it's the stages before level 6 where Camille can you actually gain control a it's Jack's if you're if you're able to W at work around The Counter Strike opportunities but it gets really really difficult with a brute force that Jack gets when he gets at level six extra passive damage as well as being a little talk to your ultimate after The Counter Strike so that even after the short trade you have a lot of answers for the long trade to judge anybody gone for the fact that he's only took the single potion has a house party lead in a stocking crafts with the S Telegraph me so late. Too bad for him some paper to check through all three Graphics tax though and now here comes apart because the lady has turned around Sunday burn his health pool to get the wave pushed into that it would fail to meet bladder has to be this out of that because he's already swept from the ward in try Rush he's playing for Scuttle crab and there is no dive now onto fudgy cannot be gank they know the time goes around bladder past pretty successfully to get tough schedule coming off even more of closes options yes indeed jewelry colored on the bottom side now it's going to be that more waiting. A little bit less aggressive from Sunday that we're looking for towards level six to spike it right back up closer than all the way back down to bottom side knowing with that black purple priority on the top camp with the push and Camille plus the quicker clear for himself is Rick always seem so you have a timing there and you can a factor in 40 seconds into him being right back on the map Italy is actually a little bit faster because of the passive but that's General Your Mark early game before people upgrade to their two tier two boots boots picked up as well of course yeah the one nice thing to also keep in mind as we're kind of tracking closer a spectator the cloud has tracking them as players if they also know they started bottom side then later they literally see the lease but they could you know track that from The Outfield across the game shorter Cole and Savannah smell burnt toast as well but the knowledge was there that okay indeed closer is about size start he's going to be on crutches going to go over that the Raptors and bladder order Little Five Night be here for a bit of a play as a person Vulcan are here to make it as long as he's safe to get to shut the wave out and that should before you like it should read that I think to Captain will not break that being freeze things that who he does because he's been so good in Gage's later on that play right there was made because he goes for a timing that you don't expect both bottom line supports recalling but he skipped his base immediately up Fords Midland instead of going for the base first so it's a decent timing on the support topside though can't going off of slow at least but just going to be true of War going to find this done the Dodge. he almost drop someday nearly had a margin but it's not going to happen here comes a fly from Detroit getting away is who he and spent do I grill pulled no harm no foul to lose weight though. They got a little pressure off Einstein with the extra showing on top but man that killed was so close someday had successfully escaped but wanted to finish off that one with his died inside Tower range that is calculated no problem Odyssey. Pretty pretty comical event as as he has set himself up someday you play The Escape really well you know that that's the way to go and then he turns around looking for the final turn around and kill why we're going to sustain off of the extra potion as well doesn't quite get it couple extra damage there but it is it is going to significantly change he had been doing so well early on with the Jacks part of it pushing in a little heavily on fudge and retaining what we seen for most of the series where he's had the upper hand nice little bit of relief provided by bladder even if it was risking close end of the day it's still an XP and gold bleed for Sunday the 20s is more than enough to make up for the lack wave 200 gold and here comes the squad closer and who here there but don't worry focus there as well with a twist of fate of the top it's going to push back the second one comes across and it's still a great like to do on 459 big support plays for a good bulking heads over so quickly with The Bard and chance to laugh when we're talking about affecting the topside match up his transitional period here with Bart's so quick to cross the map with the ultimate from Twisted Fate again Cloud 9 are investing more into topside more into fudge more into an area of the map that they have had as a weakness for most of the series and it's been good and yes the top one is still going you know Sunday favorite events that they both got to kill their Sunday still up in farm but Cloud 9 are there to answer every time volkans already here TSN trade for the old me to get so high trapeze date whenever you see them build up a to Stacked wave like this you have to think or at least have some answers in place to deal with the dive and this time around Cloud 9 in mediately close the Trap you mention it Twisted Fate Vulcan immediately there it's still it's pretty closing and start to see somebody try to fight his way out of it they still get a kill four hundred thieves someday does get some of the gold there so I guess what you pass level 6 now level 7 with the extra see isolated and got the
