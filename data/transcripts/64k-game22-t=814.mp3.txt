really you can absorb some people put them or they made things actually scale off of your radius bike Saint Pius giving out your radius and things like show gas attack range in malpais brown Slam in his ultimate like the more that actually does apply for what your character sizes but then it sucks because we're just getting to the really big tank by doing their armor stacking about go a bit better so it's on you know you can call the city of ether their support is being replaced but otherwise game jerseys that as they play through the summer split of CB loftswell is getting bad and I like we've got soda and where our City's old is Donnie passing themselves r o r o I don't think there's anything there but you got licorice yeah I mean broxah had a run in the tournament didn't go as far but liquor is he was playing way more 1G ones than anybody else in the ALCS before so I'm having a great time here already warmed up for the update I think that heats hendro both the man with the most enthusiasm for Brazil in the team is going to be going head-to-head to the guy that has just had some really pop up games I think the one he had against Catholics against a boy with Cassiopeia was the most exciting one do you want we had so faryeah it doesn't. Right here early since ever I like that liquor certification Ali I wouldn't blind the Champions League singed I don't think you may be in League of Legend lights up there a little bit as well but when this is this is how can you counter him if he Proxes your lane every time if he's always proxying the counter never is there T-Mobile I think was one of the hardest counters against AIDS and he's already gone so I think this is licorice is saying bring it and he brings forth the tank that we still don't really know how good he could be with something like the Ken tank now that is it's a real cool looking at it well I will say if you want to build the bilge is Riley's first Imperial mandates secondchunk of the side that one of the chances I can do pretty well in the preheated overall do deer is outstandingly strong twitch got a bunch of bus in the most recent patent which is totally viable there's a good chance it's a Pete which we be twitch jungle and put support a little bit as well with you you're locked in Autumn expect which jungle supports which is good but the possibility now more words Champion gear wants to face again so you could ever done anybody it's actually quite that it might be nice cuz you did get the bookI haven't seen it lately cuz that I knew it before with the old lady banging the new one I'm not sure how it's going to work out but you're actually playing someone that has to run at you against who wants you to run that a man you can't even tell him now that you got black shield to protect them so I don't know what this bear is thinking about but if anything level two gangs early game fights have been the motto for All Stars everything a year did time maybe 50. Flash Bears left once again 2 level 2 classic we get Lucian mid as well since I don't expect it is actually the Bible are they expecting Morgana support and so we're waiting to see what midday number going to be for the LDS projected abraxa meanwhile for CV long we're looking for a top laner Reddit supportK means they're banning out the wrecks I so that's going to be pretty useful for twists not wanted to give away his stuff and then the mouth is just so good against double a Visa Yankee composition has a good chance of succeeding in it that already has given me a bit of a buy it there cuz the more dank a team comes up with those are the ones you want to see when you want to see what can they come up with that is just so off the wall but still Victorious a brand France speak to me afterwards you got to be to damage output one thing that's really nice is since we ever really seen the brand update Both Worlds it is really easy to get like a 13-minute sightstone because you see the back line it will still spread to the other enemy Champions evil and attack them with ve and also the passes to get 30 gold right awaybecause they buff to those filthy Simcoe to be worth more money over also you have to just get a huge influx of cash while playing brand support you're going to be rich and recites known as you're going to sleep pretty early on and also as we get rakan and Tristana locked in that is gray and I also want to add to your brand brand doesn't support is the kind of champion that you can go 0 and 15 and still do more damage in your 80 carry at the end of a gap which is I think the valley that you're getting out of him run it down doesn't matter if you're providing all the damage no Dairy sleeping really really heavy traffic into sin to look at so lucky with like a 55-45 the game is 5545 D cause of the magic play Soul a Christian had a really hard time you mentioned earlier crumbscannot Lane against Ghost wife. Soda level one in base level 1 invade is the best way to ensure that you get a side of the map controlled and then you can start practicing a Non-Stop we've seen it happen in the lck Matt said yesterday where teens were just send the night Crossing each other in the jungle it could happen here again to level one of their quite powerful with all the routes and Flash done that can be delivered to this weekend work on a bit of course you saw his real work on with the eventual Watkins so it is going to be a fairly safe Midland or going for primarily waveclear what I saw in champ select and maybe they swapped out for the timer was that tactical was on the recording for Jake day was on the Ezreal if you want the LEC All Stars they have rolled swap once and then another time afterwards it was I who played his own role as you can see that indeed is going to be going back he's going back to his roots was formerly from about later played in the lck played on dignitas in the LCS went back to the lck the mystery role swap to supportand went and you know what the World Finals than one world to support on Samsung Galaxy here we go invade begins flash knock a big damage find plane goodbye at 5 around to rock jumps Lowe's 3in brtt time to run away tattoo go to heaven W pretty soon call JJ's on the board again they're Relentless their tactical knew exactly what to do you think or JJ do the flash knock of way too many times did not go for it himself and he was going to happen they saw it coming but the branches did not expect that will quickly blcs reacted forgot to Jungle that's the part I did not know more jungle was a thing I got to correct myself on that one I got to see if it's even pop of the road to pick rate in solo queue is critically low top play it's not bad so it was run a few games in a cademy the ALCS last split so there are sometimes where you can run it to clear is decent I mean what you're really trying to do is get out of gambling and get grouped with the team right that's what you want for you to Morgana anyway then I just respect the fact that they actually squish the real cuz the Champions look so standard but the roles and who is playing who actually makes the Champions more exciting broxah course losing time as carrier runs around and is going to be counseling topside they are and should be hard to find a kill that you can fly every time a good email use after is letting them know that this is a big waste of time and do deer mean on the top side just farming away just having a good old time making sure that is Buddy Darius can do whatever he wants up against it sent you has yet to touch a single cream help all that much if you can't Triple A baccarat that's worthwhile but I think it's so unlikely that you get any pressure because you can't force a full Health Center's to die but yes all three cans going to go to the topside rocks play for his team. End early control board in front of them blue and you can see it on the map is a controller right above carryout and that means that box I can go and take a bunch of his own camps you can kind of match camp for the most part I will see how it plays out in the crisper solution about what they want to watch for for sure two knowns the easy MVP of the CP law will see what I can get done but we are getting all three camps Abraxas so no cancer being lost yet and no cancel. But then it's a jungle Morgan that is not a carry junglers I would put all my eggs in the voted best player of the sea below here but I think Gage from Jensen. He is not having a good time he has ever get out of here yep GIF the first I thought I was sparked by Jensen you need if you get the flu shot off on Tristana if you explode the charge you get a reset on Rocket Jump kill or not it's not allowed him to get a bit more done right there he'll flash burn brtt spell shield comes down in time anyway and yeah you got to walk to wait for this one is really looking for the opportunity that to get that kill the flash of need and walks away is that is brtt for the shots that is a painful one over Diamond Tactical from Cibolo looking for the tier stand up flash bear slap you got no help you trying to run you try the one as soon as long as backup he's got this if you got poison licorice founded with the poison and takes it down so worth it though they wasted so much for that Midland plant Ginseng with a slick flash over the wall that's really the key play he making the Flash and buffering the Rocket Jump just it's so much for him they did not expect that he is going to be so prepared for that be safe so that felt like a little bit over over cost but you still can't hate on the fact you got to kill you forth with her out just the same been going to survive cuz of that and it looks like it's e v Lola is just still in this and why Relentless remember the early game was so brutal in your account organic this is it this is what they want Eazy by now but they can't re-engage the Gutierrez around at at something really low on health run away but carefully walks into tank Decor at The Runaway going to explode the damage here we just going to be okay and help us are running low if you don't land the engages bring a wave is so fat they really want to commit to it and they have no way of diving in if you saw how old is Ray Morgan I interacted this whole time it was the saddest thing I've ever seen for a new deer jungle he was chasing her from the top of her own Lane Tree buying dinner just not able to close the cap this is just a really sad bear this whole game and he is so slow you actually have to hope that you can get ahead and then start Max in your barracks laugh so that you can start moving around the jungle faster and chasing down two people that are a kite you could damage that they are nice little pillar of flame there. Phil gets himself some healing available if you can see us getting a very brief respite but let's 36 256 in csuf liquor got to roll off hey well done good job but I mean came in a lane with two free assist with an extra gold and you know he's down for UPS with a wave to be claimed I just got to be rough but he's read the proxy he's got him at the items you got to swim with pretty easily I think it is straight of outrun level 1 DARE stand 2 tier so licorice has a bit of room to play with yeah is that way they catch him even know what they're all in this top side of the Jungle Book just can't bother dealing with it he's just a big fly in the side and this is beautiful this is exactly what you want to see an exeggcute to just he might give it to you in a way it's closed because like Brandon's nearby he'll get the whole wave and a half a little for that and ensure yes the waves are all gained yeah slippers able to get you know I promised though he wasn't having a wedding is Darius but that is not to be given away which is beautiful you don't think it was worth it I think you kind of have to do it anyway but you are trading gold for experienced right upright it's gotten but you just gave reacted to support like those are those are relevant costs to trade off that's a totally is it you're just hoping that the brand continues to die okay okay it was a known proxy, but that was that was really not to kill at all there is no flash fares up available I think he's got a rocket
