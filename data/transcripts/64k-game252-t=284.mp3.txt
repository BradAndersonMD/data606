mobility of this Champion creating chaos sharing gold changing matchups and we are in a champions for the last we are in the game 1 of the NBA Finals Team Liquid taking on G2 Esports and what shocks me already was he was on the receiving end in 96% of their game of the Tariff and it's sealed themselves actually dropping off the table so I take that back we do have the car so it is G2 with the galio the tack and the rise band fascinating do they actually look to take that one away typically when we could playing on the right side on to denying that rise take away from their oppositesso successful for G2 so it's so weird to see each team batting those two Champions out and leaving up the junglers but take a look and there is going to be the first one blocked in so much success drive this tournament that have the ability to make the early games impact on the different lanes and again I want to reiterate the rabbit has been updated shoes blue stripe for game one as was there right at the higher seed this is Wonder taking the job and bring it out of that prioritizes outside of the map in the semi-finals that usually went through the Solace into jungle pick was that be the wreck side the job and and sometimes even this Ghana but this time I not have Lisa gets through the galley should be the priority to the midgame invite is a huge part of the identity of Team Liquid speaking of identity going to log into Skynet this was the champion that he used to get that full steam victory over Invictus gaming taking it into the right side of buying a lot of success and I think Team Liquid Spigen want to go Tom can share cuz they were afraid of these iatric on Duo and they have the option to pay recana very big pic for Mickey X looks best when he is on the grass so we can go forward start the team fights perks of course really good on this is alongside of the player when he was a minute later would still play Sia and get funnel on it certainly a lot of expertise was camping this is a from your bottom line for the second round couple of power Pick 3 or 4 g2a biggest moments for this player has been on that can create other reasons babies are kind of alluded to possible way from Tom came after the recording you know with a charm up you can collect multiple members who does have to be a little bit careful of the burst damage coming out of the other side and often times will see teams that are against work on especially in the mid lane grass some of that first name if you're trying to kill him upon initiation because that is the weakness of the champion bit squishy I'm looking to take away some of the safe takes that impacted Austin defaulted to the cannon being the main one they may look to take away the Gangplank but he didn't actually played a single time in a best-of-five again Invictus gaming we'll see what she look to take away off the board maybe they look to take away Jensen singer or if they consider a big threat considering as well if we are going to see Mages the route in the mid lane here once on a band for G2 Esports how good is there homework what do they think Team Liquid woodpec to best round out the composition of Vladimir is off the table at impact Elite plays long-range face laners who don't need help to get away from the one be Tuesday and then Flank In the team fights the Cannons the bladder and the Nikko all prime pick for him are gone exactly those big ability 14x have been the common thread in Impact pics of a couple of last bands they're on the side of G to try and take that away but it goes right back to where he started in the group stage in fact the single best performing player of the liquid Gangplank was a Mainstay tries to save space on the top side in a big difference between gameplay and they can endure Vladimir is that the ultimate can be committed without having to use your telephone to the other side of the map now we see the Swain coming out from G to expectations all of this will be put up towards the top side this is something we saw from here last year and was a very common ancestor thing like the Jeep in the forecast this came out yesterday against the side of cats and he was able to have a huge amount of impact on the counter pick possibility here for Jensen in the middle and give him the reason for their win over IG was Camp rookie he's a good player he can carry us through that strategy did work and now how is Saint Vincent's number one signature pick is here in game 1 of the final figure from G to such a good defense against Garner make it so you don't have to pay those qss packs is quite as quickly and quite as Focus their the Black Shield such a good defense all free will see how they get through the early game here because again my eyes turned towards the top side this Wayne picked for G2 seems to be one of the most advantageous points my expectations that both teams that she looked to invest a lot of resources outside the map I wouldn't be surprised to see Yankers that you make a level to play and see if they can fight off the Cyrus on The Voice for yank us will he go for the bottom side like you're talking about or try and dive the gangplank I got to see after game 1 of Champions left a best-of-five there are at least two more drastic of we're hoping it goes all the way to that face game is on the 10 players hands now you hope the guidance you gave him was enough you hope their practice got them ready for this event this will be the first ever major championship for North America in the first free Europe since 2011 G2 are the new ones the hole that mantle in Europe in Team Liquid or Built For This and we are on to the Riff that headless trophy in that soft lanes that head will be replaced at the conclusion of his peers of one of those immortalized by 2019 I didn't want to rebel in a couple more seconds for the fact that merely us being here now in this finals D2 and Team Liquid have for the entire competitive League of Legends theme into a paradigm shift u n n a fighting for everything upgrade my Mac O B I like it according to the W is coming up soon they could look for play unspooled a date. Flash Barry early on questionable decision making that from call JJ waiting in the members are coming to get washed and then having to blow your flash for it North America already on the losing end your of the level one but t l Osborn Lane will be able to get priority in this to visit Cuba and Mickey. Assist in terms of the early jungle advantage that she called it in Dublin right now gang cosas in the river right now settled funds in a few seconds he's already next that brush as well if there is a game to be had and we saw towards to it's not going to be to selfie but if there was a way would be there meanwhile Xfinity clears out the Red Bluff and the rapper tip for heading into the top side Scuttle they will trade after the Visions been given over looks like it's headed towards the Scuttle crab to try and content and does not have the support of his Lanes he has the damage though and with it being stunts metal do bonus damage gets it out before is opposing Junction show up in 53 how often we see the topping was pushed in expectacion is for this match of the exchange of going for the possibility of an early gank look just trying to get down to the felt pads for sale for Yankees versus Mets immediately on Spiner you can annihilate so stay away camps even early on that while you'll notice is that one that running the rest of the undying rosin be typical klepto so we often see a full swing pics for the reason for that is because of how impact lights to PlayStation. It can be difficult could you every now and then you try and hit me with your cue while fun fact I'm going to hit you with mine and you can see how every single time one that's coming out ahead in this place has already passed out as well good training as a g to do oh yeah and good Focus their you want to continue to attack the Tom kench there's no flash Encore JJ as well as whittling down the health bar if you can get through the potions then you can do so much work pressuring and forcing them to lose the edge control word go down for Xfinity in order to clear out some of the G2 Vision but because the bottom line for G2 was able to push their they also get the spires Moon plant and information on the enemy jungler swear about all three lanes right now the Madonna has consistently pushed up in this one versus one it's very difficult for many Mages to trade against the mold because you see the toilets swirl it goes down it pulls the push and the black shield means that you're often going to lose out on these small trades in the way the fact that the level 1/4 Jensen to corrupting potion charges very early on took 90% of his how far end damage off the Invaders from D2 currently we're having a bottom from Yanko in that fog of War right now and he's an upright right there so there is a plate of you had if you're not going to believe it because they playing towards the back of slowest remember there is no security has happened to focusing on that weakness that they opened up in the level one attacking corejj no flash on that's on catch first but 42k we see the setup janko's comes in from the lane double at the Gorge expected to be present to the river which is why they were bringing down and notice how they completely ignore what you were just saying it Cody wanted to let themselves first one Dan Katz walking up past the minion fear I don't look right to throw out the arrow get the flash off of the 80 karrie as well great fly out of G through have a custom Dallas well there's no Ward on the target with Logan's in the back and it looks like for now we see free call pedrito can't be stopped there are more than a prostrate positioning that from corejj to keep his 80 carry alive 6 Minute mm is 2 goal lead as they find multiple successful trade with caps does for the shield on a lane with a disaster for Team Liquid that has gone on the bottom side key to our continuing to keep up his pressure double it's on the war here Kidde recall up with AJ still far up in the lane so as soon as it complete Kinkos in PDX know they can go for this and notice how close to Atlanta to just go back to base and Wanda is waiting for the potential TPS impact immediately comes in at this point xmithie an impact realize they can't play split apart and they get away with what minimum one member because doublelift does not have teleport on the berit and they forced him back to base so even if teleports go off they will always be answered and she too is able to take advantage of those numbers and I'll get you a key West woah push the start of the game system so I am at Safeway's constantly getting harassed and is full so kind of plan to his current he's not. Overextend without a flash against a level six swaine that already has a very big disadvantage in 1500 gold up watching the trade name on the bottom side yet again it is a relief for the DL side of things but to kill sound of a lot more on 1st and we now have your temper stop playing now comes the cage on top without Flash no easy way out right back trying to run now we're just yet but you're going to play in Ultimate and it might just have the damage always running for dear life, Foresthill of the game Jayco staying on the warpath here because of the bottom Langston and again no flash on impact and he immediately goes to attack it your point it out so wave in a very bad spot pushing away from it games like with no flash is taken down
