importantly this Herman will be dictating if break is going to Flame you or not over the next couple weeks fair to Flame it's like through this is not fair to criticize Celsius be there with flame ever matters where are you I'm I'm helping you get better for example you know dignitas have gotten rid of a lot of the players that were making them lose games and now they're winning games like you know they're going to blast your help them get better CLG I think got rid of players that help them lose games and unfortunately Replacements in in time because of these is going to be fine it's going to be setting it regardless of if we're going to have a lot of good games yesterday and I got to give a lot of freight to impact who of all players yet impact I do think you know he's less hyped than some of their players in any can go ahead and go under the radar a little bit because he has known more for his tag play more for his kind of Bruiser play than like pure carries and had playing around that but yesterday he reminded us that he can play that carry style to that he can build offensively he dominated game on Renekton they're grabbing him that were the first pic here again it's at the well for a lot of junglers in the better right now such a strong blank assistance and even some of the bad matchups there is always the opportunity to flash W's done them set up for your jugular and turn around what does that match ups but I'm going to see if Natalie Renekton is going to be in the meta whatsoever this year because we did see a lot of that at the end of last year but I haven't been seeing you as much newly it seems like in solo queue these days so I will be. See if that pops up was going to be I think second choice if it what is the best thing to Jungle in League of Legends right now I think that's the way you go for this one is back to The Mortals band I think they saw it expected to Lilia is very good show me a pic is is a tier below it that way to put the lily a steel it's like this mess going to play at least maybe not spectrum is is more diving which is Solid V cheat did Black engage I would say in the previous one they play do we are going to be already trying to damage types here comes through impact ignore can start the show and none of them have actually been banned out unless you want to say Pantheon could be a to put in the sport roll so you know you have your allistars you have your Leona's you have even set in some of these other support that can be pretty strong at engaging so it's going to be huge concern for them just yet did Ali has been fairly popular in some of the other reasons so I'm glad to see it popping up here and already has 20 + pics in Pro play so I'm scared teaming up with impact year and this is already something where revenge is going to have to pretty careful about what he is playing a lot of players in this position will just go to a norn and just try to accept a beating and hope that they don't get too far behind I'm going to be able to see if he wants to go for something a little bit more aggressive because there are all options that are considered something like a Quinn even if you are willing to play it and your team is going to play around it but with Lucien coming through I'm expecting that to be a Lucian mid which generally does draw a lot of attention from the jungler so I'm I'm already kind of not really thinking that we're going to have a carry me to carry toffee and I'll carry the jungle Mortals like we are going to have revenge on tank UTI would assume yeah I think it would be a really good choice you're so I'm curious if it going to be a lot of things bands coming through from the eegee's obviously we saw impact do swimming Lee when he kind of classy Oren and then fell asleep so you know maybe he's willing to take those matchups holds on better way it's mortgage going off the bat syndra getting off of the table as well as Lucien is fairly easily that your kind of either yeah it is because when there's an AP junglers well you know how often come through Midway and then you you were really happy generally about going towards the headshrinker and those types of place but that's just maybe more of an attack on to zooga he played this injury yesterday he did look very good on it so you maybe I'll just try to take comfort away from him push him toward something that and that he feels is going to be even better matchup for himself we can see double made fans there in a form of Mortals have one top lamp and taking away than our which is considered to be a pretty good match up into that Renekton in the ones you want of course nor does have to be careful about the jungle assistance but I am expecting you this point forward to probably just be an orphan and ask your question about you or vs. malphite I think both can be fine. Probably going up towards Revenge if we have been seeing quite a bit and I'll p l a c k I think it's a pretty strong pick and a fairly good way to clear because one of the problems that we can see happen to both of the tank that I mentioned what happened yesterday is that wrecked most accurately weighs in at the jungle comes up you get stoned off the tower right in that is what happened to budget for him so far behind you in the early stages of yesterday's game with revenge on Greg perhaps you can just use those barrels early on to thin out the wave enough that he can try to come back that push a little bit more than those tanks may be able to okay Pam here's a Dr Matt Maher you got pretty good CC Channing as well you have to have the prefix but body-slamming at the WM induction breakfast can maybe so I could die so I'm curious if you just got to hold on to that one happy to be ignoring the very very best to pretty solid as well a lot of focus needed with the delete Jen and zoi together team fights like Rowdy vs is going to be maybe a little bit suspect that's the one down to hear the Eevee Squad but they didn't have you did yesterday isn't didn't there was not one for damaged in any way to look really really good The Immortal side of course they've had to currently replace 3/5 of the roster only revenge and Insanity are intended starts everyone else is. Not able to get into the country and play just yet so it's a tough luck but they brought in a bunch of the academy fixing to step up against the team already playing how it taste better than expectations that was already pretty good one easy look really really good yesterday and I do think they have the potential to be much better than the preseason equitation The Wharf and if we can step up because most people are looking at ignore as an upgrade and someone who's placed outfits better with did you get who wants to be aggressive ignorance is known for his wrongs known for his aggressive plays you look up to the top link Kumho vs. impact that seems like a clear upgrade as well but the main question people had was how is Def going to stack up to what thing was for a cheap because bang was huge and so many of the winds for EG out of def camera definitely an excuse me. That can be playing at a very high level you know as good as bang even been finished size limit for the steam they really could go pretty damn far is the team that was honestly have up the prettiest all of threat throughout most of the last year that they came freely close to going to Worlds I had some pretty good playoff runs over off and then yeah what is is leagues better than cumin to or three best supports in league and he's a big upgrade over Azazel there as well and then there's the shoes that you can be filled that belong to bang but if it two lanes are such big upgrades that I mean EGR legitimately a team that can challenge for the food for the throne to challenge for a trophy these the five players I can absolutely do it I'm excited to watch them play out here on the Immortals side of the player I ate and the biggest fan of is insanity I really liked what I saw of him last year getting thrown in and set me as best he could have a very very good player that Lucian mid is as well and yeah I think if you can keep doing well I think it's a it's a career that will keep watching with a lot of sort of excitement because I think he can he can keep getting better and he could be a star and a year or so yeah I definitely agree I'm in there there was so many games in summer split where Insanity was away from being this outstanding memorable game where there was a small Miss execution on the Shockwave for the over push on the azir attempt to try to just knock down the bass these small little moments but I like that he didn't lose his kind of killer Edge right because I do think that was something that that made him stand out is how aggressively he played to really get damaged out in the team fights he played a lot of really high DPS Champions know the carthus the Oriana the is here and he's not afraid to actually throw himself into the fight Stooges maximizes damage output you even if that means he's going to go down that can be worth it if you can get a tremendous amount of damage out so it seemed the development of insanity going to be a lot of fun I thinking already ate twice early on in this land against is UK and just in case is getting pretty darn Loi does have biscuits so we'll be able to start checking those motions but these traits are going very very bad at 4 You Jesus later so far so good and Santa to go to a concert with us when did you could just checking through the two regular potions the first biscuit comes in as well but that of course only does so much so what's it looking like it is for now though a possible formula for joules UK as the push comes into the trait down there nice sized up for Keith ignore walk set fros the hook but they're just out of range no pick up their perfect legs come in and they Siobhan down into this to her there as well as Joey and Keith's up again from the academy roster play as we have seen play in the LCS before but then we are seeing the Australian Duos the normal Stardust here for immortals and eventually we will have them but going to hold out as best they can't I certainly can be quite good and this is a game where I probably wouldn't like to see gale-force I think they're cracking noise when they want more tanks but you got like this game the ability to dodge some of these key engaged tools like Dodge out a hook potentially Dodges fear or sleeve coming through now that Kenny you really really big now there is quite a bit of poke over on EG but it's right I mean sometimes that sleep can just mean to kill and so when you have these p style compositions that want to try to poke you down and use the general for the engage are there is some pressure put over onto the engage tools that Immortal does having to take the primary engage there is going to be revenged we know how good gragas could be engaged or coming out of the Jungle same thing could be here for the Top Lane you can get even a lot more thank you we have been seeing just to relieve a full tank builds for the gragas top and I will see if that's going to be what he goes for the flash traffic now this is the cleanse out for the count for the Italian Stallion you happen to have on the roster again beautiful planet Zoe disaster for immortals though just gay punishing those mistakes Insanity flashing for was just barely out of Auto attack range you have to double-tap up so it would have been that first Blood over on his fence scary but he misjudged the rage and zouke make some pee and he is going to be so far ahead off of that going for the early Secrets here to just have that mitigation for the Laney face and he is going to be really really dangerous if he gets ahead we saw him and spring in particular really take over some games including some on the Zoe now where he was just Landing sleep after sleep poke after Pope and making it an absolute nightmare. Ford opponents in Taken 3 or damage to self with the Trap already down there and I sprayed all things that I've been having our houses are in region and he is basically out of potion so that's going to be tough and is down three Summoners there in a whole Summers off of eggnog and we can see this performance play hear back towards the midline insanity spotting since Karen on that Ward going over the wall and looking for the hill here just barely out of range not able to connect him then he's just a bit too far for the zoo KC the angle to make him pay picking up those Summers the first flash a line to get the kill and they pick up a second flash to get that second kill Joey looking for the engage here as potluck knows that we have no flash there's no getting out of it looks like they do down there he's got no mana and Keith is going to be attack is going to go down and show is going to follow for Kilz 2 nothing a flash Force the way to run away from the counter cake Evil Geniuses do wrong this nicely done answering that impact was so effective prevent also teepee tent but he didn't really have any man that he wasn't able to get his ultimate out or anything like that so easy end up coming out on top big-time in that bot Lane play definitely picking up a kill impact grabbing a kill for himself and the rich get richer yeah this is a pretty substantial to get write out 1500 already it's going to feel a bit dude every single Lane is winning the good cop it's not enough had to go in for the heck Splash and look towards a folino and he has no flash available but they're just now the lantern to come back up ignored able to get him out of there and then spent during his arrived impact has arrived impact getting back into that back line to standing up enough with that Q on three members of a mortal so then be able to flash out and survived and revenge just not as effective in that sell for play I didn't get to see exactly how the way was shaking out up on the top side but when you both, that TP your opponent gets the kill it's not going to be feeling too good
