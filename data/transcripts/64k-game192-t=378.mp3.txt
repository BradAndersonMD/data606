which is a hair Griffon just hasn't been able to find a true answer for so I love what's pancit on the desk there about trying to get Jovi in a place where he can actually just go One V one against rookie I knew wonder how far back they have to roll to find the show to come for that talk about what about on full Sora Tavares. As it's on the right side when did series open would I pay envelope to the force that game played this one probably wear with the Care on you be coming through and everything else that follows 2 so I see what is most important it is still Keanu the question is are Griffin doing on here theokay if we would have seen another poppy scaring you me then it would have been going next year in the past back in your septic on is dropped but this time I'm lahens the rainokay you know that Nautilus and Leona are the likely picks in her, you know we're talking supporting a flexible champion in that regard those days are long past but are they more worried about getting a jungler or something else is like a jungle mid top and it said Morgana come through instead no longer playing the hard engage support but some in a little bit safer pretty conventional need the Kate Mogan a long time ago against Iraq on Farrakhan will be locked in here with have to imagine the north I mean yasso Upon a Time did earlier than we wrote back and there's a lot they can do flexibility wise of these bands I would actually hope to see a kale van since Griffin doesn't want to get out late game again in my opinionmaybe it's the big lake game Powerhouse band you could see it I guess yeah Fiora instead that makes me think that he's going to read something that can you call a guy on I-70 in summer that is a possibility that you don't sort your on a heartache we're going to go straight if you fight and get a Beat the only time that is a threat. Left open to be selected I guess by the side of Griffin comfort and yet don't know if it was actually a contestant understand it because Invictus gaming has gone what with what looks like fairly comfortable pics dust far and Griffin doesn't want to give him something to potentially run through the Olaf if we see the Scion on the Scion I could I could be well goes to rookie in Medford left what was the top Lane Champion be in this crap ton of Midland paint one more time is the final but you have to feel like that's based on reputation right now I agree I want to be Tobe be someone who gets to be to carry get to be a big deal but not forever and you know maybe that works out okay go trick-or-treating Zion want to play a squishy Champion into Keanu show me saying okay I'm not going to let you kill me it's working late and failed in the game well we'll see what they look like he or 312 Guildford about somebody pee but sort this is the most pressure on him it's been it's been steadily ramping up in increasing it was Bernard the chaos now he is in game number to those temporary do you want to bring up I think he engaged schools are much easier on the grip inside a Scion as well as work on making art deco heartaches on the side of victims gaming leads that might be a bit more difficult here this week is certainly a differently shaped game Embassy here in game 3 up against it all over sweet must happen for Griffin if they want to stay alive or icy sweet their way into the semis Luger second world on this one out and even though Griffin made that week of throwing kale in the Top Lane this composition looks very similar to the style they have played in their first to defeat they need to play heavily around and through Viper and lands Jovi is going to try and neutralize rookie in the mid lane and they're going to have to play maybe even perfectly because I'm looking at IG scaling and how well they can find flanks and how experienced they are and how good they been playing this series it feels to me like the odds are stacked against Griffin in this being really strong with the theory here is a Scion can initiate from the midline easier than the galio hill Russian if I pass the same start theoretically it's easier for him to knock down the dominoes but not as reliable I feel like sciatica bet someone who can out raynes a cop off the backup the Scion die choices of the two top layers this shy about team Fight the Power Over All Phase Rush good at chasing things down for the klepto board sort when I get items in inventory as soon as possible that is wanting to track if they build scale up over time I think between the naderi and the shy debate about Vladimir the shy almost always goes with the phase Rush since he's looking to get his gold basically by Smashing the opponent and then actually tries to teamfight much earlier and that's Wednesday is Russia's going to be much more valuable than kleptomancy so not too surprised to see those stones even though it is good to point out the back of the get rid of all the feathers going to stay alive here this morning waiting for them to come out and give you the one being in there it is and it's going to be simply balanced walking over to Ward and make sure they can try to track Tarzan over there but leave door at bottom side jungles in this world will see yes indeed blue is gone if Trump is gone okay we know the big passing she's probably topside now unless you can bear to the right by Miley favorite words and no that's not happening that has to push up what's down the ward probably expected to be a broadside game from The Jungle Book is gagging for k036 not very valuable and even then not all combinations will work combination of Sion Annalise will be a very powerful level six hits per control for CVS on the map me is going to be a very small fee of sleep tight black shield getting away from that one no problem. I can feel safe yep that's how you want to play the match up with lions actually unable to even get an Aftershock on this Aftershock we're gone it's something he definitely favors were most of them end up going Guardian so for blackshields happen like that I Do's going to be all the windows traits would have assumed Guardian because if you get hit by the top binding you're not profiting off to shop and you are very very squishy as lands and it doesn't need to be a flash primary engaged or with a Scion on the seems to me a little bit surprised for muscle memory that will bring that and make that the choice you need to get a guardian Shield YouTube and gets Bound for useful there as well but again that's not the flight here so we move on we haven't really cool game of the super early we can see ACS lead in top and mid year for Griffin but the bottom is looking good. His gaming side that is ever going to counter pick doing some work for you of course it makes it very hard to do anything as the rakan you can so just ignore in a lot of cases now it's supposed to be coming out as well not going to end up wasting a little bit of time with that teleport in not as bad as you would think though since he had I believe channel that teleport from base was on a reset already sidestep was very impressive from Jovi on Coon most likely would have gone down there of it's not that tankey in the early game free items to PSI on the other good black shield another jump back for the hens in the Tracy going back and forth is just going to besides active not read it out by this still pushing away is in 1 c f goes with a W landing and now no cooldowns available but no man available not going to find me a gauge either a spot of the Saiyans doing the flanks and either but how can I buy Tarzan says I want the 400 gold yeah that was just an excuse to die by Griffin but now short has to survive rookie has the flash they played it just right trailer for the ocean drink but I got to say all that all present favorite Griffin favorite if they cannot you turn this into control wars in the river you can Unstoppable on start your way to repay games if ever bilena Jackie love walked past the middle point of the lane IG do capitalize on the best and they can get which the counter pill top hits. Even so much over there for Savoy you look at the fact that if he was already down that's two waves night of the current what's the plate taken it said actually huge lead in the topside fisheye over sort of killing does a decent job of not making it super easy for Viper to be able to get that killed Bin Ends up going over Tarzan you look pretty this is actually fascinating the rookie has swapped out of that lane y'all can go on top against kit kale potentially having a little bit more kill pressure cuz I was expecting Griffin to just repeat that I've done bottling over and over again and they won't be able to do that if show me matches Top Lane I don't think Griffin should be matching this I mean this is what they want nachos for this is why they want to play armor back Scion rookies Kiana they don't want to give Elena get someone's know it's not the sun go could not find the DACA means no kokuin land rookie playset really well from the other line so I still get something from this even though it is almost acting against black pens. I do have to question Griffin's choices there though because getting a kill on chovi will not win them this game getting kills for Viper breaking that bottom turret advancing the game in that way we'll make it possible so what I do is done here by pulling Toby talk in Tarzan with him is it completely relieve the pressure on the bottom side where there's a flashes won't Morgana like he'll is Kaiser and unless Griffin finds a way to get back to that by side pressure feel like I do to me very comfortable rookie will find out and from that chovy will only be a Scion rather than someone who can act as an early game like his very deep Behind Enemy Lines dive crew for situation here for a rookie the state's leading in the blue team blank Topsham you still get to get that one handed over no problem that could have been different in an alternate universe but works out positively for him to 300 Old Lee what is Invictus gaming stake in this game Griffin with the ocean that we should have some small bits going back to hurt them arguably a slightly better state for them overall and we wait to see what comes through with
