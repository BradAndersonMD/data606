can golden Guardian yes it is I believe had mentioned during a countdown open they can indeed play around Hawks the top side and we'll see what happens if the dress push forward and out here today optic no interest in playing against the bat and who he will have the novel's denied from him one of the stronger engage option available for support these days and play Bruno in competitive but certainly feeling that he has shown in solo queue and we can assume scrimI want to see what else is going to come through here of course these themes are you done fighting so close blinker playoff position very tight race you're mostly Squad the mystery games left to play in till playoffs the two teams who must make there was a flash of a chance at the postseason of a chance that you can play me something like World SO waiting to see what can come through here is that wrist band away from hauntzer just feels like they do you know do you know and if they're not metal bands whatsoever but these are two things that work pretty important golden guard and win yesterday that they both the Solunar that were played yesterday from Golden Guardian taken off the table but that does leave some of the more metal stuff up there certainly Corky is beer if I can be available aatrox now Up and Away there's a lot of options here for Golden Guardians optic as well I am always a fan of Target fans against teams that have fog effect I think it is the right way to runVoice contestant you meet or contest the irelia or whatever it is yourself as the anivia however does it get to get Wukong time he doesn't asriel if we walk did most prized bought leaner worldwide in the patch and locked in here dropped and it's not even close that mean even the top five reasons as last week 32 Ezreal text next highest 14 for Lucian so certainly has been Far and Away the most popular pick down there in the bottom Lane but a frost and other really popular take here is available can be grabbed up and we do know the contract and play aatrox as well so you always have to keep in the back of your mind that it's a possibility of a fight definitely has got ramen here as well finish line bottom later and we'll play a support Adesa Golden Gardens of pretty solid front line now in these Deep by tonsils not one shots going to drain tank for a while and obviously drum very very befitting their front line so poised to play forrent a picture in the back at cost price looking like it will be the graph again yeah by far the most prevalent mid laner Dozier up there as well but almost able to pick 30 as opposed to the 16 of his ear off Rocksino doesn't necessarily have to go in that direction he certainly does have a lot of flexibility in and actually hasn't brought out to use your yet this split so I wouldn't be surprised to see him go another route from the song Vineland vel'koz that is being tied for most pick for him alongside and Nivea so strongly has the options there TF has been fairly popular as well if you want to try to play more through those thighs lanes and then it's also another pic that Robin has shown on the right now though optic him he's talked about what their bands were the results are get fans are getting cream of the crop and be sleeping over your role of the most common Champions down that line really is the most popular picks in in all three roles that they've actually drafted for thus far you heard from talking on the desk about how he wanted to be video cat when does jungle power pics of get a powerful pick for Crown as well I think certainly has Delta do that. As far as going to be a little bit of a split as far as the draft priorities in this first phase as they will grab High stuff or who he's do the bottom line drafted here by Golden Guardians no jungler yet taken for contracts so we could expect them jungle bands on the way of contracts at try to give me. Even more of an advantage in that jungle matchup Top laners beer and there's the first one and Camilla is off the table is I'm very excited to see how this is real + x plays out against price of round they really want us Campion them made up of dhokla what does atrox what the hell I find a little bit surprising simply because I think that Poppy is also a good matchup into aatrox and is you know stove powerful for optic fiber do some particular they've had a lot of success with that pic so I would have liked to see that taken away and Trish Lee optic doesn't really play through their top laner fourth one thing to point out is what is a combo with the feds wanted that you can play poppy play strange but it is the afro top laners that's into the most once. I do want to plant with dhokla is it does have I believe the lowest difference in his gang for than he gets gang in the LCS and received from media me Focus as you stay on those errands Westside wanting irelia another one very strong alongside that evil stack up so you want to pass it incredibly quickly but gragas do you know going to be taken away to Kiev as well for a little bit of focus on frogging as well as contract yes certainly feeling I could have seen going their way but it doesn't mean that you know Jarvis is still available and they are actually just going to decide to take of late but is thought of as a very strong cancer to Stage 1-e how people talk a lot about the 20 passive what's Aftershock interacting with internal off but a lot of people these days for 6:20 or actually just for going there after shock and taking things long lines of hail of blades to try to dissuade Advantage going over to his frontal and I'll pay the support is going to be here for Big Bertha got to the Martian back line with the Ezreal for Arrow Decor key for Crown now dhokla have to pick into what can be a flexible aatrox we are expect that to be a top laner but very like they taken make sure they know what's going on in 4th Golden Gardens waiting on the Run bed and look at another SIMS On Golden Pond movie fighter options enforcement of a tank so very very big problem for optic and because the Corky and there is the vel'koz you brought up earlier probably pick the one up after all this killing his ear would do no vocals does have very powerful wave clear and it is going to be a great fighter makes a lot of sense of the dash very easily deny their from Hunter you can also interrupt this is something that not everyone knows that the class of ultimate actually count as a dash you can actually prevent that from happening with the W from Papeete abraam jump as well so those are all pretty powerful options and it's hard to bully out this Papi what contracts and as a result do not only Kenny actually steal those stats from meteos it don't those getting really take your to good ultimate targets I which is it helped him out a lot in the team fights and I do think that know if you get into those those front or back style the fight having trundle as well as the brawn for the front light these really powerful scaling back liners of Kaiser and Bell cause you to allow Golden Gardens to shred through the front line that has been built up here from optic a game right there a lie what happens as you got hide am the one stop a topic I feel like they have such a dream composition as far as Champion rehab to fix ya solutely one thing for big over there on Optik side but hopefully we'll still do a very good job there I've heard very good things by arrow and big playing together in scrims did them pretty well on maybe not quite few good reputation for getting them all ready to go into this game very very shortly office Mega win here golden god it's also funny flat top stick spot hoping to do it here in their game that's good to be a good one here cleanse you can see taken 5 fragen that is kind of paying respect over mostly to the sedge wanting you really do have to be very careful about that you know we talked about kind of some of the strengths of damage output on the golden Guardian side and using lighting trundled help burn through those frontliners on Optik but also has really powerful and Gage and strong back line here to sew for them it's going to be more about how good of games can you get with this or come with us Edge wanting in we're going to have to track that emidio's as you can see it back to Lane Crown will not go in a queue on a him but that is certainly a lot of punishment and they much longer cooldown burned away yeah FBI getting punished pretty heavily and I did not use the potion at the very least get a Sonos players will actually Panic use that potion to which then just heard that lady pays that much more but he will survive and not mentioned the hail of blades that when he does his ex going to be sleep but works at Sewanee so this is going Alpena cast a little bit more healthy on that clear up or meteos but again it is you know avoiding the Aftershock because you don't want to give all of his additional extra stats over the contracts you can actually go into negative resistance is well and you're passive Falls Dr. In North plus Aftershock tremble all to you and you get punished very heavily so I'm just waiting that pic just with the snapshot to resist and then just trains from there so you can one temporary about to fall off use fall farther further intervention in the negatives was actually a safety took the smaller camps next up early. Lindstrom is not doing too much just yet is FBI and get back to Lane without having to burn teleporter to the house so it take for 5 minutes will get that flashing all will be well and you commit a bush leaves are going to garnish will have temporary Lane Advantage even with the flash down to be a pretty good spot for them as far as the toppling match does going to do cuz we are expecting play fairly defensively it is mostly about going to win standing to push your from the atrox in the early level you can start a fight back later on as you get some more levels answer to pick up some items specials are going to go for a powerful fuel in tank items long lines of sun Fire and Ice born that can be pretty strong but he always has a really good time doing some of these melee matchup just buy actually staying, but with the minions and every time you're passive blockers of throwing that out for at each breast for I am really nice of course grass cause more on my computer's account as melee Gods Dragon Lands End the first thing I'm going to go down did not have a weight house and look at that first one comes through for Golden Guardian back to the last time they play but instead it is actually contracts getting the advantage this time around I seen was decided so heavily around bot Lane where it was actually optic that was snowballing arrow on his grave in medias was pulling up so many great thanks and this time contracts is here and they do get the edge going in for the engage was big butt contract those up there already low on health and he just get to Absolute lockdown losing the Flash and the kill he took the rest was the Cuban from Indian runs away and that was a level 2 recondo didn't have the escape tools and it had to walk slowly back out and it wasn't enough so that's great stuff in the golden Guardian Side Up in gold now fighting for more map control the top schedule dares to give me feeling so good about the fact that reflect on the FBI that is exactly where you want that to go on your thaisa going to be scaling up and that cure in the mid lane McKenzie Crown going to have this is actually a nice place you can have someone come of him who he was looking to threaten that room and try to help fragen in this Lane a little bit and I'll just try to remove some of the events that you get from the teleport because once you teleport back on the Courtney your volume locked under his try and make him take a recall that will cost him see us for sure but as long as off preschool dance available he's pretty immune to Bronx to be honest Safari told me to stay healthy here in this matchup who makes way back down has those boots of speed that is used to get to the middle in a little while ago and I'd love a trade but they're also course holding back on the puppy W course duration is lower as in the past has more impactful thing that happens if you can make it happen but that I was I was like those kind of changes you know it's more about the skilled person can you time it right you know right and you actually really get it just right instead of kind of just mindlessly pressing it cuz they're going to last long time so I will see how effective he's going to be with those but has been a strong coffee player and and also I think to his credit has been no good at playing in 2 weeks out of the map when when he is getting focus good friend of surviving and cut a minimize losses because his name often does like a flame War especially with this new bot Lane around boss-eyed and around their mid laner project for sure we can see what happens if it's just safely funny but of course it took lays down and farm 13 PS out better than you can see about a nearly 200 gold lead in that matchup is medial takes away the Wolves than contractors slightly jungle camp list but who he's on the way over there a spot out where this is going to get his sit around makes the q40 slow immune so right back out there no problems if they weren't spectacles 50 gold across the squad and then go back down to the links to punish a puppy Yoshi is going to be able to invade and now it is contract turn try to get over here so you will not be able to do anything about this and we'll just be able to figure out a little more Visions Amigos is actually a where know that there is a pink worth over in this rush but just didn't actually have time to clear it out so we'll see you win optic does get lien priority if they're going to try to go up and get that done but for now it's golden Guardian taking advantage of the fact that he had bid and bought Busch and now they're starting up in early infernal and with that record over the wall because you know someone is over their foot zoning board down as I don't know if I can guess this really does have its own flag but doesn't have is to know when to come into looks like gold the guardian able to place has one for themselves and a very early in front of right goes over the Red Sea how did Lane so he misses us PS4 too but very little cost there and go to the Guardians going to get a great skill in Dragon really early on run back out and going to try those blows without too much issue and once again that's just pretty soft for this
