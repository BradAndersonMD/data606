rise for them about 9 though like you're saying Top Dog in the LCS for of spring as well as summer the art of the way with five bands done already more Twisted fake and get dropped off the table at the lab are going to start riding the bench a whole a lot more here in the LCS ship a really do not think is that Bible in the morning there's a big enough to not make her that because of thirst I would say let your bonus play if you want to or if they want to and just going to take for the late but not that right now I want to Respec skills leave Eros and Calista he will of marching band. As well see if they continue on with them early tick along that line Israel and Astros available pill and I getting a lot of people have started to walk away from the champion Riley's put a little bit of distance so I like 590 going to be as usual route here specially for it's been has been yeah I do want to support was nerfed in 10.13 looking at all these Global including Regional League like EU Masters I feel it still the second or third most picks in Van Geffen improv play still above 80% residents will follow me over time it seems to like yeah there are better but even in the early days the past people still d r e ginna play with one at least it again here by Olaf is most games played the split that's not always a hard, but it is very rapid we got very very standard 80 carries and jugglers Wildenstein honestly for the lane the extra range obviously with asriel and that's one of the victims to use against the fellas but I just like I know there's a lot of people pretty king of the jungle scale as well but least in especially for cloud nine to action for them and we've seen blabber in the last game in a row because diving tours super early on Friday to force the lot of plays for the team and if they lochinver caught on top of it that's okay play making once again at 49 Gaston 10.13 it does not always fixing to Kill Order sometimes act wburg sometimes a Max of laughs goes until like you and broke like it's kind of stimuli based on players 31st is going to require more damage of macbreak and if both wants to go super hard and do in Akron people have been more damage on the gauges not working so far but the more likely set up here the back line actually, walk in deities cuz the oldie can always reach to self feel when your left alone so I think it would be well and if I even though Ezreal is not usually considered such an aggressive is Bill benefits off of us pretty well yeah I definitely agree the ability to look up very long way especially because call Cloud Nine cops are some form of God, that's the way of being a roofer good delivery for that and getting off the layer that's cute. I like that dance from gotv gotv blinding I'd love to take a 6 down to build you been in the bed liner away from this key here to house been to Cali out there since Jason gone there as well to the most pick champions for both of us have been banned out there with their gone this time and now C9 blind pick one of their pillows they could go for a top laner realistic lien in cash by 9 This Way with lyrics before that with Twisted Vape Plus a lot of jungle attention all Stampy for licorice and Blasting the top size it looks like it's going to get locked in again here so let's see there's no specific date this time around maybe still blabber jugs can throw some attention up there but blinding Liu Kang is is definitely punishable you can you have some strong melee matchups into its I know a lot of people that like Jacob that's as far as melee want you can also do the AP route if you want them. This stuff is active but I like a lot of the Bruiser options yeah I might be there for us we have physical damage to the Jungle physical damage in the bottling there as well as if there is a splinter come through and malphite is Magic damage light armor types pretty well the problem is there aren't a lot of V park that's real on land or they've been very very low ping which is the case here since the LPS is online after off the service in LA and so you got like six Bing on the servers and Sven should have no problem in a way but has good for the pirate solution in your eye can withstand a lot of the pressure as well then the flying the Phoenix 1 flags are throwing up that emote over and over every chance he gets in the game so it makes sense that he's going to use one of doing be the best Champions that he has been using very frequently in the LCL in the rumble and he plays that style as well we talked about so much with the Romans support than a few lines to both of the sidelines for me with bladder trying to feel all those pills and really push the lead in aggression up to another level biggest thing about Rumble is it of course on your level at 6 you had so much more team fighting power but also be able to chase people down with those Lowe's and the long range cast of equalizer you can you can join from the much further distance than most of the other mid laners even if he's not the fate and you can get away with a gold card it's still a lot of damage yeah I'm actually glad you mentioned early-game pressure here as well and mentioned the gun was because 10.30 North Sandra is well the first eight levels of the gamer Q cost more Mana so her waveclear Hurley Layman's but is not quite as good either so in the first unit 9 Minutes the game we may see this key get the jump a little bit more often and I put out there can get let me know the first blue hen it off at 7:30 or so and then kind of weather that storm it is still will mean less pressure in the early game at 7 to watch out for you know how much can the latest move around because you have to miss key is all about going to the sideline about selling his teammates up I'm not sure how much are we talking mouth like I'm not sure about you can dive for a nose real but we still expect there to be pressure on those sites I definitely expected to be pressure in a cloud 9 game let's see if the LG have what it takes to be the first to take them down in summer everybody's trying to be the first see if they can get that one game off of Cloud 9 but Cloud Nine look like they've got that 18 do in their sights and have been sticking to it already Super Galaxy come back breaker disc he's going to hope that he can make sure seal G don't get to come back into this game I want to hang out that's kind of interesting because cloud nine people say they have a very good early game overall but it really depends on what you measure the stat if you're measured it 15 yeah they are clapping everyone there up two-and-a-half Drake's every single time they're they're up a bunch of gold if you measure it at 10 only two of their players have a gold lead at 10 minutes jungle admit everyone else tends to be a little bit behind the other teams are good at leaning against them it's when you get into any mid-game Skirmish at all that's when Cloud 9 turns it on and sew the first 10 I think I'll wear CLG can strike their early game not pictures too good either none of their players have gold leave the 10 minutes to spite their foreign to record they win the games there's not a header Leon. I'm like a little bit earlier and are no Frost Marty and I'm just kind of curious what kind of looking like as a result here for you as well but really defined the new 590d kissing their butt Dial soap opera has the most kills in the jungler in the top twelve of children the LCS is this platter at the top Now 50 is number 4 in assist for all LCS players and it's not another mid laner in the top 12 for assist put that on hold as we have bladder going for a Redbox level Tuesday night with him just blast behind but look at that Summer is gone off the very first bank of the game right from Red Bluff all the way down to the bottom side combining it with walk-in with the ignite to get double Summoners off at 6 a force the bad back for him as well as quick as much there as Larry goes right back into blue side clear sentence waste any time at it he's going to go to ruin do evil and quite a few smells down there is going for the standards of Mana sustained right he's got scorched she's got the look Apollo has accused soon he might know he walked in the Clippers playing basketball right they're ruined bottom with the minions and the Clone right next to him as well both of them with channeling their potions and then she's going to be able to be here exactly how many minions are helping out with the fight has welcomed into the trouble range plus the Canon A-1 Auto off and then with the extra out of there yet do I head on this trade and I think I think you know that you're busy her so she can take you out of the brush she's going to land by the steam at the time but that is Flash down on for members within four minutes on the sealed Eastside very fun to watch you work here top laner the zip lash was licorice there but whatever make you some quick work of both of the other lanes in that scenario when they're all down like this all of the lane for CO2 now have to be second-guessing themselves you can see they're all at their turrets every member of Zod very Weary at the moment and that's when whoever can return to farm the camps after me ozee aggressive work has been shot in the line the length that is just a shock to me that somehow he's farmed despite the fact that he had to run by the bank and now you get away from the counter take belt and a level lead for ruin this fight could go very very well he's going to get hit there and Labyrinth killer was sick by Wiggly Safeguard about how to lame was that mid-length play that they tried to pull off so get the really well time you from Wrigley Field to push them off and create some pressure there too because of it Liquors is not backing them and they don't have to pressure to deny the minion wave but ends up turning into still to be able to get the menu for baby shower but you're not going to be a pretty well. Expertly done here on Wukong knows the damage output knows he could it would want her to go out of the devil long so it obviously really helpful in that once he's knocked out the way it's going to be the capital D m at Dunn that's a lot of wave control that's going to feel really comfortable as venti he's down to the bottom line here is stacking up now get the colon that one as well as there wasn't much help to buy accept a longsword if he was going for 34 so yeah I don't like that fire Crystal was with the 80 instead of his hours so you want to deny as many of these means that you can there's no fella 4468 thinking when she gets plastic surgeon so you deny that you can a mouse of that way and increase the sleep or I would have woken spent plus allow in both rooms to go roam around with Viber free big Power opening airport by 9 that is under 6 minutes during the game and Drake I seen this before and it's called every cloud 9 give me the entire split-toe turn down the tops for Big Timber II comes in and that is our difference. Of time to of the toppling double ultimate activation there for electrician stacked up their conquerors so he's really he's got his early TM at 2 so it's 9 Elites the wave licorice with the Wukong once again showing the rest of the North American Top laners what they are missing out on yeah this is this is what top it looks like when you go for the solo kill and it backfires on you back at level 3 this one looks different without that gold injection but obviously now is going to be a real tough one for ruin and the rest of seals you to navigate this really game is going to look great visually which is vast majority in this game all right foot to head off to post office you can get back out on any of the minions we haven't even really seen a big influence of the oven did Lane I don't know where can I hike it up for misky there's been a lot of jets blabber lease in I am crazy loonies and then liquid V self doing work on the Roof dog experience Advantage with the old killed by the way well yeah and it was to be fair One auto differences far as I know how close that was in the miscalculation but that means a whole lot I thought I can use that goes off
