nothing up justice like what tattoo after the first two game system does not seem to be able to match flyquest as far as a team fighting goes and if they want to commit suicide last night I think they either have to go towards a scaling Jayce build and hard commit to the sled push it with Kira Black Fever of living room king of these types of things into a tank or they have to go towards a top layer of the scales better is one day when they can dominate like the Camille like the Jacks for 10 T even something along the lines of Fiora they've got to really commit to that place Dallas or not to be able to win in the Bible 500 flyquest back on right side only twice all series have there been there to the most choosing blue in the TSM piece of writing was working there and it means the Caitlin band comes the run right side Lucian is the band that is left up as a result and TSN says ok google take your son away push you down to a shin said that it has been the highest win rate 80 karrie for both of these players in the postseason they take that tray back and forthwill take the set that you've been playing for speaking so often solo play Sadie set wealth than foreign Place take set exceptionally also 50s them on the graves and the tfv8 lock back in for Bjergsen so I really do like a crazed pair long side this Anne of the Senate is relatively low DPS if he's going to go for multiple tank Bryant Myers said it needs some help killing Frontline in CFA help to fill in with some of those responsibilities but I do think with the TF getting locked back up again TSM to go towards at Heart by slippers to play two words with silent I don't think we're going to get in or anything like that from DSM I think they want to play this before so I wouldn't be surprised to see some Dan from that way if they are worried about something like Two Jacks potentially plaque with could also lines ups that is left up I'll see if that's going to be the case in the panwhat are the bad here ignore I think was really good on it last game and I did doubt I think both of Lane as well as how easy it would be for mosquito bites but I've got to credit his time and he was able to draw so much pressure in those who dwell time Shield steam rooms or damage being able to create pressure in a lot of those fights and did play it exceptionally well yes indeed look really good for pancakes I was curious and it was actually work on which is bile Frost most played to the end of the series and it makes me wonder if he is Sam just didn't like what the match it look like if the game played out for didn't like the champion in the team compositions overall but regardless or support fans come through you got time.Orofino High HP Bruiser if they wanted to go towards the jacks or whatever they wouldn't vandemore to Kaiser if you're already kind of thinking that if they wanted to go to the GPU probably wouldn't be in the morgue and it is going to be hard case here a lot of it gave a lot of guys I've already for the flag beside you haven't Leona follow that up with the Oriana fall set comes flying and you have the Ashera was well I do feel like we're gone is kind of the one that screaming out to me in a being able to Lane very well against of Leona be able to block a Cheryl's be able to stop a lot of Assisi that could it come out from there and they do have it be available this time it will be a last pic though for solo and we know it could be said top it could be that jungle they have the flexibility there were gone I think it's I think they want something Frontline not near as well cuz they don't have to do can go in first without Duncan zillion to let Camille does yolo in and make it okay that's been banned away ever since game when I think they need somethingdo front lights and play My Life For Hire let's keep butt around me Nautilus stoneplate he's not as Tanki Guardian handle Aftershock to get some more Frontline but this is a very squishy team for TSM there are so many good targets for Leona for Acero 4 orellana Shockwave and now the question is are you okay with a pressure or are we going to put that on and give solo counterfeit Gateway just come at you nonstop that being said from behind against a very different story then it is again that's going in Scales incredibly well can just straight-up get to the point where he is killing you very very easily in that side length is also drafted alongside that require a lot of back line access fee don't think of Mark having that back line access one up and over the top is a grave Dalton it over the top is this an altar for the added damage for the durability that the shield will provide to some of these divers and it's going to be up to fly quest to try to disengage send this to try to lock down to these carries burslem out because as you said they are very squishy and they're susceptible to the CC if you jump in there is a Camille and you get immediately Leona combo Shockwave. By the Oriana you will know live very long you want so game 5 is coming and solo he's probably left on the island of his magic is good it looked up Diamond 2 + 2 with you when getting play Quinn's 1/2 more percent more than would be expected based on Champion win rates so is going to feel pretty good will see the top of magic Ken gowell otherwise we are on board game 5 of the LCS finals I am so happy we were brought all five games here and now it is down to Blind how well can all 10 players play is a trophy number 740 s m or oflike West Point Thayer Banner for the first time in LCS history we will decide here today over the next 30 minutes this is a spicy level one I'm itching to see how hard they commit to this but so far this is so smart from solo so this was a planet date for a top laner he's going to be waiting and try but she doesn't leave it could be what is seen the word go down like two seconds like no one else around or fine but you're right people were coming right that was about to kick you to stop the recall yeah I feel like solo could have stopped it pees on division little babies solo didn't know how close the rest of them were and what was worried about a bait but with all of us may be a possibility to Atlanta by Frost anyway it was Much Ado About Nothing good positioning from solo strong bit of foresight there to be sitting back if you are at the dry brush which is the most common kind of loved one position as a top laner you just died about a date because we're conscious of behind you TF2 walks around the corner and with that gold Garden all of a sudden it's like well that sucks so good preparation of both sides the level ones haven't amounted to anything in this you know we we expect a lot from loved ones from black with especially they look really good with the preparation they're both teams did try some stuff in this one but nothing really came from it about series late or early play comes in nice Tracy's going to take some blows back as well turtle eggs are feeling comfortable enough so he will be the squishy your version if there's a lot to be hot they can burst him if he'll come see about that one regardless the trades go back and it is still fly crust with the landing lead so far but to the point about late playoff series is not only do you have a lot of tape to say hey to have any bad habits level one but also if you have not had a couple 100 surely some team would have already cut with use that end in your bad habits would have already been exposed by 7 to take you down and semis were in court or something else and so yeah okay I'll say Taurus reach out of the bot Lane they are setting up what could be a potential by the murgu of Aftershock Leona and they could look at this is my city is 3 enough to kill the next Viking is here where the thumbs-up Evo black was with the huge start the game 5 for men play doubt it at bottomley level 3 mid later shows up level 3 shows up they have a tank Yuliana a lot of the early shots in he goes straight onto biofrost pop tonight to pull aggro hit the cute and follows with me Flash's out avoiding that last PowerShot N2 you're trying to get that final bit of damage down to it for its surviving with almost no health and that is not a TV bottling you died at your tower that with the wave pushing biofrost and Douglas will be in trouble from this spot you come back and you have a pi of a of a Mana crystal that's it unlocking to look pretty nice girl in Aflac Westside seven to eight hundred gold lead of a longsword comes in feels wonderful in India there's no first I want to know if not more than 800 gold so it's not like I was getting the money what are some good Champions write your texts not a bad early-game chance to get money on get your your item across soon as possible to help sore farmlead help you pay some Drake's and obviously while total getting 300 that's going to feel good as well so fly Quest writing well over in game five let's not forget the Broken Blade he's got a TF Midland and he's on Camille this is a lane that decent can crack open in the mid game it is what the bot lane from SIA Santa's got to be able to withstand the onslaught when you get for me and I have that early it becomes very very difficult Leona is a champion that can be oppressive from ahead you're so much additional armor know with that W active plus the Aftershock and makes you so tanky gives you the ability to pull off. I would like that especially when you are setting up or those guys with the set solo a little bit of this striking back on the top side so now the trade come to the bottom yet again but an easy Escape biofrost jumps around the shield and yet and that was a little bit agreed there from solo stay around with no Mana low Health above and beyond the kills himself himself also had to pick up sapphire crystal has his recall probably couldn't afford the Ruby and it means he's going to try to use fan but he is down 16 CF and it's not going to get better got the door and play for a little power here but this is dangerous he's sick that he had she'd there is still potential is Camille at this point is gold a Michelle going to feel good Center on the force is playing right bottom side they are going to stack that Drake in the early oceans right that's going to feel pretty nice bit of missing health regen can help to keep some of the bad matchups afloat but it's still a long road ahead look at how aggressive Broken Blade is in empowered to get this weed gets done until off off two of those, or may yet have exactly an Audi RS6 so if you're thinking get The Pusher or go missing from that lane to get the very dangerous you can see santorin knows this witness wave crashing solo has got to be calling hey they could be here to dive me they could be looking you can see Oriana moving up you can see set moving up there were expecting the potential other than I but in this case get them is not actually looking to play for that you're so I believe was grabbing blue it looks like you went over to the side or perhaps just faking or move toward stop laying down to spot the Red Bluff when it comes up when Center and try speaking to come to the vision that they have in this could easily be 3 man talk it again open Torch Light for this one we know the middle and I can show up first as well read. Can be attack Tia sent with just all the top pressure in the world I got to go for a bus to you I think this is really smart, Tower texture resources elsewhere so they take away the crugs they're going for this red and they're both of those camps easy peasy couldn't even look to try to go over towards others Raptors and take away some more as long as Dirksen can maintain this push you're not going to lose that what they want is a red bump with Graves upper level on Pandora and the blood came through and Central got insist on the other but it is still like 3 Camp lead for speak a hundred gold for rent. Fields pretty nice have roughly make up for the money earned any way to not an easy target and weathering the storm to a late is right now is equal see at the cross before despite the fact too long swords and boots and now it's your two boots and you're even on Farm after getting form and over at level two I think I'm just a very impressive Landing a front of the CSM Duo to be able to play This Plane to a stalemate from that spot if not an easy task DSM have been as you're not bleeding more killed out in all this is our backup doublelift biofrost they've got their flashes I got the heal backup only cleanse wasn't used still waiting for that one the first time that he needs to so far so good 300 gold diapers and some of that is out the back of Gangplank printing free money on the side of course the F does the same we will wait to see you in the first result comes to review switch over to ignite from the Spellbook I might find him in one of the side lengths soon so is honor awardees ETrade comes in there's a thunder of the first you is the lot of damage, so he's got a hard time he could come in and it does so indeed how to fill a lady's got the work he's got no way out he drives a slow but the flash while I was there and broken play Top Lane Ward's potting soil the walking up the face check that brush she knew it was coming to point-blank hook shot come through he chases them down gets the kill solo an outdoor ultimate do teleport do Flash and you have a Sheen to be up there who's going to be able to fully reset this way of habit pushing toward them and this is going to be danger for that Gangplank because for the next minute or two here is his way of sorts of push away here to be so susceptible to a potential TF tank and it might just be a battle of top different sources bottom difference yet whoever the 10 it was 98 coming out of the series on 22in to of this one and now.
