and Silas take out the table a big butt Big Bear Jason taken away deer abandon us again AJ's monster did play yesterday had some strong moments in the game but I think the problem with Jason an A in general has never really been that they don't have any good moments as they can't Lane if that have struggled to close out games and struggle to use two days to do that to really explode their leaves that Jason and take over the game of the big game and then just close it out before the extent of sorts of fall off but that being said another flight to pick be been a lot of girls always CJ spot yasso can certainly be flexed into multiple roles with our last year as well so Flex picked the name of the game in the band so far and then LeBlanc also gone as far as I know I tried playing it not my style who you're not going to put yourself first I look like 10 speed force plate good into most control Mages you jump in there you you get passing the ranges in and do a bunch of birth so also going to piss up the beatGarden swing South be his own you need to Camp right I feel like he has had the most success on the car that doesn't Victor and even his anivia detour to fix that other people are not really playing but he's so damn good at it fits the way that he wants to play the game and I think it makes the most sense for him I know there are kind of detractors of that foul thing that he should be sticking to metal pics but I actually think that if you can play with the level of Mastery also these pics that are outside the bed of it yep your opponents have such a hard time actually preparing for you still cure a Nivea players birthday via no one wants that practice I get the back of Egypt's golden on the flip side but there was not a soul whose getting prepared for that and I think it really can be valuable either way I lose on the tables going up now as well as if I was going to make a pick up here on this one has get from the Champions Boulevardyes certainly is it's much more about you being able to push to block it does actually hold area around until DEC has been fighting pizza dough easy when you're coming towards her and she has been in control Elena got poked can be very very terrifying and exactly who he playing The Victors out of Frog and Toad book you're grabbing much more the control made the frogs have a lot of sex at dawn and parody in the draft so far yeah that's the Cure can still be flexible we know someday played it earlier on in the year but all those things as though he who is ra9 9.9% going to the middle and diabetes body to say yes in tears are more than a band spirit I do things very likely from Disney's Gambino exactly as you say that it is zooming the bills are both the mid laner allusion in The Passage through the bandplay we'll see if old and Guardians can actually go get a leave down for themselves in that to be to where they haven't been as effective this year certainly has as receive these guys been in Nocturne been here for a hundred things that feel like slippers and can often be a very good win condition for them and not for a couple of split pushing well with the 131 you join in some YouTube sideline we Sauced smells like that kind of stuff back in the day was malphite Nocturne to be one that worked okay but they're not going to get that one that's a good thing because what nation is so Paramount intro play Nocturne make it much more difficult situations are in it also is disabling teleport from coming through Kodi source of responses that are text via media in Pro player no longer able to beat though so I think Nocturne really does have a lot of power in that regard. Irene good be sad to see the wrecks band away and we will have to wait another game at least if he's growing up the way it again now what's the jungle picked up yours if you don't grab a stolo even if it's going to be seen by a hundred thieves think we're going to play for teens by Travis it is how they won the previous game they came back with Team part of a team fight I would think we would at least I'm probably coming through for contracted popular pic of all the bear as much of an opera is it is actually does work well into Zach the slingshot with the roar so if you wanted to go for it would be cool but don't think we're going to get it gragas another one that does work here you connect me to the body's lamp to interrupt that slingshot also is going to have some pretty powerful for the game yanking and is it going to be in the Kent going to pull around back in there so Hunter get a blind pick a top laner and Rise seems to be the hover right now will pick up go get a guarantee but that would work or something like it like a budo pick your actually think no weed that we never see it thanks against kamado damn it typed on the top of the map the top laners Midler and the jungle are all going to do magic damage was Joe ridiculously resilient against that sort of style pics like that even now, I readily effective do Malachi's no troubles more it's going to be ribbon so and it certainly you can still go towards things like the extra credit and it building in that way you can get her Liebert read that can be very powerful Sunday running back to pick that certainly did not work in early out his for him at all and honestly General Perris have not been looking very good about playing 400 he's largely in part due to the fact that some are not working well together we saw it was somebody brought up the JC were constantly feeling there's one place yesterday as well we thought the same thing happening when I'll just playing MP4 as he's washing it to engage somebody is backing off that have not been on the same page at all of that is why I generally don't like scary fixed for them because you really do demand jungle present when your bike carrier a match if you get behind you can be worth through the case of contract versus and who's going to be in that lane fast enough as they expect rise for 7 to be pretty volatile here SS come up coaches shake hands probably only one who wanted a handshake is going to be okay here and we'll see how this one goes going to be exciting on here at battle between teams in the exact same spot in the squad there is room to grow you know if I can catch up with the top Echelon of the teams for the Elsia and well they are both tied in the standing of the last couple weeks before the golden Guardians they did have a very rough start for they are now for the three in there and their last seven have lost through some tough opponent so we'll see how they're going to look you're against hundred thieves who really was throwing yesterday against clutch sitting at last place in course we know that clocks are waiting right behind them in the standing of the picking up that winterle Iran and they are in that time for 6 place was one playoff spot up for grabs it and let's start picking up several more ways to catch up with black West and CLG and we are out of the rift now go to Gardens under thieves both these teams because you quite well coming into the year it's been a very slow start on both the sides it was seven games to play they can't spell makeup that and who he what is the first shot Snipes actually is little of his thing as it is to start vacuuming flovent and I miss you we got to be is actually taking that and he is still getting that first hit does always feel really good even though it's not the biggest of deals are the faster you get that medical Advanced active better you're going to feel as you start getting that consists of region very very quickly now watch this aggressive word come down I believe it was specifically spotted although gold is here waiting to see where the jungle actually start working down from contracts and it's easy to see how golden Guardians plays around the top of the map because I do kind of favor than I think in any early to vaduz I certainly rise plus gragas I think should have a pretty good time and it needs to be to get the doc is me fairly weak in the early level but that being said once that starts getting more points in a gelastic slingshot very difficult for women to actually a rather for the rise to push in on the Rhythm that can be attacking you from his angle that you're not necessarily evil toward out or expecting if you get on top of the rise postal 6 with ribbon for that that is going to be very very being stranded infant past this really laying here is the charges are used by Golden Gardens are the ones pushing an early on is and is doing a pretty safe clear so far his own jungle give me 30 Raptors very tender sub talismans it one of those comments. You can do on that go straight to read I will see where he likes to go from there I just need some Zac players just completely skipping going to stop at all and just trying to do a full clear because are they do field at Zacks dueling is still weak and if you get caught out and be very very dangerous but in Pro play you're off and seeing them going to try to avoid the dragons with the vision they have it on the map and probably going to go on doing phase Rush here on the rise and it's very easy to get just ew off on a Target and then tied away so we can do pretty well this one but it will not have liked that Aftershock tankiness food withstand a big chunk of births just a quick look over on that one it's contract is going to be taking a very unproductive fight for this coming Friday so many Pros do really like phase Russian general we're seeing even more of these days on Oriana has come out of because they feel that at this skill level having to move speed is just so valuable because they're so much better than your average player actually got going on still shot them and taking people down and just make more use of that added speed though it's not always as effective for a few players it can be very very good in Pro maybe getting pretty long now already missed of course cleanse here on the Victor but South Carolina and biscuit everything else to get this Zach going to bring the jungle to life and fight them both the same time for 20 may you be on the kit to Kiewit to both well and going to stay safe and not fighting about to go down this way and it didn't actually end up going for either of us cuddle so this is just him doing a full clear of his own side he's going to go down and see that that's goal isn't backed on go back to his wolves and it will be that sick can clear into a recall which I feel pretty good the longer the game goes and the Greeks have nice to be shown hadn't actually got enough any dank Zack just wants levels experience there is so critical for this Champion to increase the range of your elastic slingshot and all to have lower cooldowns on your abilities in general that level 3 gank is is usually pretty hard to pull off a electric ranges is so small Play Welcome to be the first recall there and gets bobby send her out of it I have to knock down the Walls as well so it's pretty easy stuff and we'll see you around to the jungle fairy looks like his contract walked in and I don't think he's ever quite seen Zack's can't know for sure can sit down I can surmise that everything that's got all this he's taking all fix the other one that's actually quite mistake right there and all that time spent means nothing nice for him but contracts bar and meanwhile I don't really have anything to do with till the crugs do come back up so I'm going to move again trying to get up perhaps a little bit of vision and he is actually listen to deal with a whiskey when your bit later is in base you're probably have to win the one we want to get the gragas will seem so he wants, collapsed charges up to eat able to walk right back out as long as you can save that one and he went out the body plan is going to be okay now it's right on the top side good damage out for some day but passed respect the fact that you can trade back in his own supposed to have HPV and Riven does not have a lot of health regen was going to be a long road back up as soon as the shield is down there from that initial trade you see that Hunter is able to get a really big birth back down but now and I just hope you're really to ask for that way then he doesn't want to allow a monster to read that way van it in a bad spot that he's showing up just in case bracket is there because Rufus pretty horrible when you're that far push-up Michael chunk right there has been put some shots for the deathly lot of mine do fairly close to Eeveelution are WhirlyBall in the end of it yet that's the bank already had you to tell Port went back. It's here graphic also looking to play this pretty passionately scale up and has not yet look Too Faced a dental you want to see someone like illusion using it early days trying to get a good item I think and believe this Lane and actually the delay FedEx Rolla bed and he's going to be going back now it's worth noting that is TP Lucien also which I think is fairly a typical we do generally see TV on on the Ezreal sit on things like Denver but I definitely have not been beaten nearly as much emotion and if you're doing it for a bunch of lame priorities but you can never get the back and it suddenly via had on the bush by getting that to your Shame by and then right back in Landen oh we'll see if I got to look at church because of this is certainly worse than the actual team fight is worse than the two tissues if there's an actual brawl this way. They won't lose me fun pretty interesting to know the concert does Alexa go lost chapter before his tear that is very rare to see from the rise player that this is more power immediately right so this is less about the scaling more about him trying to the bully someday and and Max of power of that early Caulfield by which is always going to be so good for Riven with that early CDR chicken pasta Shield runs away and now maybe almost at the trade it someday. Play Smashing it out misses the ultimate also missing the W son in a 21in hanser barely able to get away with his wife like that early Power by of the Lost chapter someday running late so far but both these guys have no TT and no flash so jumbled intervention could mean a lot because I don't tell bar pretty low but you got it in trailer brake coming through to Golden Gardens in that is certainly a payoff for playing or aggressive bottom line Lucian Alistair pushing the Ezreal and Brahman of the turret and they look at these especially when your job is going to be building a p your top laners going to be building a p this is not a couple of Tanks is not a sad one in a Scion F4 Champions all really care about them in front also one of them better, you can have it here milstein Audi Goldie just so slight towards hundred thieves and again sodakite the result when you got a compliment to Champion so I look at a pretty solid
