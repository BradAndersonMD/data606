who all play together before it was something out then for that starts now he won the Academy final Savella toast America competition out like most successful jungler in any way for Smoothie in the bottom land was traded off the team but now I'm number three must-win situation for cloud nine and Jensen's back in billion is back out they go for the switch three straight games he has a performing very well is playing with a doll that got killed on their own in the bottom light in both gave one and gave to what it felt like being started to fall across the map and these will never really haven't drove are losing control jackets are there never really able to get through that late game for the switchif they had been to worry about earlier in this series II out themselves willing to give away the wrong before going into it or are they just daring clouds are credible Frontline around until they had to get a job in ItalyI actually might like to go for Gangplank so ass just not had very good escaped with exactly put together a comp where you can pressure down the bottom line of the Ezra from can do that if you can pay for them yeah I definitely agree and also the opportunity again to bring in something like Lucid much easier to attack an ad as that jumper than it is a chi stuff has the ability to make a lot tougher to get those tickets at for double lift it made sneaky think of something longer early Lane face with the vale go for very strong quick phrase from afar or had the option to jump in with Rob if you call your jugular and you have 4 numbersonly uncomfort yet again here in this one is for Donna for back to his breasts getting banned earlier and wants it at this time around does seem like a crab the sign before the band face they will three straight so I can swear they've all been good so far they have been very very good at pull a in the semi-finals on his breast was really on point with each book after book after book is he now he's going to have to be careful about that I made it till afterwards if you at that is with both the threat of the actor Arrow as well as that of the fresh up a jump of her own safety there the lantern is very big and repositioning for the guys wear liquid mind for peeling the Cloud 9 giving those Scion away looks like mush Morton counter pictus trundle of course incredible against giant Frontline tanks and sticky we've been able to.your time is up time Garner band out here at Cloud 9 1 a whittled down on the office that's if he has to pick their roles in early early very strong open figure from Five Guys Who provide a lot of really pressure still a lot of people talking about how about there being able to neutralize midlane all them out of the car and you the bottom line has wind condition in a row but if they don't want to grab it they may want to take it away and it's not going to be either as a power farming jungler to let it would have been to the way all right what A Team Liquid going to take off the board Here solo laners still left for Cloud 9 and it is pause Lane Focus licorice so many games recently in these playoffs on the Oort Cloud 9 of relied on it for that long range there are other options do end the toppling we have any other region 16 obviously Joe got his very, but things like Greg se10 go as well now that you got taken away this rental and you also have the to Gatsby's that combo against one tank to use I always think is incredibly strong into you fight you would do so and then you can book them down with that Beast might want another think you member to go along with it and pray that play that Frontline because again not a lot of mobility and they really needed set up the battle advantageous situation for SS to be able to have a tough time dealing damn it. Just go back to something like that malzahar and Play 4 for in this game for something like an assassin what are the areas that scene I've had the advantage in that middling I don't know if that's a magic power off in the back straight into rides instead of I do more of a team spider will do what he wants to go for a heater core work pretty well in Princeville whittling down to Frontline as well as plenty of physical 40 play imagine he would have to keep in mind because it's such a crazy combination the room prison the body plan he's going to be surprised even through all the reworks that we've had with both of these is for both of us but again we have talked about the focus on killing Frontline here for the tea Nike composite is a trundle the Cassiopeia what are the best in the game at full thick down goes frontliners this will be a powerful 585 cam position but you also have to remember you put a Verizon the sidelines it could be really avoid that 5:00 e55bt final Champions collect of the NLCS 2018 season and knocking down Cloud 9 lineup d91 lying on Veterans skill and Instinct Spencer is Benson back together here alongside this year's rookies and basil and licorice Nikki hope it is not that we have not in the past Avery about to be starting this trophy on the line a trip to World on the line for cloud nine you know liquids going as number one number two to be decided here Oakland is ready we are players are as well as game 3 have to remember also those World implications hundred. He's going to be watching with bated breath if ye'll Wednesday also Auto qualify in with that second spot for North America alright Cloud died all of their hard work the entire summer with motivation issues changing rosters working together training comes down to this and liquid looking to defend their Championship only have known winning that's forming as a team and they want to keep the streak going dim look at one of the few super team that I've actually born fruit in League of Legends they grab impact on cloud nine going to win a championship with them obviously won worlds what years ago with SKT and is on his way back to World once again now on Team Liquid Xfinity arguably the most successful jugular in North American history with a win here gets for trophies the most of any jungler in North America I would move double its 25 tying him with barracks in for the most all-time in the NLCS SS also grabbing the MVP honors yesterday no checking those boxes to be in that conversation for the best player in North American history the only guy to do it on three different teams he is constantly had to prove himself kicked off of seal G1 with TSM kicked off of TSM one with Team Liquid as well next release for the garage at the ready to be taken scrubs for his first non buff camp how it works in trading here with the Axe by the way you fire off your volume to get your lethal Tempo products going with your very quick trades and burst of power as we all do you keep your distance to Autumn has been so good all the time about doublelift but Olay in the first game there with the Borgata flashing out of the garage getting there till back out with rash horsing Summoners and forcing Health trades with Cloud 9 is out of potions now he remember he is running teleport not the heels if you were to get caught by another flight another book you may see that flash forward and look for that first was that he wants to wait till they get TP Back Forty or he's not going to burn that until he has that 800 is gold Beauty foot up brace but it's going to be awhile effective Lane looking this bad you check in on the top side as well liquor has had a hard time fighting and even with the gang giving him over in game to not be able to be the stronger player so far then that looks with Baymont Smithy. Chase had his own jungle and even though he gets away alive Spence Karen get to claim the reward for me the Grump doing some counter jungling and you have to wonder if that is called flash what I do they look for the first Blood knowing that this is the elimination game and maybe playing a little bit you can't take a nap hospitals his to claim as well but the rest of his jungle for the first time it's 50 is actually behind the jungle matchup sending that TL I've been relying on in this series Best Western finally neutralizer player so far things looking pretty good in that midlane for gentleness Philly a big part of why that's going to be able to have that pressure is the fact of the Casio is pushing pobelter try to answer that but book after book diesel getting pushed out a likely going to see this you will have to go back to base year contract with you will get a nice little something for him take it back to land without too much of an issue here to yell going to match that recall yeah Missy something we bring up a lot with him to get his boys on stage is one of the most unsociable players it packed also Library cool Under Pressure there yet to tell her to get back what's 50 on this date even after going to counter jungle you can move to the opposite side of the map go get the counter grumpy and leave behind again Vision it's all about these Wards so many deep warts from a liquid that have led to the success in this series you started out very early working with both pobelter and Olay for it and now they once again have a big setup that has seen this movie in the works from Cloud 9 the Rubik's Azle up though they may want to look for flaky Rhonda pobelter remember pobelter not running Cleanse This Time Around so if you could get a bronze done onto me cuz he dropped it again he saw them come through their own jungle on the wards so they know that he should be playing defensively and should be playing to the topside away from that we'll see if they can actually make this happen and if I even go back around along with realizing that can't go through the line through the river will not find the game going to walk by of War himself we know spindle spend down here and nose is probably some words on him good. The time here since Karen all the trundle counter jungle to boast of the Raptor camping left the vision around of his own and be able to see Smithy so they can track Smithy they know he's going to the topside now and Cloud 9 can be a little bit safer 3 complete response Karen that is the biggest cloud out of had so far and it might be an early fresh out of the box when do teeth mylibertyconnection use his full teleport channel to get back to Lincoln earlier that was ATT disadvantage entirely but in fact it's nothing out of it to make a big play for the team they are but they have flash also and the numbers were kind of people eyes they're so they call it off Pizza me you'll see us there for the top lamp or liquor if she has a little bit of a lead so far I will be an ultimate ultimate at 6 as only hit 6 midi if they don't play making a with that group of players who try to attack a lot of off
