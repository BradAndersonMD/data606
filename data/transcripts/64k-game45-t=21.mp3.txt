online most team didn't want to avoid plan wanna be getting the better seating for world looking for better groups and chasing that Championship coming in from the other bracket of course if you really really nice for either one of the squad's why Quest got to be kicking themselves for not being able to close out that last game but tactical with a heroic performance and guess what first they get a vehicle is this like my friend off the board right away I'm curious how important in this draft how important Evelyn is in the grass because honestly be start with pretty good Caitlin remains off the table take a note from the other regions of the world in lck in the LPL in the LEC to Kaitlyn fan rate is 90% or higher only 16 by that one as wellat least Graves up as chance of rock so they could have been out the ass if they're concerned about that that would leave the Evelyn up to you know it as you are saying there is a chance okay to it immediately go ask them if your flyquest year was Santa band out that leads me to believe Tim would be looking for a gym after and I think that's fine but I would way rather have factual off of your high DPS Marksman is the ash put them out of the gym it wasn't as effective last time I've honestly pretty surprised if they're going to prioritize the crazed above the act because I do think that will give I think of you dance the bottom line for either team unless you have something really sneaky that you want to try to answer with maybe you want to go towards the other Lucian The Bottom Line we have been seeing it that we are really only been actually in the soul prior to the Buffs for Lucian we did the SS have a winning Lucian game out of the bottom line but no one is going back to it thenyeah and I think it's definitely an underutilized Champion overall but either way we'll see what comes through a first gen is liable a lot of things play Ezreal still though I'm not a really big fan of any more Champions out there that you don't want to go for that one 1/2 games on it was bandaging for an appeal take it away and game fine I will also say that Graves if you're going to if you're going to be like in orrtanna Grace is a good pairing for it because it's the idps jungler that can help them make up for some of the deficiencies in your kit the fact that you are more about the birth and less about the condition damage can be helped out I crave so if there's a parent to do with this doesn't make sense we obviously are going to be expecting something like you Oriana coming through from power of evil I would like to just see him grab it right now he's been so good on these Gilly Champions but they are looking like her prior to its worth with does thequick cook frozen band over towards power of evil try to cut him down a little bit and that mid-length yep I really do think there are a lot of viable Champions that pu we can play he's got stuck by Champion pullover all that I don't get the day was not able to do as much as solo who really took over on that set I would not be surprised if he said pick up again for black so good on it really realize that match it wouldn't be shocked to see a banyan with you to come through about that the kind of lack of attention to Morgana when it's been like a great first round pick before it gets bad but someone's always going to be an outside Crown Oriana could be taken away so that's kind of like it then for Aflac West as you say but I do feel like this game has been so much about liking team fighting and Oriana is one of the very best in that regard Oriana is deer know he can go to word things like Sandra he has more pics like LeBlanc but it's just not this as far as the team fight threat in the consistent DPS not by any means excellent on its overall as the NFL's mentioned we might want to see bar come through at some point but it does leave send her as a viable option that may well be the second band coming through based on the champion. OK AP kog'maw of course also makes sense as it is here, but it does mean that. Bindra is up it means Corky is up there there's a lot of people there are four key hasn't been seeing nearly as much play lately I think a lot of people are going to have a concert at the feels like it in the lady says these games but you know you would be running this kind of trouble by but perhaps it it makes things like tabbies and even though it's warm milk a little bit more effective in that way if you want high damage you can also go to something like a Casio but that does get out range by the azure pretty heavily so it can be difficult to actually close the gap and get the damage out they would like to do I even though Tabby is of course armors not reading at work yet still affects Auto attacks exactly is on so you don't love our Burgatory I wouldn't know we are effective syndrome support really well nickel pic but here here is my issue that my issue is generally that when you have ordered Volver already locked-in you can deal with Sandra is damaged just like getting out right like I actually don't think that's has a lot of fun killing Frontline so generally speaking is this is me playing the order of the volibear I'm just stacking helping armor and I'm just thinking that my health will be enough mordekaiser I do think helps erectile that's why I do like that a bit as a combination you can't really ignore Magicka damage completely when the mordekaiser is also parrot alongside that's Android because it on that now it's a double AP so Lanes as well as a depressant a marksman and the jungle so as a full pairing that makes sense than it does give you some early and make him priority but this isn't the kind of Campion that that really can dominate I think in the same way that you Ariana can buy it by like you're putting out all the damage of killing Frontline do these damn things you're really going to be more reliant on the rest of teammates to do that and he's good-looking worst kind of get Access Sports company's actual champion pics of bring back out they have a ton of people fighting Gates have a great backlight in a zero and a half of a black Westside it is a lot of CC as well the first is there but they are not all completely consistent team fight damaging was Jen does not do it does not do what his ear does and neither do mordekaiser but it is spread out if what dies the other three can pick up the slack the percent Health Payment mordekaiser brings out since you build Health that's fine to go armor that's okay it is going to help to force diversification in the itemization on the TL side we'll see if it's going to be enough still has been absolutely outstanding carry threat is like getting ganked a lot in the early again falling behind 0-2 he was a bigger Force overall in game 4 on the set is not another payment Champion here with the mordekaiser the old can go ahead and break the or adults we can't spend more people he can prevent spiders from coming through Play The Objective games can be excited watch I think so too in the end as far as DLC goes this is the most tlcup they could ever go for a right to essentially have to hide damage dealers for your marksmen for your mid laner a bunch of tanks in calendar for tax time you play front-to-back v e v that is how to yell. Where they are that is how they went on a 16-1 streak new playing this style like very few mistakes and just waiting sitting back fighting at dragons out to you fighting their opponents so they are fully in their comfort zone here they have a playmaking fork or JJ I think that is something that a lot of people have been really looking forward to seeing obviously did have some Playmakers drafted in this series but anytime he is on that far to just such a threat especially for Champions like gin if you ever look for an ultimate that's such an easy answer from the barges you have that down pat because you don't have a dash or anything like that you're going to be largely Reliant often times on the Thrush Lane turn to actually in void any sort of Bart ultimate for the engage yeah and it could be fun to watch what ignore can do on this truck because he's been I think a big part of life like us are good I do feel the entire team hits really well I think they're a lot of excellent players overall but it. Getting back on a playmaker is a big deal he's hooks are good as Lancaster good his watch play length of the jungler has been outstanding the man just has so much work to the fly Quest Squad and so him back on. Rob is really beneficial of course as much and so on the bar in a box of those as well and it really means we got big threats of Champions watch for on on every front here right toppling can be very volatile Odyssey see it a lot of gang set up it don't just want to show up there as you rinse in drunken obviously be huge game turning Champion as well so down the line exciting things to look at here every lane could be worth going to dissecting and spending a lot of time on because anyone could going to take that game of their own hands I agree and I think something else that's kind of interesting wrinkle here is that TL is often a team that likes to sit back in and give up early dragons and then can test as a third Dragon when they're playing this style of composition they want to get in their comfort zone They want to scale up and then fight there I think that style specifically becomes more difficult when you're playing at the mordekaiser because if you give up those first two dragons if your flight was getting to that comfort zone and then you go to get tested after drag your jungle gets more Dalton all of a sudden it's 0.45 Quest that can be potentially series ending well we are on the rest for the series ending game it's game number 5 flyquest and Team Liquid to look it up the back of their best regular season record ever number 1C heading into playoffs after winning for championship titles in last 5 splits are staring down the barrel being not to lower bracket by flyquest when I get right back to the second-straight LCS final third place regular season and second place finish in Spring overall see if they could do it here with Champions on the rift playing a fairly low risk style there is a deep word for impact metal tracks of the Jungle starts with C in figure out which side of the plate do to be really excited one honestly not much surprising as far as of the ruins or or starting starting set up here and be the only thing that I was a typical on the car feels funny to say it is actually the most out of fear of long time ago but they taste almost exclusively so even when you're against very non-threatening you thought that you could come running but he is going to have your higher first potential so you do threaten more of the hundred is gross style of singer that that you're always kind of worried about as an opponent to it but your survivability or got a Dodge out from Skillet Johnson and I think like that is is much lower with this style I want to take belt support saving one stack for the second way if you were thinking of going to take us to the turret that means use on cooldown his little bit of damage but trying to wave hair back and forth but if a little too not the hugest power Spike on all sides would have went out Breitbart learn a few at level 1 or you have to the sun didn't put a bunch of Health relics down for Jensen the middle and he went for Lane dominance but as the day goes by little to no big heart. Going to be equal Farm since like 11 to see if the 10th we can pretty comfortable down there been fairly strong later and none of these guys really going for a super laying down and support so I don't really see any big advantage on either side I do think it just mostly about skill matchup. Okay what do self-published picked up just fine I like that lyrics are wait until after Turtles W that is the correct to Place Lane out make your teammate mrs. kill shot is there big night was burned you was burning inside as well Sinners down mostly as well as damage goes in the process is he going to face it was brush I will stunt you a storm and we'll take this fight back if I bought me was over but it is still damaged his recall for that a rock that has both take their fists camp now Santorum looking to get box cutter with will definitely help the ability of his watt Lane to play aggressively and run straight through midline Power Wheel pushed out if he needs it doesn't look like he does he is going to get his double so good and I wonder if Vicki vack do that to me to put they have committed forward to the all then you know if ignore walk forward and actually took out both was hell trying well chords DJ was he see now because he doesn't have that to retreat back to you do you have the damage that you can shut off but that's always one of those really scary moments to try to commit all the way forward to that because of the volunteers behind them and then you could just really look silly people Temple asked you are going to Bentley dive in. X out and she's just throwing a 1.3 that's the second at you when it's not going to go very well but now it looks like the top side of the jungler is coming so nearsighted and that is a nice cake. A lot of time was spent on Camp lead and I'm going to feel good yep been feeling really good about that a lot of it on the graves to stop being efficient evil to win any sort of jungle dual if you run into your opponent taking can't consistently throughout you can see the rock that is going to be even try to take back these rappers get a little something for pain for ensuring on the top side of this is important because you did do double Scuttle and Brock that likely will be a bit behind as a result of that may be kept as you can in special because Santa run is now going towards the top side and rocks will let that little Raptor it's going to delay the response on those rapper Thrift in foreign quite a lot Aguilera forgot to Seagraves went around his left side Jungle Book for walls right now and rocks it to the Jungle grows very very early taking his life for this one you can see if they're hot. Now covers it says okay are you on this Jensen pushes down
