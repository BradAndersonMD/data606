we're not putting the onus on the players in the situation was talked about this scenario is as we enter Champion Select the game 3 it's our turn to take Celexa will be walking you through this one is a first couple bands at the table by Jack u t l playoff hope it's dire even in a 2000 weekend you know they're still likely to end up in a tiebreaker at back for sure and because of what happened the first two games the theoretical possibility of 6 teams getting tied at 9 and 9 is still open if I lose this one and a flag in playoffs with a win here so it's super important for them if he's here then award-winning either of their game would keep Team Liquid out of playoffs because they have no way of getting tonight and the top six would all be at 9 already so we know the Team Liquid is looking forward to that cloud 9 game they have tomorrow but really it's all about the chew o they can't make any mistakes in the pressure's been on them the entire weeklooking for the 2-hour let's take a look at Champions like then and what they are choosing to eliminate in terms of options from flyquest pool that would be the set the pantheon and the center. I saw I find an interview that they're looking for the Rio more than the two of his if you get too low and you missed the tiebreaker I think that breaks your heart even more than then having to ten in the lck over about the past we can ask it got banned for most of the games in LEC and I kind of thought that Rose to prominence so quickly that we might not even get to see it in the ALCS the day I think it is absolutely the type of thing that Dublin core JJ can have high game and who is on so the fact they were able to get it I think it's promising or with tactical once I thought they even played it a little bit ago with SS and I know I was a little hit or miss on for JJ's Tarik what key does actually have one of the best Teryx if you think that showing at Eric days when they were spamming this just last year without a doubt they can use it as a flex right so it's still red side and Calista stop my guess would be that this is going onto going on about laying block nearly as well if that duo does go to the bar lynndale be up against the lovers in xayah and rakan another Power a power couple if you will be later picked up there right away powerview will blindly choosing the Sims right into Jensen's Zoe as a response I like it I think it gives you one of your powerpyx picked away from Jensen I think Center has been his best chance presented and it frees you up from having to sneak a lot of bands and some Midland so you can Target Bronx a little bit harder which is half the number of games in the second Fantasia's where they take away the lease in and in a couple of his best chance and it does seem to have impact on slowing brought down the early game both teams are playing for Jungle Band tear in the second phase 3 off the table already at least send signature picked Abraxas still available as of yet bundle as well I mean it would be boring but Rex I suppose so. I'm a little surprised to see the j4 band prioritized over the lease in Van I think you just count on leaving too hard to execute and you're probably okay taken sejuani trundle if you have to and then there's always a but there's the Rockstar syndra to combo it again because trundle would be able to counter I think because they're Zoe the cleanse value is too high I was surprised it wasn't just this is Justin Moore early games but if you're willing to do that I would have thought they make your own bot Lane with the least Cynthia theater and we'll see how you know where he said it's really good but they grab that here but I don't want to play that directs I personally better for them but I guess they have a lot of options at least got one go button in the Recon so I'm figuring that maybe Center scatter to to get a pic but a very solid team comp your flag Last Stand guarantees are later themes by over the LIE cuz if you hit mid-game when your lead-in find anyting you're doomed where I'm at least trundle Taylor can help you set something up and try so I don't think it does much with cinder in the early game versus snowy I would have liked to see something a little bit more aggressive by the jugular cuz D Ellis all early game here basically Zoe trundle might have a hard time trying to keep up in control that I love the rain but either way like we said both of these teams came looking looking to put together a two-out or as promised mentioned maybe a 300 weekend including a tiebreaker to sneak in the playoffs and defend their Championship on the flip side flyquest to at one point was being touted as the you know the true Contender to Cloud 9 has struggled recently brought so low in though and are really looking to see if he can be kind of the the glue that brings together the final product of flyquest living in the pussies any final thoughts too many of you gentlemen before we head into our 5-minute competitive Integrity break I love the spiciness of TL games there's a chance they miss playoffs after waiting for splits in a row is just too much every games enthralling back here in 5-ish minutes for game number 3 see you then I can talk hello everyone welcome back to the show LPS is beer a time that'll be back alongside the guy that way hopefully gets directly at the sale directly good job I'm proud of you that's a good start so yeah I mean obviously we are in the last week of The Elephant Back of the Season we are no closer to knowing which teams make it in the playoffs because almost every game we could have had so far could have locked the team in or out of playoffs and haven't gone that way yet so we still don't know it's pretty crazy that we are only one team has a lock I feel like traditionally going into week 9 a lot of it is already kind of locked out if you're playing for a spot or two at the bottom we still don't even know second place right there seems have nine wins and now hundred these is one of the amino up there with Aflac West TSM EG all these teams that again nine Immortals just behind them at 8 and then TLS 7 hoping that they can do something miraculous this weekend and catch up but it'll also require some of these teams to drop some games yeah and that's what it comes down to I know. hard for them they've got I like by far the hardest thing to schedule they're playing the teams that are literally right now never one and two in the standings they have to at least do one game better than Mortals and over a hundred thieves have a chance of getting any better move the tiebreaker scenarios afterwards so I mean that is tough for them that's what I think. Of the NLCS was talking about coming in and getting ready for the game was just like how does your four-time defending champion who only switch one player out I should have been probably an upgrade how are you still in the situation 16 games in and and you don't know what it's going to count them out until it actually happens when you miss 100 thieves to get 790 like yeah son at these results, you know whatever but here they can if they show us the level that they have over last year's but if they're showing at the level that they have a split I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to go to write like more reasonable expectation for a win is Asar second but it is a four-way tie for second right in their significantly behind first so it's kind of this mishmash between 2nd and 5th right and I think that is a chewable obviously flyquest could take them down also especially after how good Cloud 9 look today I mean they just dominated EG was been looking better than TL in recent weeks and you've got to beat them right C9 has basically taking every single team down in 30 minutes or in that one TSM lost that they had so she'll has their work cut out for them but people do still have that glimmer of hope because they know how good this team and look they know how good rocks that has been in the past individually and you you're just kind of thinking in the back your head if they can ever make it click like you know they should be able to then this is a really scary team and I think
