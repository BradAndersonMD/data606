and if not I hope to lock their spot in the final four 830 Suite of Cloud 9 let's see here Fanatic sticking to the same bands was Billy and Norton Alice rc9 again a collie irelia and it take away the pain that was perfect by fanatics it really does seem like a caps here at the Natick with the extra hand as far as the Assassins Midway give him a doll with a defensive wrong and victim was not take buy C9 as an answer it in the bottom Lane Connecticut and Angels, fix that we've seen a lot in phone as well as well as I like the sanitation department Havelock in the Lucian the first base finally was consistently band away and it's the only goal is the allister this is what they wanted to play it's what led to a lot of victory in the afreeca 309 18 and 1/2 that back to the power they really want in the bottom lamp open the first game and brought over DeWalt fanatic with. Elaine possibly walked in here and I take rocks can be shifted to the Jungle but likely Bozzo lanes blocked in where is 594 Jensen licorice has a deeper champion pool feels like more answers then Jensen has mad as far as the mid lane goes maybe they want to jump on something quite as many play over and over here right now do we get a tank top from a Christian and she has been as far as if you're looking for a tank answer and that is another one that they could go with but yeah there to listen to they want to lock in forged incident over and over again and I can I come through for fanatical Reckless on another hide image DMV and he was a big Force than previous game you can have a decent chance of here and Rec. During this final what could be the final damaged say I left my photo series at least your power yoga burst damage as well as a single Target knock up there now and you can go for more creative jungle gang since we're the ones where you'll see going over walls behind do a lane or top laners diesel okay and then go round 2 on the echo top the face up with the SUV fix her up there and it seems very likely this is going to be in 51 Whipple had his way with licorice you might also see these Champions switch roles has the bus to go back and forth I'm going to be interesting to see which player if it is the echo vs Vick the top and make it a bit more jungle attention to what first Jensen had a famous Echo miss out before they going to get it or Licorice and it is that Echo and Victor locked into the top laners go to the top not a guarantee that this matchup payment from Prince Gareth ended up backfiring he died also after rocks ahead already going to be late as well so junglers a huge amount of weight on their shoulders in influence the early Lane pay for the seller Lanes in which one of these guys can actually take over the game it's going to be an exciting one here Cloud Nine sacks against the wall that one coming in as the hole for the West European Champions they were the ones people had pegged as the Dark Horse to make the Deep Run and they have three in a row now to make it to the final the first time you're done that at all against the team but they had beaten in the Invictus so much confidence so far they have been a far better team compared to see 9 and we'll see if I can do it here Cloud I must make this three in a row over the wall early on as they can sneak in behind anyone my pee is a soul sitting in this with Russia and he's waiting on his cool down right now straight line of anticipation for the prompt you a dustland so therefore accuracy would you have a defensive for a while but that is about it everybody after sing happy to back off and just be normal red stars for both junglers but we'll see about the passing as far as which lane they want to influence first it right now for Natick were protecting for the level 1 and base it actually happened also and came on Wednesdays will have to throw him and he walked in and forced blocks away from the Red Bluff get to take his own blue on top side and giving her the advantage over to see now but not this time so I guess the best odd possible with a giant Leisure grow from Richmond Hill a thing as well that's the word Rock was in the middle of my brain as well as three autos on the way out go to almost given up that help trade I think and the right back at the start of winter anyway it's slightly in his favor Spencer actually started the sweeper here I've been trying to take down this Scuttle words before he moved over to the top side of the map is this time around kind of like we set up and game number one of the options were just going to try and split the map here and close off the top side in that to allow licorice is solo 1 V1 time in this match of the really trying display the Fon to Victor on the top side will go and grab his own bump on the bottom side of love to do this like red bump into a ham always watching for signs of objectivity away that we can help but not a summer spell as a very aggressive Frank out of Brock send the whole lot for it besides they go past four visits and Peridot making another fast lyrics just in case set him up though and broxah will be able to chase down when he pulls out of the jungles fence guy coming back secure his own right side with the Midland pushing against fanatic wedding it would have been pretty slow here but first game with the flash on fixing pull from fanatic and the rest I take the big surprise so far so good for him still has a bunch of broken coaching staff as well. Phil had his post to the Layman TalkBack checking in on the bottom line here Lucian bromwick freaking freaks for a lot of bottom Lane presence has been able to push in but Reckless and he'll saying doing just fine in CS there actually a head and a couple extra minions might be able to text right back up 40 Glen down here not a huge surprise just yet we're going to wait to see if the Big E wrestler places them in a classic rock to make it a lot more, 59 squat so what about play walk into the feathers right behind them with to call back right they're able to the spring the Trap takedown sneaky and a fire first blood for Fanatics see you to set up again why is it such a big problem now because this was the big change for you and the draft we've seen the echo already miss alisandra what solution pick in the first face it was always the second phase grabs it this time around and now he's losing YouTube Reckless Landing snare on to him or fanatic way more than just the first Blood itself to across-the-board a great start here for the EU LCS Championship victories over in Europe they lived in the shadow for quite a while but a couple of Victories here he looks like during the roster this number on Whipple is well in this year and it's been a very good run now winning in their official last game in the semifinals cat is Stephanie been the best way to bounce back and become the number one team in Europe to come to power house again that every European pain always look towards but it came out to International performances fanatic a bunch of everything right in 2018 Reckless has talked a lot about it and so in interviews as well I'm about his confidence in Houston this time around just feel like they're firing on all cylinders Cloud 9 fire around mid lane in Greece Jump Around tab the chairs on the wards they do the playoff they find the Ruby my cat has opened up that he will be in about 1839 went behind the near the game once again look to work MIT when Karen and brushes at least 30 seconds waiting Play Just A Pose Acro cats only a 300-hp has it on flash of course keep in mind around he's sitting with the team now on the top right of old stuff you can respect everything else if you go back to the trade you could have a couple more fights that was real cool. Sorry take that back and heard it in a fryer price of whippo get liquor going to be loved and liquor out TP is going to stay low in this Lane always tell if there's no ghost following you next time say spectator park that's that's on me I'm a better player than I normally I'm just rusty or terrible or something else who knows either way 600 goal difference in Cloud 9 L look at the bottom side with walking through it it's pretty easy brought the back off if they stay here from the draft with their Lucien Brougham some attention to work this Lane and see if they can I should push it and potential Tower die or just take the turret it is the first color by number to Reckless but we see the lot of pressure around bottom side wolf Houston free big reward then the night away regardless but it is money being lost the map right now to the pressure it's not a Killa but it's several hundred gold lost all the same potential moving down there is no CC from Jensen before speaking on our way even cash sitting in a broadsheet hiding out of vision he knows he doesn't need to work although he just needs to have the chance to call that he's missing from Midway wash out the cell phone for just about his healing is cut in half to re-engage will take some dance pretty quickly as well as coming off rude. But all Lanes at the moment trying to keep fanatic bottled up and force them into more expensive place hours has the little bit of success purely on is all the vision control in the river is on cloud nine side Table Rock Lake Forest mettawa play table to find the kill here and now they can put out the Top Lane this is going to completely cure for fanatic MattyB can't rejoin us a really good thing there for the EU LCS Champions 900 gold ahead when it across the map in or even bought me looks pretty solid exact time through our names to keep the pressure going in the early games they even have to brush to blow a splash on the first gang and not get anything for it with Intel Jones Farm Lane Boy by the trailers and now we're at the GameStop side from branka to give them a kill maggots is completely getting ahead of his game definitely respect you but I was laughing today setting themselves up looking towards IG and house dominating they were in their semi-final a lot of hype that's where the possible final matchup between those two teams and it does look fanatic Savory butter does not out-of-reach just yet I do want to keep ourselves on what sealant can do so far in this game only a thousand apartment for the break-in bridge that got really close as far as I'm concerned and it seems to be a pretty free pick up here as well so I think we are up in Arms Reach here in game 3 by mind force must make a reverse sweep three in a row and that is a prayer for everyone North American sayings during the Phoenix players themselves this series
