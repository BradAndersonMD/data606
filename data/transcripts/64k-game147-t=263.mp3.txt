Ghana's kind of logic art battle CLG with the dubious honor to the only team left with one win but they did look a whole lot better today came back the four times in the head is not accurate 61459 450 SM Immortals if they win are actually tied for second place which I think is far beyond what a lot of people work for this is Muddy there a fairly enough it's not that they're playing perfectly but they are picking up wins right and I think the saddest know very good for them early on in the team versus Team who I think their goal is goingp-play Austin's making it there at and trying to come through from that point they've been looking a lot better than some of these death squads of expected big things out of early on NBC LG or those teams are looking at us and top free top scorer in ligue 1 and 4 it look like and what is the squad was crowned in the middle and he has not been having a good year very very low damage or actually worse The Landings at Fannie middle interfere in the league right now and it's been all falls to fix that yesterday or the day before I do want to see if it's akin to put on another cave appointment for youyes you did pick up a win an Academy but before that it was like six seven losses in a row from if you hadn't played all of the Academy games so I know that that is a bit tough I think mentally to get through I'll just have to remember that they did get their win with the rock on a Friday night and I don't know if they're going to be able to get back to that pic is that will be left available in a session we are going to the second round of mad that you want to go for that type of play so I would not be surprised to see a Band Away by Mortals if they're at all concerned about it be what's the orange the Middle Lane and and hold on for the final counterpick but he's very very likely we should be sick next Once the bands are Real Steel gym grab their support either so that's going to be a fairly equal trade is a lot when there's an orangeMaytag Customer 80 damaged I don't think you're really going to want to give over this Ira Khan combo for free I guess you end times harder than ever I go but there's so many I don't think it was one absolute must fan and generally speaking diet only really play with her, these days at pro-level people feel that it is because that's that's fine I was going to play you know whatever so who cares what I was going to come through as the next go to engage support I still am quite possibly one of myself but not going to grab here just to Sandra Nautilus and now you get to seize the LG having to show who's playing Top Lane in and then let that orange pick the matchup we know rumbles like 3 midir for frown and I will see what ruins in a black pictureprobably drunk Appian what are the things that you're always going to give people talk about when they go to Nautilus is the liability I put my mouth on the 1st and I pressed or if they're going to get knocked up right where you can be the owner also passed away from Daft away from avoided many different ways and that is where I think the kids during a lot of times when these two Champions are being compared but it is going to be the owner with the possibility of diving on to die a year is a very strong Hill Lane Leona can walk people down for The Misfortune ultimate you do have the ability especially post sticks for the hundred to zero combos now the objective lens Off winner atrox oclock bin of note Soraka was still available to be picked was fan to pick their so now the mortals can Flex in shoes the top laner they want to play still got to be if he was a top of a magnet last time around now what is it going to be enough and Ohs up there and it could have been staying up top and his beer coming into the mid laneokay very interesting so it is going to be a deer into Rumble obviously you are going to outrage the rumble quite a lot but Rumble does have very good push in the early game no pain pain of a block is your under the threat of times and it's here is much more of that ceiling pick you do need time to get things going Rumble as soon as you hit stick to really are ready to go to fight around these objectives Aika it seems like it's going to be kind of that late game and there's a tremendous amount of scaling on the immortal side if it does go late I fear fear of their mom's very heavily when you're a kid and considerations the guaranteed engaged and Nautilus and Horn the or upgrades as well as diet and his gear for those big hypercar eat in the late stages but feels he has a lot of ability to be able to make things happen early great ganka to stand there with his Leona Group up with Lisa and make things happen along side of very powerful a leaf ultimate with the rumble of mass that is really great fighting a new subject has and that really has kind of been the name of the game into a petall right well here we go comps on your screen to get more dog chance to start but it still got was so good last time might just see it again it'll be just me one notch for I think it's worth looking at Immortals as a squad what they've done so far this year they had actually year-long a very very bad early-game them and coz the only spots under a thousand average gold deficit at 15 play slaughtered the early game last time around if they can stay on that form I sent a whole lot of work done for them and I think so much that credit is deserved or that early on the rack. I really felt like he was everywhere make multiple trips up to the topside be able to get advantages for so as what she's been made good on we know he can get similar things done on the Elise another really powerful early-game gankerI will see what he has in store for us here in the immediate things I'm looking to and it is that very surprised by the barrier on Rubble here for crown that is not something I've really ever seen taking hear nobody Rumble generally that is very very common and throw down the warden at least that's not a huge loss but have to burn the trinket and you know Gabe Solis you see a lot of class right and there's a ton of CC there but that being said barrier is if you dwell no really really powerful defense of Sumner you know what is going to absorb more damage than you would kill you for so that can be quite nice and if you're looking at a potential kind of aggressive plays to be scrapped shield and barrier it can be surprising how much you can really absorb them on one of the recent nurse.Rumble was that Frank one's craft shows got nerve quite heavily and that is the last kill you actually do level of which means you're going to be sitting on that Nerf capture really was about twenty less shielding I believe it was already in the past was like 13 days but I'm pretty confident that's the Centre change regardless of what we've got bought literally push your people to Squaw Taco Bell and it'd be pretty easy trade back PC smoothie sits in front says I'll be the one thing to yank her I would ask you right back and get my contacts back on so that was just your problem I think my husband is back and forth yeah I kind of expect when you push year but that being said there is potential to kind of combat that MF does a pretty good push up her own and we are going to see them take this timewhere is always really nice and kind of get Award of a bit further into your bonus jungle you're off and going to get more information from this he sees that the crowds are actually up with his word that he get placed they're both these camps have been warded Redbox was the start which we already know is gone so just give you the information that we went to the topside and as soon as we leave goes anywhere down that bauxite is going to be one of those to Camp so they're going to have the information where he would be how to stop then we'll see if the leasing can get anything done at all then it's going to be a Farm Fest of note ruin has the highest jungle proximity of all top laners as Wiggly ends the topside jungle he's up towards with a stop when you're pushing trying to push Pops that came through as well and look at the chickens are his and make sure that's going to stick junglers cosecant squared it out and it didn't see who knows he's still up on that top side knew he hadn't shown on Ivy'slittle Raptor alive they're worth very little experience as far as the total picture so it's almost always worth leaving one little Raptor up just as a counter jungling movie it's so much experience is in attic rafter and how does a three-man play specially for them it might be done and very similar CS overalls with you going to stay out of the map actually it was the bottom side of the predicting the lease and recall and maybe he can come off at Crooksyeah we'll see if he does catch him there will be going to kind of get a little bit of the bad news is that timing it was a little bit later we realized you were started that camp and then if you send us don't want it, because weekly did actually spotted on the way over there and his father is closer it's really too risky flavors for Crown oculistas bottom side of hello from a w a t Point Shield of rank one so it is free Nerf trap shield and Crown feels comfortable enough name is coming out from the year that crime has to be respectful and if we can or were you pretendingturn the flash on Chrome Twitter flash of the Cuban chose not to laugh. Why didn't the flash for that killed that that's a guarantee field even if someone comes in actually get you afterwards that should have been first weather for crown and honesty a pretty big mistake it seemed like from Aika I think he just did not save a soldier to actually be able to leave at 4 it's been frowned recognize that went for the olym play if you hadn't even without though I think that should have been a kill us a recall and release some Lane pressure but yeah that could have been so much bigger in the mid lane and Crown who's been having troubles this year finally Landing face even if only moderate the question is can you make good on that is being down the flash because if you can maybe we'll be able to call up smoothie and try to make it 3 minutes play try to get something done there there's no plans. He's gone I got so the owner + weekly coming over if you can maybe punish that but I think that should be the focus for CLT for the next coupledo you really want to get something out of that all right now it's back to farming for the jungle as he was real in Spanish oven tops item had the decency to pick up a lot of it again W look at all that beautiful a we damaged and I see cleared out there and if she's back up to actually get wrestling is a really good thing I'm by so as I'm sitting pretty much dead even here with ruin we knew that we knew was playing a lot on that table setting that because of the wording of Dave done so he was going to have to sit back in the early Lane that is kind of weird war and can sometimes get an advantage in these Millie matchups and that was taken away from him so much for being up Farm in that situation because Russian for friend as you have a topical stuff today and going to get caught. If I ruin and we can see some Midland freshman out a little bit at barrier plus the Mercury very very defensive setup your broken crown see what you can get done it is Xfinity moving his way towards mid-length and it was forever for a bit of a playcare I think Immortals are are sensing the fact that heals you may want to try to capitalize on that flash being down so they were trying to beat me in that area to difference is gone entirely that was burned to get the minions back for Icon yeah he's still up about a wave a farm over also add really doing what I would look like with a kill for Crown but and the day of the game state where it's a lead in the bottom side Roofing a difference as All That Glitters Is out but I'll take a NyQuil have been having a pretty big Lenny face with lace and Missy going to find us. Louis stolen but pretty good just walk away back to his teammate the blue steel gun was really good against this year and that was most 1hp bi-weekly donation of that flew Bellefontaine be happy to receive it just break is going to go over with the pickle outfit year 50 Gold by yourself and indeed grab that one remaining $200 plus the consequence of blue steel I've been worried about that so give them a bit of an edge there and help them to maintain the event they've already paid for themselves one of them spells going sister fanfiction X-Men and a half or so so not too much time until I can has that flash back in about a quarter of that cool down black soap but over a minute and no visits really from CLT to wear that Midland so no Advantage now
