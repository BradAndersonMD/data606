welcome to Champion Select for the spinal semi-final of Worlds 2018 I am so freaking with Kobe and officio fnatic vs Cloud9 for the last spot in the finals of the biggest n Avers to you match property of all time it is extremely exciting first pick up and face and wearing some pics on both sides people looking at it really ought call different states at same here in the semi-finals and then Dillion Nocturne 2 of this key picks for top nine something else we're looking at with Cloud 9 games what's the difference between group stages early on for sneaky and then once he started playing Lucien in the bottom way since we're looking at Mark Smith is already be another one that did rise to the top because we can do something very different and interesting pick right here by fanatic hoody entirety of the main stage of the world image of Cloud 9 has always band Tom tent it's such a good counter to their aggressive StyleX gear not at world only to the summer split open now it is in a blank space pick we saw this yesterday in game three between i g and G2 it simply saying we are so confident and I'll mid laner and whatever mashup we going to get in this Lane that we will be able to play around Tulane that we can just grab it early on plus it just re-emphasizes what we are talking about with the mid laners and junglers important put on these four players they've already invested very early on Fanatics the midnight fix but your Cloud 9 invest into the jungle by Raton from fanatic I assumed was seeing if they were not take away the braimport finds web also showed us because the star of the top way there and the scores of solo queue for many it's so annoying to play again because of the rain messed up what is a blind Victor so he didn't know already that he's going into a tankie champion and you're something easy to use kleptomancy again he's actually confident up to your nipples going to get licorice that it could be blind yeah I want to see if teams have been the last couple days find encounters to Victor give us blind bags for liquor stores have a chance to last pic also want to see now playing Bossa combo is used in Florida am I the best strategy so far vs. Victor has been in early pics I can set up your jugular four gang key they already have a Sims out jungle for possible early Gang Kill Victor before he gets the cooldown reduction and the upgrade for his text core weldernow is a Finchley Premier bottling take right here the unassuming Jackson Jungle Band or maybe it's Christmas to me earlier because obviously we've got LeBlanc and Victor playing Phil not a major Spock player does. He's very good into it and I was not really a lot of thinking from last year's season wasn't bad and the Cassandra can oppose get flex but I want to see Sandy Old Town of akin to Victor let's hearcould also be a mid lane Echo and shifting love walk up to the tops died and farm it out and then use that was how to actually settle after this Lobster around twenty-second group I'll remain up in the air telling me about this is going to be the kind of think it's going to happen. Okay let's see if anyone will actually do it tonight I'll have to swap it around but they have 15 seconds even the chance the players flop around as well we've seen Timur like before as well as the other lane Golf Course AP damage and what are the items that Victor top weight has been brushing aside for solid because of the large amount of cooldown reduction and Mana help with the shield and the speed with off your queue nowgoing to be an alteration to build a little bit and you get Abyssal mask in the case of magic damage instead was not quite as perfect as not going to be as damaging you almost never be in the orange hat cogo xin'an use the pope movie select is Scott moir new and exciting pics the blind Victor the echo top it's going to be an exciting game a very fun graph to watch and the last remaining hope that the two major western region Europe on the left North America on the right ventricle to the love is gonethe game has begunwelcome to summoner's Rift Europe versus North America semifinals at Worlds the best performance either reasonable has had seven years if you can make it to the final here so much building up to this match and we're now in the last few seconds or you can expand the EU of a day and chat because it is about to catch on fire I mean one region will make it to the world final your the region will get trash talk for a year so a lot on the line here for both fan bases and solutions for the Victor when it comes to his atomization because we got to see the iPhone going to brush when he was against sings Like A trucks and the armor was super beneficial hard for it looks to kill him obviously not going to be the same effect against an echo and this constant threat that you can jump you with a jumper and you can always close that Gap and get on to you exactly that's the key thing for me because Victor top actually does a lot of scaling but we'll talk about that later because there's already an invade here that's been seen quartz rocks is going to back off until his bottom Lane does comes and Beyond don't know they were spotted at 3 didn't see the ward that medic put down into the left hand side could not be swept out a lot of really wishes on both ends here is there still battling now for the Red Bluff three-on-three down here to wait this way to get to defrost it going to give up the control as Liquors nobody but when the topside the Q canal and fit more damage as well speak not off to a good early start getting his passive there for the extra speed now the big difference on this invade is the midline or push Jensen in the Midland as Alessandra he pushed away that was not on screen but he got control over the Midland hair priority is what we call it and cats could not join so they had to give up that but I like this. How about from C9 actually happen against fanatic when they play in the quarterfinals in the first game from support always leads the way here now has a wart spotting since Karen so he knows he's on his way into his jungle is it taking the long Route Around Redbox and see how you do not especially with the soul Elaine's getting the push on the minion waves that we have seen that was actually going for the gank rather than the Scuttle crab right now getting of whip and want to get that income going already brought that you can see his transition that's the bottom side already on lease in and he may just have to focus on that area as there is a lot of fish in there either their division I wrestling fanatic on desktop site the Goldsboro that had a warden the wrath of Sparta Cent gun walking into the jungle and Waco had a ward in the Top Lane try brush it with a spot in his balls out as well so they knew okay if he's not in any of these places to eat fairly easy to track the jungle the first part time from Jensen and it gets hit all my God I want to set up great play there from Captain place to get that's why we put the importance on the mid jungle Duos here in this matchup flashing in securing that kill and getting the Summoner spells down in half of all of Cloud 9 games with the Enemy mid laner giving up first Blood of all 10 players the map fanatic at 3 minutes turned you want to start the animation of not able to react in time either way I could play right there and this is the fourth a good start 654 fanatic is betrayed keep having to the topside and I got to say it's been pretty good for a liquor shop at liquor to me having a counterfeit so far to that first pic Victor yet what the biscuit delivery as well does going to come in to help him sustained through that they keep up the pressure house with top Victor as well it's very boring to keep track of the room choices even if you are forced to go in the magic resistance area you can take Transcendence for some cooldown reduction at levels had but again it still takes a while to scale up on that dick Korra comes extremely effective bottom line now they're going in for a little bit betrayed level of play but either way I hope I'm not getting punished for being jumped in at all and that's going to be pretty equal for this bottling is plus vs fnatic either he gets all three of these he will still be down turn face in I did not value. Lucia in the first place that they wanted lisandra against the law to pick from fanatic which meant the times for bad Lucian and therefore not be too scared of the wrong lane specific kind of things from the grandpa and subtract using the series if seen on Parklane feel like they need more pressure for the next game they might value getting that Lucien piccard earlier but for now it is a scalene picks for sneaky same thing of you for reckless and that investment has worked out pretty well as far as the Cs Lee there or lesandro but again to teleport was also close to going it again in the landing feel pretty safe rocks won't take that 1:40 till he gets out because of an extra damage Jensen maybe going over too far forward to mount 1/4 can use it offensively stay alive feel like middle and it's where everything is happening and we showed this in the free game how cold to Atlanta pick up a bunch of quite a bit love to cancel Merlin pronounce fanatic it has been all broxah for the early game you know Spencer and went for the invite to push him off of his jungle Camp you went mid instead and got a lot out of it are you kidding me bottomley want to say something about it but just jumped over the walls are Spence Karen goes headlong into the gym here to just run away from a type of the first successful that seem like some frustration in our age of Predator replay addict level 6 is for both of these guys Ripple does GetGo the sun over there and he's able to get it back to get to flash out of the Stars most important here he's just running away from its nest cam does Cam get in and get enough hits on him be well Captain Brock set in stain he threaded that came through and was able to land it on the liquor it but the girls had already blown his ultimate in the attempted killing with photo shoot shoot early momentum here for the 1500 gold leave for the EU LCS sweethearts hear the last remaining hope for the EU LCS and they are looking very good so far now to find them at length we fight they take in mid or Top Lane a weave in and out of Minion waves they always get on to the correct Target and they just have enough damage to finish C9 Jensen ends up going down a little tray to feed Liquors walking back to list David Stanley this one again take away is licorice but never does he do for damaged and now he's just talked about 1/3 HP and not to mention to plot of my hero skills are going on the top side of the map in Midland in top way in the jungle as well but bottom line actually have we behind its yes because the zipper keeps pushing topside again do rocks and moved up he's going to provide some extra support forth with undercurrent now the echo not a lot of options and you saw that incident on Aging spinster and unwilling to fight rocks in the one-on-one better items by completed p.m. after this long for the 150 acres going for a bit lower the shield there will not be a re-engage Whipple playing so well with all this pressure 1 0 and 1 despite a partial Camp has been staring thing process control water with him after shock plus all the bills Atlantic City
