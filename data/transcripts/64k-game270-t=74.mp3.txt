You kind of come back and win two straight there is a rise band but he isn't tell us things to get rid of a call he's going to one of those still looking have even more a collie pics right now like a colleague matchups that you would even want with because of the Shroud like there's so many defensive way you can play the lane that even even matchup that can have an advantage becomes like pretty hard to really deny that champion LeBlanc has definitely been one as well irelia that spent on the band is still available one last band are left for Echo Fox vs I'm getting rid of an auction themselves worried about how good not forget that playing alongside of us are enjoying the break of the TV one kill doors that is a play style if you with a Collie make sense there and there's a really also dropped off as a would-be counterpick looks like it's just several toppling Vance put through by echo-fox that Kenan at the very beginning and really a gangplank of Houston didn't grab they wanted the Alice through all of it I'm not sure what we don't know for sure where it's going freckled Fox LeBlanc no it doesn't Zoe okay's do guinea crap we notice Pearson and now, we want to play a colleague into Zoe's or we putting a call again blind after I've and I feel like there's always going top for solo here we'll have to wait and see for the final lock in the show tsf TSM very correctly keeping their v v once again for Broken Blade then you're going to play Darling I'll wait a little bit longer to decide what midlantic going to play a part of what got echo-fox in the playoff was for straight Darvin game for Russian and he played it really well at this time around bottling should definitely have pressure I love that 212 you should be able to do that has pushed pressure as well you should be able to have a decent game here spindra maybe the lock in that can be solid have a lot of good Laimbeer garbage to be comfortable getting around the map yeah I do I do really like to send her into Zoe there whenever so we always try online if you're done here to call your jungle you go for all in pretty frequently on the Zoe Summoner spell Phoenix take the timer add extra defensive capabilities dealing with the trouble Bubble at 1 go spend the helicopter around the Shroud Splash damage going to tear that would work pretty well and then they swap back around Brooklet probably keeps the ignite will have to see you sound have a very aggressive team they can definitely get in Zoey Lucien can follow up. He have a lot of very good Lane that'll take at least favorite of the one on one But as time goes on that ship has been a lot of damage this is going to be so cheap here too because we're looking at Sindra and Daya being engaged upon by Alistar flashtrek side ekrem dive same thing for Zoe there in the backline Pearson have to be very careful cognizant of his position a record speed cannot be underestimated give me the final handshake of Houston for the split do or die for echo-fox they must win to straight to knock down TSN and make it up to the semifinals where Team Liquid or Cloud Nine oh wait and solo has done it before last spring it only got one more chance left now back to get the walls they have to win now Mega Man the crowd favorites is 2013 an even earlier for the first time ever TSM Miss finals in both splits of 2018 they are hoping to not repeat those mistakes here back in Springdale Austin quarterfinals do those players still Apollo and hot coil this time around 2 and one up they can easily make this series there's very quick Paws so asks pill? So we got a monitor issue for Buicks in resolving right now okay should be getting right back into it they have unpause so we are back in release and he will be the last one of the spirit SMS to my finals Echo Fox toe finger we are all in the wrist they have such a tall task ahead of them TSM seen as many by many players and fan as the strongest team coming into playoffs definitely the strongest team in the second half of the split a proven it with all of their victories 11 and 1 since week 3 I miss Siri still a pretty solid scoreline in with current form of the players look like they might close it out Echo Fox though they were counted out and then we're back in week 7 week 8 we started talking about which could make the question Fox wasn't even a team we mentioned their outside looking in with TLC 9 to play but it beat them both before and go run and they were going to Giant Killers but he is and maybe a little too big for them are they still hold us two in one leading the series then rushed waiting around of the Wings they are about to get one aggressive word to help try to track for the rest I might go in it and Kayden indeed is that is on Red Bluff that wore didn't provide too much value especially considering I put it down so he will know that there is one behind here that's why they're discontinuing with the Blue Bloods still here that Ward is it to see Acadian later on and it's past it is to make sure that he's not going to pop over on the blast Khan what is anything that's three games in a row and this one especially at the Box off thing into the vertical jungling we know right size for sure going to go Raptors to that chicken than in and take down that left side jungle so first game they opted into it and it worked out because solo had very good one V2 play on the top side playing on the weak side and it allowed Echo box to control the dragons of control the bottom side and get their Victory but ever since then broken plate has had better matchups Broken Blade has had more pressure and Kayden is a Trek size of champion that can go for Tower dies even if you are playing safely once you get access to level six over the back of this wall here with very few Champions can do this and go right there to do right behind the tower and right now of the Wolves to go back with the priest Altima Spot Lane right now but it has yet to take any of that jungle where is Russia's post that entire right hand side working late is pushing up to in the lane so you should have confidence of his top laner meanwhile bottom side exact same thing echo-fox know their Duo Lane they've got run of the Jungle here on the bottom side so they won't be inhibited going to get over here and you're pointing out y'all getting didn't get a lot of the early counter cycling's done so Rush is going to catch him red-handed Lancers might take the fire Lee grabs it but keep in mind the rest of camp and work till in a wait there was more form available so that was slick gets away from the pulverized if you make it sound like it was a great press release the jungle cast as well yes so this jungle Advantage does come to fruition if we have now a reverse clear from Russia and that is topside down he finished up meanwhile Acadian the only left the like what he's doing right now though because the only option for erectile when you have no count cat sound like that gang and his mid laner Phoenix is the prime gank Target so Rush instead of going to immediately clear that helps Phoenix push out the midways doesn't have any words but the game has a wart and it's Steve's rush now return to the Raptors my phone up for like one more second so taken back by Acadian pies up a little bit more but still right shoulder ahead and Rush up two camps worth of Cs and tops cuddles up right now for going to have the advantage are Russians not had a recall off and he has very little Mana do upgraded my so I can't even the only problem is mid laners just recalled Mike gets its cut over to a mid laner power and that's a big man eats your first Acadian they cannot contest York City's back in basement for the recall Phoenix is here so they collapsed echo-fox secure the Scuttle crab and Rush year does have the expanse advantage over Acadian for this game and they're mentioning as well you know the manner that you get back after spending the Scuttle crab in addition to the health very big in allowing the possibility of turning that fight around definitely important right here First Tee pees used topside Broken Blade going towards the cowl a finished extech revolver in for Solo in that matchup actually feel 40 equal in the ass so that's going better than the blind a truck payment on the blind a call into an all-right bot Lane Advantage TSM Wellfleet them despite the fact that Jarvis be able to spend more time bought by the way to get more farm land the bubble is Bjergsen but also up in form Pennsy it's really 5 to farm guess I'm doing pretty well jungle mattress advantage to Fox but not the length have your sim definitely has been extremely good over the series on Alessandro games very different Champion here and still wait for him there looking for those bubbles ocean ocean actually slips into the back of the word inside so he's been cleared out instead you really can not start up an ocean break this early in the game without knowing that the enemy will not come find you there it does too much damage it slows you will be caught red-handed you'll be killed and then the enemy gets to take it away so he should instead and then leave it at that for supplies and Jack backed away bacilli two-and-a-half Camp Elite overall on the echo
