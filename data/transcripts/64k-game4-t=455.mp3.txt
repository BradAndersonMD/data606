I want to be cool like this thing as part of the good parts of the origin roster they stopped him out for Jacksonville and it got worse so you know I don't I don't want to give anyone with TL exerts a is outstanding in Destiny was about to run has as well so just got lucky with you know we'll move on him and Mortals going to do the best as well but it's going to be it's going to go through gameplay can meal dropped out from Elsa and the seraphine bad I like this year from Team Liquid no more of the the baby proof bottom Lance for themselves at you mentioned as a coach do they have goes without saying first year for four and other previous play but it also means oh my God is so quickly here quick on the pantheon I hope he keeps it in the jungle because we are still free Nerf junglePantheon Earth where they made the Q reduce damage apply to Jungle monsters as well so we're in Zurich to get to make his LCS debut on the champion I expect to see what I can get out of that one is flying through in this draft liquid or do you like in their contents they've dropped somebody say figs here we get the yellow name for the side of Team Liquid on one of these assassins always love seeing him on the echo on the akkala even though people flame and so much for the one Echo Miss Donuts melee carries I love seeing the side of him I hate it when he gets relegated to buy ice farming and there doesn't move a lot from mid fool let's get that you own a in their al-fari on thea good counterfeit that he's showcase up in Europe arelio do picked up a Revenge this is goes really well with panty. Naked try and kill this cannon for sure you're all in is devastating with this combination I expect them to activate a Californian or question we posed earlier on the intro where are Mortals going to attack should be both Sidelines I think it was both very viable here with blitzcrank lock in on the bottom side to being able to break Shield hit those big hugs I am so excited we got a whole pack of new players on the side of a mortal that we didn't get to see in in lock in plus going against the Champions with this type of draft exactly what we were asking for a freak shoot for the moon and Mortals you're going against Team Liquid they just come off of Victory and you have a new Squad put together but you got nothing to lose. You can shoot for the moon and then lose 90% of it when it goes back that $50 which you know happening sometimes but it soonincredibly high-profile players in Alf re-entrant Torrid this is the roster everyone is looking at honestly I was kind of shocked they actually got brought to five games by cloud nine the file because they weren't they were stopping everybody they were the team to look at they had to drop the game until lock in finals with that roster there still my favorites to win World I'll just I'll say it for a while and then I can be the first one to be right when when identity happens regardless what is this is the team together and there are some very good names here and and look there's a chance they can win but the very least you look good here and then and where the heck we are going to play the title and it's a proactive graph they are looking to create place here you don't pick Pantheon and farm up free especially not against the New DealCersei this guy that I've been looking at from Europe really really have liked his Innovative jungle pass this guy has done your level to Red Bluff galaxy has done all caps into a bottom side camp like it he easily can can be the playmaker for this game and steal the show and enter the LCS with Fanfare and Is His Name In Lights also going on top of that he's playing Pantheon his team is Immortals and his name is their say-so the 300 memes are just going to be plentiful I know that you've already got like six of them he is literally playing what is there say the ruler of the Persian Immortals definitely going to be a wrapped up here top side though already Revenge going to wait in that brush the Canon you can try and arrange her ass there really early but you're really a big into that is supposed to be forno pressure is supposed to be hey Pantheon come up in point click Duncannon because then he's dead it's Pantheon clicks done into a rally is done follow-up and that is a dead your door so Windsor say starting blue intergraph can easily just go straight to read from here and try and gain topside it's it's very uncommon for LCS junglers to to do just three camp in to gank usually it's much more power clearing because you don't want to get cancer invaded on but yeah you know when you're going to get this line up and you do want to try and punish Doubtfire early it is an option will talk about in his in his you know play The Weeknd review was that like look you know junglers are all too strong right now so supports our support to make the place to junk those are not the ones doing that anymore so you know until we go to moorgate focus junglers it's got to be supports doing it does have his specssickle so it is chords JJ getting all the last it's still very possibly get a ton of damage output from the Senate of gold all that fun stuff we stopped at first but Sven play phenomenally a good day for the guardian Shield will not shop all right as the hooks start the land here we need to go into this matchup cuz I really love with Frank pics always into Tom can't you can break his thick skin Shield basically nullify the defenses of this Champion that that people will sometimes complain about plus you can get to 41 polls if he eats tactical from someone else's CC that you pull in the time catch to get both of them and you can still break the shield I just really love that as an answer for possible kill pressure since that has been our theme of this game is is looking at where they are going to apply that fit don't hesitate to the tripod first do double sweepers means they both knowVictorious the wire frame and those who stay there but can't see the super of the Wally there's like wait a second I thought I'd see new deer warts are gone and decides to give away control of the brush but yeah the number to hear they know Top Lane is where the shenanigans are happening son's going to land a Revenge goes into the play Flash The Flash face and it was nearly enough to kill off same tour that was so sick by Revenge drive there cuz you know if it really is going on that trade and you see that minion low house is going to jump right back to it On Cue he's hoping that he can do it quicker though that that's what that is he saying I have faster fingers I can fly and get my bear slap off before you queue back cuz if I do you're dead but a Revenge take that opportunity I had loved that he's playing on the edge this guy is not ahyped up as some of the other Academy pickups no heat it at smash Academy but revenge is Young North American talent at the top of the solo queue ladder love talking about how he went to bed school delayed his professional career and honestly it's showing some big brains right there so you know what give him give him the five bed he deserves it has been pushed in a pond at the farm league right now for the time catch Tomcats winning line-up against this guy so honestly Independence because the hook and it was going to kill you got about 14 seconds of stealing however you want that means they can walk up and and do some damage and indeed the potions are a little bit but we will have to jump through his potions in Spanish how far back up that was a great look like destinytruly was Destiny Atlanta a lot of these hear the opl All-Star bottom Lane coming in pretty hot as well no Bloodshed yet did not get a first blood out of the top side but I know Immortals are versus the lock-in Champion that being said they're losing that does start to add up on you that. Start to whittle away here as Team Liquid farming very nicely and the Midland where we talked about no Jensen on the yellow name he's forming extremely well for himself uses early teleport back but got rice backs of pushing and immediately upon arrival. A little too early for two seconds later you grab him out a hook and it's fine and said you gave it to me for one exactly it still means they're going to be able to push in on that Tower though as you said no no harm realDoug off of that Tactical for JJ have the advantage on bottom side pushing the first wave into the tower they are in the turret light themselves cash in there get there recalls off to reset as well and can get back super quickly you see the rush on your boots of swiftness here for Tactical for Santa gets out they're extremely quickly both of them rushing to Tier Two Boots and I love this watching your first recalls from bottom Lane you want to head out towards the middle of the map both of you so you have the option of Haunting the reset from your opponent if you want to head towards mid or pressure or head back to bottom land in since they did see Destiny clearing out the control word they just make a quick pivot tactical at by the way on your mini-map you can see he even stopped off at the red but it is very important for Senna to stack up as many Souls as possible you get guaranteed once off of just passing by if the timing works out with your uncle Ron what does campsnow you want to lay it down in the LCS freak and Mortals or Avenger makes it happen no fear he shows no fear on the top side with jungler around Bayside is Flash goes for the one do you want this is why you pick irelia for your aggressive top laner he got to the top of the ladder playing carries playing Riven so give him the irelia into can match up Revenge does it level six year he hit Level 7 off that minion stacked up his passive goes for the all income it's under the tower even with the ignite from al-fari back out to the minion so he doesn't have to take the extra Tower shot and earns them a topside Advantage santorin will punish with a dragon for himself as the bottom line it bad to still heavily in the favor of Team Liquid with tactical cord AJ pushing but this is a champion and Mortals here pulling off some big moves earlyhow beautiful play up there before the gold is still tied between these things because right now bought is smashing I mean absolute people suffer the TL Duo they are winning this Lane by far the first plate plus the Cs and of course with that they get the dragon as well so TSM take notes what your boss is willing come grab a dragon it removes the wind condition so far so good team liquid still picking up nicely but you got to give credit where it's due to revenge for taking down later in the LCS right now takes me to take the skill match up and actually blast it off so sorry yes for sure nobody else had even close to that was for solo kills in lock into those odds calculatorthese are the ones that count for the split Team Liquid do object is all going their way despite the celico despite the height and it's up there of one be wanting santorin is all over these objectives he has he has really really well. Of course this is what you do with the meteorite you are all about efficiency and farming and getting to the objectives that said though he is roughly equal Farm to their site but to those camps I was way more important it's a dragon and a red-tailed those are going to pay dividends in the endgame to look at have swapped they're doing after the topside Revenge thing alone up here and try to hide the fact that he hasn't called yet this is actually this is an outright 3 V2 problem is you're going to show up and show up with his out an easy fight anymore if they don't take this if I don't get something out of it well they willI was going to say if they don't make something happen here you are giving up a tremendous amount of Temple bottom side you see how far is pushing that wave in but they do free the patient's plays here from Revenge heated weights in the brush right until tactical walks into him there so deep in the lane with a blitzkrieg neither one can escape this is now three kills for Revenge blade of the ruined King picked up for 11 minutes into this game and if you are al-fari but you do not want the ones you want with him so he's going to back topside is goodbye could not get away for the rest of the combos three holes means to kill as much as we do you want to have time to throw the phrase is out how far he says yep I don't want the one be one with the threeAurelia I'm coming back topside will you will do the exact same play Team Liquid with the response another look at this play as you no tactical walks right into him into the brush actually look at the live cameras though because with the ripped out and then
