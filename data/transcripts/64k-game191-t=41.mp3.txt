welcome back for game number to this best-of-five keep this the first one you missed a lot of 44 minute of a game I do want in the lake game team fight and we are back around longer available and I wonder what a dick is game is going to counter with ears they're very slow with their second set of hicksLee sin already locked here they know they want this one of the Jungle pick for Ding and a play something volatile you have to imagine the size absolutely helpless sure but that was supposed to pick Jace I think it's important and we still actually don't know if Griffin is completely abandoned to guarantee that's a big question we have to try it again or they actually going to switch it up bass player three roles in solo queue as recently as yesterday they very much like the entrywaymy back to the expected Bottom lyrics here I appreciate your effort trying with the gerund pick themselves that you of course apartment pick was available to come back right away or even the very expect the bottom line here no surprises to Champions come through and wait to see what Chris come through later on in the Frat he's an opportunity to try and pinch Tarzan camping pool because they taken away at least in progress was pre ban Kiana's going to Lisa's gone and I also wouldn't be too surprised to see Jovi go with something like a galley on the Midway but we'll have to see when possible so I don't mine at least patio style bands to come out here in Champion by lightning is that it will notjungler also knocked out yeah a lot of your the cop gone gragas Panda weigh at least handle a wreck Side Band at least intake and we certainly need a jungler still for Griffin and they have left essentially rookie did find his counter magic without any further bands chords that one and now with a support needed as well as paw plan to look at the options between oppositely Ona everyone's you play against rakan Nautilus women walking for Bel Air with the bottom line picks so far and you can see they're definitely saving the Chive counter for last night's game in fact this is about a stent removed from game number one draw actually going up against the kale from the shy to Champion of champ the winky face can go I don't expect too shy to Win It game over block tops that we have, but unlikely we seen something very similar to this matchup already out of short it was again to wonders kale however what was interesting to me about that match vs was actually very close between those two all the way up until the mid game and it was the map to Pro for round the kale that ended up stopping him so I can definitely understand why the child would go something like kale and she's going to be able to just get to his strong point and then win match up against the best Korean tops over in China on the shy so I think he is confident it's going to be on the sword is most played by a mile and I'm excited about going to happen now that we got Viper with his diet and his hand to take over the game is beautiful Arena of Spanish viewers and we'll see what kind of show these players can put on for us now the second game here I she defended their world championship title Griffin naked when they're second-best to 5 it is many years since joining the lck we'll see if they can do that here we are on to the rift game number 2 as the bay skates drop we can do battle and always such a pivotal game in the best-of-five series how disastrous it can be to fall down O2 or how advantageous it can be 14 like igf who had multiple sweeps throughout their worlds run last year 3 owing the semi-finals and the finals looking to kind of stopped down on Griffin in this game to you really feel like if it goes down 202 from a griffin side not this again might be a thorn in their minds rather than competing earnestly for the victory here level ones for now much more of a 5.2 is coming out from the side of IG understandably just wanted to stop that from being vertical jungling if possible and allow the kale as even a laning phase as you can get don't mention Spalding up and we can see you now is ever goes to the various Lane klepto Caleb there klepto LeBlanc press the attack is a little bit less common on sorry I'm flaking what type is named there we go but will be fun to watch all the same question this game is In My Head Jason runs a kale should be priority line for the Chaser least have a lot more that even though like you mentioned that there is a Counterpoint pain to Wellness performance and also bought things and no list at level two hits level to look at any time at 4 open Otisco toppin dunk down on the shy and get the flash down early for that is what you had a story that first spray it happened right there lens both cubes and all those ones and the size truck down text me to of the crossing potions tax already bottomland kind of walking back and forth waiting for the agent to happen just going to go in for snacks right now. You can see how the eventual LeBlanc. Plays often before she gets pain to the back with me and let a very big CT condo would make life easy their balance much down there. Cool. Try the second ago I think for the most part the galio matchup against LeBlanc just looks to neutralize the block which is why I really like rookies kleptomancy because he says okay if you're going to neutralize me at least I'm going to get rich off of it and then kind of Hit the two items PowerPoint we're out then look to Rome I think that's going to be rookie strategy here so let's track the CSM Isola lanes because we know it was very favorable for the shine game 1 and rookie has been a. leaner throughout the group stage would look to try and dominate in this game otherwise chovy will neutralize leave the lane and try and pull off jarvin galio combos on other parts of them are very unlikely to teleport LeBlanc any Killzone galio might meet here and then has the information advantage does stay away from the sweeper so no outline Spa deadening still around Jovi not yet back to the late he's hoping the Tarzan uses cooldowns and actually where to see if I can easily comes over to buy for a root plants real Cuban doll and has to run away the re-engage available in a few seconds. Going to go for the more kills with a Scuttle and the kill go to Griffin know how much he loved and from that easily and I think just an odd play buy IG right there they didn't have Midland priority they didn't really have bought Lane priority but clearly someone said hey help me with Scuttle crab let's go for it and Griffin was just way faster than that but I think it was said they didn't see me we can watch them though Viper available wearing the key land this land as we can see in fact double defensive summon a spouse tattoo heal barrier being brought back not going to play football tonight apparently isn't here is that box side play, Toby hit the Taunton youth jacket I was going down and getting the flak early was what ended up winning that fight for Griffin knowing the jackula was a level 3 flash with Kaiser kind of allow them to very easily pick their target different music Joy Division albums made to the fact that it's he'll on lens and the barrier on viper really front of the keeping him alive against the assassination of potential of stay a little longer adults out of the novelist you want to point out how bad top winds going for the shy well played by sword that's a good time as well but sword with 8:15 c s Forester lyrics to this is a great return to form of the Griffin talk later have to again point out the electrocute Chase yep instead of a phase Rush Jays so definitely going for stronger trays in lieu of a little bit of safety and potentially late-game chase down damage will be better early on Tulane as he's been able to get good Pokemon on the shy don't have a lot of tools is kale to deal with Chase and the other game transformer all the abilities and the inferior jungle to be too as well be hounding problem solvers himself out of the scenario he's in my kiss end up being a pal family just fix it this point is definitely counts when coupling many to beaches as far as when people arrive to the power of the ultimate to be able to negate the other team's burst and then still fight back I've seen a lot of Hales me down 15cs early and then would have to be absolutely that's what the oldest set up for a bit then you start being swayed by he'll bury about land galio ultimate you have to be really on point with cooldowns here but on paper here is where he's taken some damage open the kaito away does jumping that's pretty old for it as well low health bars red Sprite and funny damage there from Tarzan yeah that's going to really help out she'll be in this Lane especially at this level six point with no teleport rookies going to be completely out of corrupting potion is chobe is full so at this point rookie can't very safely farm kleptomancy and it will give chovy the ability to Roman influence other lane access multiple fires Web Tales trying to deal with J Smith Lane is also going the way of Galileo temporarily and that's the perfect time to walk down onto the infernal Drake that controls ever since to kill on Jackie love when they should be uncontested two games in a row. Maryland parental great stuff they are certainly looking pretty solid here only the last game of the details but the lanes work good enough to go give us to add IG this time around the lanes are great you got the most of them was well Buster Drake was everything else has a great really gave her Griffin and it's on Griffin to actually continue to accelerate this because they are up against double kleptomancy still awake and Nicole Hiser so I G have very clearly said that they're just going to wait a little bit and hope the Griffin can't punish them too hard upon us down here but usually walked away from lens is fine after shock as well on this ra, Dulce Guardian sometimes the champion right to go to support your back going to come around feel and Tanaka for the charms going to get the armored him or let himself and on topside Spotify award but level 6 on both the jungle and the Top Value heading over there that's the big one trophy could match this and then decide to not fight yeah one of the few Champion to can help his paw plane from mid just going invisible is enough to stop me from doing anyting ning isn't even willing to stick around for the control were killed it took a lot of time for LeBlanc to push in the minion waves to understood that given the amount of time required for the right set-up unlikely to pick up a kill himself bottom Lane Griffin cracking open the source of gold but it is still available after the play very decisive Lane gay coming through from bucks I think it's another lead on to the Kaisers kind of crown jewel of this ID, and those are the types of plays we saw against Griffin in their second or for Griffin in their second round robin just incredibly clean play scene in top side ueno play as possible Bots I'd get gold on to your carry now it's just a matter how clean can they stay cuz as we song game 1 IG can still bring these games back with any big Play optimystique Owl as you know why you think of a white flag and that's another reason that suddenly and there's only two Tower update available but side that happier to go for Target Dives yeah cuz they know that I'd be the first thought is a half step back not a half step forward and set the cold by the word a certain Casey to start doran's blade he died with 500 gold yet I can either go long sort of AFK for Allure going to call have more region in my life better laning item in Elsa could buy put this dive just so good knock off into knock up and doesn't look like the flash was necessarily up all those sometimes it can be unreliable few will definitely have it for the next one well played
