thank you very much. Welcome to the battle arena game 1 of the quarter-finals is ready to go I Am David free the most inspirational fellow that I know I appreciate that very much is a good liar game 1 Astros Red Sox they means they must have to ban Silas is everyone does to your sister has dropped away from us well I think a lot of them is also looking at for a thrash band little bit of a throwback to Apollo and hospital last spring I'll be surprised if there's not even a hover in this game has been buffed up so heavily she's much more powerful in the bottom Lane actual place to Championor is it bring a little bit of exercise in a national event yeah that's what I could do the job right after top 10 right nowRussia smiling I love it and it looks like they are pretty good in the Jarvan because you can dodge the EQ fairly effectively as long as driving doesn't have a brunch place coming out of funeral fog of work the pride that you kind of like that match up and look at it really hover on a h boxes well so a lot of curly aggression as possible hear a truck generally a top laner overall but has a pretty good number of pause the bathtub to looking Frontline for the squad is got brown alongside so they can t fight with this they could buy them pretty well also they're not already taken so back line because that Kindred so let's do it TSN wants to do it for the second round of Banff already looking like a pretty decent team fight set up for a box with a couple of the delays there a chalk to revive Kindred ultimate going down but talking aboutthe main revive character of the game billion picked up for Buicks in or the Oggi's billion players yeah and even though you're know you as a place camping of a split game number 3 on zillion now for future experiments for 3rd Base we all wins does a CSM did they split the band Oasis top laners to make sure that those matchups feels pretty good one more to put to remember hearing High earlier and the countdown think the edge of a former vs TSM want to put him to the test to test it out in this series you know to the extremes Jake de Venta along with tack room for the Top Lane at top way in heck room has gained a lot of popularity and does not haveBerry Mini 4 matchup especially is good and a Truck specific licorice bring that one out last year at world so smart like a fox band the way though of course you'd be broken boy played on stage know it could be a possibility but then goes back with most play Tamil hits 7th as real game of the split more than double any other champion and there are lots of the balance that most people would rather play but it's been still on Comfort ye kind of me interesting here because even though during his time in North America people have been leaning on him for playing so much Azrael I really like one of those other most played Champions along with galio is Calista that combination is insane to me as your Deputy going to take a little bit longer to have a similar impact here and TSM are going to be a little bit safer with that big in 1/4 c r a 9.6 double tier will not be the build for the azreal but seems this time in luden's Echo or ruined King thordan it's not a problem at the hawk. Around out there line of their it will come through for Apollo out of his bookspictures always there is definitely a strong, going hard. Addicted with Joey and what will probably be at least a lady varice here for her I'll follow you definitely go both ways that the on hit build built extremely effective fresh every other side don't think of a truck stop laying around in power in that splitfoot something of the kind and whatever you see a Jack if you have early jungle fracture like that is going to be so much of setting up for later in the game explode on the pressure going to be interesting to hear rush I think is always a very confident player he's always going to feel very good about himself very first LCS playoff and heAuntie fm-84 expectations behind them so I are on a kidney if you can step up here and everything specifically ALCS playoff this is also Broken Blade first even though he has made the playoffs. What time is the L running this one now coaches shaking hands and DSM the guy get through Echo Fox got his age rock you got some good jungle pressure to rush too much to squat as well this is the test at the fox in a four-game winning streak including beating number 1 and 2 but tsm's only lost one gameTSM have gone eleven and one since Acadian created the meme about house with that their wrath will be but echobox did the one thing that TSM could not thus with they took down a cloud 9 to start off their four-game winning streak heading into play off both teams very prepared for this extra pressure and even those people are saying TSN are the favored team current form is what matters plant it is going to be a real thing we saw that a bit with Viper yesterday that lady still didn't come through with the wind is can be a very close match up here we've seen Phoenix really step up before he has been jerking people at times but we know the pedigree is TSM players and Sven years they've done so much with their careersand I'll see what the early game looks like he's been hoping for some free cleft lip go up not going to find it but I like the attempt you're always worth fishing around early game with Ezreal especially calves Ward protecting you on the topside pixel brush to be afraid of is of course prom very good level one but nobody going to group up here so no action just yet we have a door and she likes you for a follow looks like he's expected to get very little help down there he's playing for very expensive opener and the bottling pulled him to come through easily than the rest. There was rushing to get that without a problem and similar bottling full of a CSM side and I will see you where there jungles go as time moves on if I can fuck them to the 212 klepto gold Chacos going to move in a straight line that was too much for him get this correctly is betting on the bottom side for his Kindred first marks pain right here for the Scuttle read into frogs should be a pretty quickly or hear up past the bottom Lane no Ward was put down by the DSM to go by the way to see if there is a possible early is it from a level to read book Kindred but I was talking to be the case then the Mark has spawned on the top side so we'll see if the Katy can actually get there quick enough to feel it away or fresh just goes in a straight cuddle over to Scuttle try and take that again what we talked about here with injured in the Darvin especially early if David does not have a big Vision Advantage it's definitely super dangerous for the Darvin. Topside River there's two words put down at level one by the Equifax quad and probably can't fight yeah they know that this has been harassed as well it should be easy for Rush head over how does not have pushing Lanes to help them for a possible all in on the Kindred and it's very very dangerous should be picked up pretty easily as you can see broken plate on the Jacks going with rest of really pushing that laying in but he's going to have some vision of rush to know that you cannot further extend your soul has got the minion waving us very nice spot right in front of the which might cause broken play the drop some CSC are due to caution to watch you saw a rush try to keep that fell off the ski with a backwards he gets an octopus gets out of range and you can see that was coordinated with his jungler some communication just on screen right there for you broken play calling Acadian hey just passed by real quick so I can go try and push this in it doesn't get all the way in and fully reset though here so solo still has to wave in a very nice spot a broken plate does have to worry Kendra can make very creative Game Pass you can cue over back of Baron pichai and go all the way around so they're definitely still is the pathway and try and finish that wave should push back shouldn't be my teacher for the Jacks will see is that plays out though he's going to have to wait a couple of a waves doing every 30 seconds that you wait there for that to happen very very antsy enough but now that quickly is coming through Acadian do is on the bottom side and broken bow to be back under his Troy this game very close and Goldust Maldives right now Deco Fox quad to call that out 6 in that midlane + 6 / in the jungle as well as a pretty positive thing and right now it's been an equal trade a resource on the bottom side as we move closer close to the site stump mechanic in the farmer Leon and getting that First Market Lee positive on their side meanwhile everything calm on the bottom side there everybody just farming up as far as the klepto Sachs there's Bend Scott one slice I could go that I saw every single one does count when trying to find it your first year don't want to get your first back without a pretty big purchase you can go all the way to Pier plus beans if you are able to get a decent amount in Lane teleport is available and he had to been really harassed at all Brooker played trying to get a closer walk back up and won't miss too much Farms you want to point out you mentioned some of the spells in the bottom line it is PP for has been a cleanse for Apollo to deal with Shenanigans outside of galios Contour a double bomb out of the means that lay control to be easier for the Azrael side once again still able to get that backwards - 2q knock up to get out of the study don't play that match up pretty well and now holds pretty close here first ITP spent back in the middle as give you the same pretty recently been taken down goes more here looking for good for those who have pushing bottom Lane that you allowed to get that Mark before the arrival of driving or any sort of Lane support hear Rush definitely set up to have a very strong game near on the Kindred still level four for acadians Garvin and they don't have any Vision in on the dragons we actually called smoothie as you can see on the mini-map there to go Ward together and make sure that there's going to be no sneak on the dragon early on here because at Ocean Drake will have a very very big impact early on in the game pretty well not able to dodge the bomb don't sing a blow for him but not Midland Magic still Advantage Sports Phoenix in Russia that he can invade baby looks towards these chickens can you find some CS level five on Acadian now and that's not going to be a trade for the blast blanket Pops I might continue Farm analog the tension continuing to build here playoffs very very important for both teams TSM trying to have a combat gear from last year their worst year ever in this one there are two suckers Creek help or closed back down for Sven and he did get that big person if they were talking about the musketeer that's the best feeling first TV usage for the slain definitely is what you want chicken on Apollo's build me while it is cut list we is going for the standard on hit build with Todd Frontline there's not a gigantic tanks Galileo by being unloaded support won't be that much help in Jackson doesn't quite build backpack either but still have to assess the damages against Philip hornigold the freckled Fox overalls with stealing continues on and Phoenix heading down towards this out of an OP gets the oranges and might look for a guy and again at the scaling does continue here and we look at how do you say you can't pop zits for going to try and operate the TSM composition on the Jacks to be isolated whereas echo-fox one of you puff and make use of their folk damage there with the Zoey and of the Barrett right now because as soon as I even saw him down there you spell Acadian heading out of the base to the topside there was no intent for dsny how was that that dragon flame
