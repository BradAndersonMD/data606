dignitas keep themselves cold or hot diggity hot in this one against The Undefeated class now it's time to find out Gabby welcome again to the battle arena Cloud by looking at an undefeated run throughout the first 6 weeks of the 2020 season so far tickets Austin just one game behind that third place. It was love to be able to beat the tee to break that undefeated 349 and also would be a big win for them in the standings because we have so many things that are so close you really do need to going to scrape and Claw for every single win that you can get I would say as far as thieves that have a shot of taking down Cloud9 I do think that having someone like booty that gives dignitas chance at it right is this guy who can go crazy in the game who can take over a game and is willing to play extremely risky and we talked about it on the desk there talkin about the coins with the detective thing and it's another way of saying they're willing to take big risks sometime then kept don't always pan out but if it does maybe that's what you think then father appropriate what you are on paper the weaker team I think that is the way you find your upset win in the meantime though improve improve improve you can't quench have a game that's not how you do how you go far in a season know I think they're actually quite targeted yes we saw you know we know we can probably see some Robo support at some point soon in all that foot overall do they feel pretty targeted Briggs & Beyond Olaf uni known as the great Rumble player don't have it says his fans think of the instant I would love to see things and give give me a foot fit give me a true hard counter Pick 4 Lane that you can kind of dominated try to have an Avenue to play through because one of the big struggles that you have been having against about 9:30. Is that cloud 9 has just been winning every way and then the truck was a cool where do I go what do I do and they're also could have been like becomes very difficult and yeah this could be a Lucian Tapas could be just a standard more bottling play moving towards that but why the top one who needs that I'm feeling it give me the champion packs it all week calling it now if this does or not you can blind it early with the intention of flopping around right if a frog and Johnson and Tony are all comfortable playing it there is going to be somewhere that is going to work out for top Wainwright licorice respect the fact that hey maybe I'm landing in solution I have to fix something that can actually match up well against it then we got picked a really strong match of into it then maybe give me something else yet if I'm sick of toxic jungle here right I leave all three lanes open as a possibility come and get it at second band face and then you pick one okuu you slightly remove the options of possibility of a butt it can still get all threat did you grab channel to take the least amount of Pickens progress there and now Cloud 9 says okay well I mean to be done now right as a tooth for so long he's got every Champion I mean to pay to play a d Lisa serious about it so Hospital in their bed right now if it's like they give us insight into where they believe the pick will be going right if we see them Banning out more top laners they made me think he's going elsewhere on the map but stop because if you double ban any of those lanes and they can just send the Lucia's there and say great you wasted your band so not assuming that it is going to be another that I think is quite strong currently yep if you don't think that Jonathan has actually selected lukanette is bothering her play the guitar playing at midlane bands I can't do everything at least back. So I'm assuming those are ones that are reasonable into him he also is just pretty safe in the most matchups because you have very good range to require a strong dose of the most played for Nikki had for the Wii games to Kiana everything else is only one play so I'm fitted Comfort it is safety regardless of what frog and wants to play mid lane Lucian or not these are solid band sofa camping band Out means it will be a miss you push down so I can push down a little bit here to and worried about the possibility of another a d solo laner because he at least has already locked-in they noted has has a chance to go towards that has more Frontline I think Tom is not to fill of Frontline or he's going to save things that would be easy Needham now KY or something someone is lineup so I will say if you want to play sideline you don't necessarily have to write if you're going to commit to split Bush we now know this is Lucia Soul unless it's going really crazy with pink sole you know you could have TK there more as the safety for the Jinx to be able to allow Jinx the wave clear play two aside Lane Tom Ken Chenault to that side lane to try to help take advantage of that and try to win the game through that I finally taking down towers and putting pressure on creating a big Advantage there so if that's the style you want to go for you don't necessarily need it for a minor but I do agree if it comes to v e v when you're looking over what I asked it already feels ways your text to Don unless they do you want to go to something like that Malachi was only enough I think it's actually a pretty good batch of rocks then he is a very strong tanks I need anything like Victor pretty quickly here because jinxed is not be waived through a tkr you pick when you're just okay Lucian go once you on the side light must see you admit she is always said that it's Barrel unless I fruit is perfect every time that you could knock him in instead so if it's silver crate you know who should all day I can find for that kind of roller skates not for but it's unsafe and that's the dangerous of a rock based on about gun control at utilizing the wall as well as the Nvidia ultimate try to force-feed awkward position 459 but as far as a straight-up engage as far as you would expect the Cloud 9 has a much more simple composition of blabber with the Harding a follow-up from brahmas whales eat rocks in a couple of strong fat liners there is no Brom against the MSO fairly easy Lair Game of Ultimate overtop dignitas needs to get violated and just needs to get early-game advantages you have the least you have the Lucian to clear Target cure will be a frost and feels like what a lot of the game is going to be centered around and didn't toss at that was enough of the side lane advantage that's going to be diffident as they have later on won't matter one of those two lanes and after seeing a ticket on said okay it's popping and Divya is in let's see how well the match of plays out no one has really come close to beating Cloud Nine all year long, I'm sure it is surprising licorice is bringing top most Play 4 Lane you can pretty much be a lot of players are are really not players at practice at all with Ignite stop playing because they feel like hey you're never going to see it's never going to have a place in competitive because it is so all in your lane early one bad gang One battery call and all the sudden the person with tell for it just has a Monumental experience in Golden Vantage so hoody must play well in the early game bring must defend and from what games from blabber or the game plan is going to be out the window and the Top Lane I haven't seen the team pins where they do nothing big night but I'm sure they're saying it Out Loud by real quick on the sidelines. Pajama Sam Hui think I'd of dignitas this is quite the spicy to ask my friend any thoughts on this one yeah we have a lot of comfort pics obviously tonight's a very good team and we just want to be comfortable on the roof to make sure that we can get the setup that we walk and make sure that we are confident in those situations we definitely tried it outside since we can always has priority usually doesn't have like the best TP place in solution just wants to push in the whole game so it's something that was tried out a little bit and hopefully it pays off thank you guys for the cast I think that's an interesting point and an illusion definitely when you take help words. About the seclusion TV flag but it's about consistency for the actual 131 the time's right because you think one bad trade you can't believe in trunk logo and you don't die and you don't have teleport all the sudden you're losing all those ways that you're sure that you're losing all the experience and that can be enough to turn a match up around but if he is winning it is going to give him much earlier kill pressure is going to indicate a lot of the killing that eat rocks has depended upon in any potential all in with his ultimate so I'm very excited to see me pull this off this is the kind of pic I was going for right now if you're expected to get smashes 500 doing to everyone hey take a risky pic look for something that can maybe be the difference in winning the game so far and it has been denying licorice as you made it fixed also as a surprise to nobody both Rent-A-Center bottom size that they can get the whole three and then be on the top side of the map to affect this matchup 1 to 10 theater the game top side is he at least has made her way to the top jungle and dragons have done this as well as also about the halfway point as well right now but maybe definitely a long time favorite the man to check out the rooms here for me also he is actually going into the manifold band an absolute Focus so yeah also took instead of Triumph he's taking extra friends of mine in the ALCS you almost always see people take over heels on that ruined here this is very heavily itemizing towards man out what this tells me is when he's not going for an Essence Reaver build I'm expecting split it ruined King into Black Cleaver and more of this kind of early in focus and just depending upon the corrupting potion manaflow band and the stacks that you can get from friends of mine to be enough Mana from Death Valley all the camps were gone in deep Weber is back in the bottom side of the map boards just be still for that but it is going to leave Top Lane pretty safe and isolated exactly what he wants more information Univision so this is this is because money is actually not going to be called licorice did go back to base got a cloth armor as well as the refillable so this is where you know who he now has made the choice to try to freeze a Wave Rider group it and have it push towards him which is going to put Liquors in a dangerous position I think that is why we see Greg up here on the map they want this pushing Lane that Greek and then attacked licorice in and try to at least at the teleport out or get some summer is out to punish him that's because if they don't do that and liquor stable to hang around he still has his help work to one more bass no for another early item and maybe you've made it through that most dangerous match up and can no longer really be punished and see if course right now the $300 difference in Lane is expected for the farm difference nice W get the cannon that's pretty crucial that has to drop the casters for now 51 West Point down in the river that's pretty expectable from who needs I'd he has not gotten space to put his own Ward down right now in Brick so he was topside it's a kind of got missed he only had sleeper so great couldn't help word that starts with right now there is no vision to know if blaviken south side and they're not likely to try to go for any sort of early. Over onto who need their knowing that if we were to show up move you pretty soon so you know any likely once he pushes out he will then go in and look to Concord it up but I'll licorice willing to take a dip sit here and if this is not a match up where you have to feel like you need to go exactly even or or anything like that as far as the farm goes you can be okay being down in a 15:20 CS if you are against it at night Lucian and you can just keep it even at that point throughout the game the way I feel now push down towards Liquors inside of us as well bring a board to sleep in that brush how to push him out of range a little bit. The important part it's Greg I don't need the paper that part and it's okay I respect me okay so now who he is Dick's they could actually try to dive this with the culling if you can actually walk down Liquors there is potential they are but they don't know where bladder is so they're not going to actually look for it and whatever mean while I was just doing the dragon to your ocean conveniently for licorice will be incredible in this one the one where you are expecting to get bullied having that additional regen is going to make it much more comfortable and definitely moves the needle of no surprise here is the bottom line lead is going to miss Fortune Lane absolutely get stronger later than big Shirley on unless you are a add row CC like what's prank drinks and do some stuff to put on the Choppers if your top 10 you are probably going to. Yeah but thankfully for them there's a divorce yet or Johnson pickups though and if he will be even or ahead you take a Teleport versus if he loves been do they have had parties they've been able to get those preferential faces off but it was us far Cloud9 holding drawing in this early game and things have been able to find any attempted game with their Elite not being able to do really blow open the game through Top Lane or something like that either it's not that loosen need to win by this point but you know what it is concerning a bit if the game face Lucas over handed Easley defrost no skill the missed out of an app what would happen if there was no chase
