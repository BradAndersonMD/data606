with those teams that are to be at the top like this I'm going to see if we can make it happen in Valentine's Day card made from plant indoor growing sunflowers so you know the mother nature things still happen for me I will never be able to afford a house while he just ignored by the White House polarized Sorakayeah that mean Viper obviously known for his ribbon is has some incredible for me on its rocket much more love than alabanzas days people just do not like you play against it snowing shampoos that fills a similar role but I do feel that it is a Wonder playing that and it doesn't have the same sort of cross map in fact some of the reasons that maybe we haven't seen come out just yetwe have the first Misfortune definitely in this patch and if that's true for quite a while or has steadily risen in popularity I think it's actually a real early pick overall. As well as it has been in the most amount of later it is because one of the drinks of the champion but also I would not expect power of evil at the player to take us you almost always is playing the late game scaling damaged carry type Champions down straight away from that very often in his career doesn't mean I cannot go to him we talked to Yorkton play it but how he would be expecting just play more of that kind of control beach towel because that feels like his bread and butter and that is where he has had success for your game and Hills get 800 ECM you know that'll probably end up being a woodengetting away from them to do a whole lot here I'm sure that they get a more aggressive jungler credible gauge in a really good setup talk about the Broncos and passive there but it's Valley Oaks with the roof could do a graviton for the alternate route to mop lock him down for some big hit it hard hitting and take you out so I didn't want to see some of that targeted I would not be surprised to see Greg at Target it out I was going to say if I would like to pick up pick up the Olaf and that is kind of jungle fuss UV combo that we have been seeing until we get some of the stuff along lineshas not really been shown the info Play exciting absolutely no but I'm sure there is a Civic Champion that pee wee has in mind I think he is as well that they drop off that was in my head and I was like let's get first dibs on Jungle or mid and syndra can come through on this so we can be a little bit dangerous if we are going to love walk and it's also just a champion that fights jungle that is very good for any type of lease in a really powerful jungle canteen to come in and really focus there are we do now let's get some sleep outside but it's not as though they can't be focusing their efforts around mid life crisisso we will get to find out what is mid or jungle play in the mid lane if this is Bell cause that I am expecting you to be jungle Pantheon which does have your not not the kind of same speed of clearing like an old law for Leah for Pantheon either way that's incredibly good to be 2 combo de panteon with a pointy fix done except for that size mixture of This Blink and that was actually is a kill laid a griffin totally play with in life with it if it is something that can work really really well who is going to play which party has both those can Jungle Book this leaks in the forest and pour it inis there is no spots coming through will be at the Thalia for Buicks in alongside Starbucks Pantheon but either way send me Global Mobility here coming out from the jungle to be to a CSM I expect him to play for priority deadline and then take that and go elsewhere look towards the sidelines utilizing Pantheon all at the same time as the Tule all just cutting them off and that is going to be a really exciting Duo to Tri Pantheon jungle to start back for a couple of times trying to help kiwi would do is ruins wrong and lose benefocus but it is in the middle and physical damage jungle and top very exciting what are the draft conclude Pearson towards leaves them inspecting big things out of him but I think even bigger things out of Dar toques Pantheon with two good length again forI really do think so much of the game will come down to the play around midnight because it's Thalia does not have a push against interest I cannot go elsewhere on the map and his dad is where I just going to be both jungle it hovering around that is laying looking to establish vision control trying to help get priority for them than later so then take that bit later and utilize AccuWeather dive toppling. I bought land looks with acts of these vulnerable Debian like perhaps EMF5007 block west of going to do battle he's not a chance at tying second place in terms of winds up to 5 is where they sit right now in a mortal and we'll see if they can make that one happened the game has begun and we will see how much start off in the jungle on TSN can do with the pantheon pick up Ian has if I stay for a dart aqueous do you can't down when you see that the more and more of the Champions is not just feel deep Toledo WAP with you kind of feel like you know is going jungle is is giving them a bit of a different look in draft which is always going to give you an edgehere Wego always need to start to square off and looks like no no aggressive invade so far we do rarely see them so they worth pointing out double cleanse on the side of flyquest really respecting the combo there from Dyrdek as well as Bjergsen you know if you do actually eat that full combo it is definitely going to be a hundred as you're you're going to get really low the xq damaged coming through from the pantheon was he is probably enough to kill you off so how are we going playing Phase Rush does lead me to believe he's probably going for the Super Soaker that builds is becoming really really popular on Sandra especially alongside the phase rush you have the ability that is pretty unique to the champagne to actually passed while moving slowing down your phone and speeding up with the phase Russian can be put offdon't feel like going to walk away now Spotify this week because I don't believe they knew exactly to get going offensively or they put down to say hey if he's inventing a blue indeed they are that should be in that with the info Centrelink ago his right cheek when it blew yeah so we should be able to answer that and what this is TSM doing is just kind of splitting the back right now they're looking play down towards that bottom side well we did talk to me intro different leave anything that really wants play heavily towards outside this is signifying is my tickets what happened are going to keep running Jefferson Chevelle some space and it's only some poke but it's not a health are leads to the flag was Jungle and it's only can't for a camp Augusta actually love this from santorin the problem with it is that he probably is going to get three bus but I do think that this is such an interesting look almost always in professional play when someone makes them move to actually split mat if this ends rated and that's a handshake if he will takedifferent felt like he could actually go and challenge our dogs to catch him out and while they don't actually get the kill he did pull him out of the Jungle he did get the advantage so we'll see where he can take it from here but yeah it is going to be dark very likely getting at 3 bus start and it means other pantheons not going to take any time until he recalls to help me not going to be there on that champion it looks like Midland will finally pushed out to you we fight and 17 of a possible night alright they want to split the app and play to work spots I this is also denying some of that right because if we're actually making control of his multiple pants on that bought side he can still play around and try to disrupt the game plan that is coming through from garlic Jarred garlic is actually going to face after taking his truck so both of us are available he could look to do something like red to blue and then look up for MIT I'm looking for this one now is it supposed to be walking back away from Pua from Tarlac has taken the recalled heading towards the top 7 how to get his own blue as you mentioned through something was likely and is loosen up and stops in Turin all right, nothing special know OK bit of a surprise he's not going straight to his red but I think if you're bored and you know that went down to his boss Thai jungle you were expecting that that has gone right you are thinking then my Dockside okay the more vulnerable buff debuff is more likely to be attacked is it closed so he's just actually going essentially blue to blue and then fall back towards that read if you want to end your bath and actually look who attacked or that bottom side then having a longer duration on that Red Bluff take Ian Moore close to where you're looking to get a junk food makes sense though games and and back and forth between these two jungler DeLeon end result is it feels like it's a head for dry dock right now actually as I look over on his for everything else but the first recall actual money-wise he stopped by a couple hundred, crab and just kind of been in here so I can kill and then taking them more valuable Cactus patch obviously on his opponents buff right so they do have that 41 campus Bailey Bowlen Bluegrass play here they could be late but now I have to run again to the shieldlands acute how far is just so high and see if you're going to force turtleback remember turtle is not playing Hellboy he is playing Glenn so he's going to have to face the front as well as a flat comes out Turtles get that shield now is all the talk. I could flash that he has enough to kill every single time do they react in content or knows what's going to find a shield that you mean to stay alive at the very least still laying those beta Steven board now we can likely take away that brought here from his opponent once again I probably will be jumped on it be here by Viper but a really good wrong from Pearson he gets a flash of santor any delays the face extremely long from this White Spot Lane so they will lose at least one plate two likely lose most of it's not an entire way and you know they already put white behind off this yeah I think they already lost a full wave and the second one is crashing so just look at the Cs difference down there in that bottom Lane yeah I already opening up quite a big leak is nicely done to buy diapers again in about a broken plate but just try to help us back and forth pretty equal 1 overall news about a waiver for a man in the back of your drum over again worth it don't blame her the slightest It's just sad that it is fast and see why don't you look like while he got his boss has a dentist but sometimes most of the circumstances but the bot Lane off to a good start they're going to have a very preferential by here, able to give BF on his first by compared to the double long Surplus Foods in a turtle obviously not able to sail around long enough to collect that much gold is up and experience as we are seeing here you know he's about five and a half look at them for it. Even poured half over a full level down on Friday 6 with garlic at 6 to have that double semi Global ultimate that you can look to really try to get aggressive with your look at this without Hills at 800 Gould Lisa TSM early jungling has gotten them about a complete almost like I can make you feel more like 3 but the roads looking pretty good as well go ahead and so really good start for them the question is sort of in the Middle lake in Choctaw boys and girls games out but she wasn't even working DSM size what happened once again having to depart this bottom Lane to see if I'm on the way over yet again just going to run back if you don't back off there then you're probably just going to get dovin died right and if you do you're actually just eating the blue. So either way for TSM it is a smart move at the bit of a win-win for them over onto beer extended stay around will be going back to base now it is a lot of Bullseye Pockets but New York City would have to deal with a blue box and they will have their own rule of timer in there for defense to go through it more of a dive thought I'd take a black man to get away so it's like I'm knows they are safe but it's the 14 million difference down there it's BS or longsword it it's really rough and that's the bottom as well for getting some good traits are most active and I think that they're early moves or Superior and they are looking pretty good it's still not a monument to leave right it is going to be. I can Pierce in really looking to cash in and get them kills you and things to do in these earlier stages of the
