meanwhile similar things for for inspire doing a lot of set up jungle jungle for the playoffs after they after they got their loss and absolutely dominated with a carry-on goes I think he's spots really nicely into the into the new meta and Larson started playing the akali even played the Lucian mid you super aggressive fix self and River are going to have very big shoes to fill coming back into the team into their spots as mid jungle with the opponents that they're now facing meanwhile, unified have been playing together since 2017 or 2016 forget which I would have down to have read it recently but they've been together for a long time and they were the best bottling in the PCF very end of play in stage 4 guardless well with him in the lineup they managed to take top in the group so so pretty impressive stuff Jungle Band Come With Us Part on p.m.Braves really heavily here then you know what the jungle switch up once again for PSG we're not going to see the jungle Echo anymore which they had so much success with in in flames and it probably going to be either the Kindred or the graves for them most likely it with this extra focus on juggling they're trying to pinch inspired act Lionel Benjamin. We'll see what comes out to see if unified and time and can get from the LEC they had so many years later with new teammates in the new lineup and see what can happen to this one Larson a player with a lot of eyes on for me if it's going to be a rogue when I'm looking a lot at jungle meds at in Spartan Larson was the most band Champion against them in playoffs yes he was nervous and I mean they like solution and then they picked it up and has been fantastic with it this does put more pressure on AP jungle do and when did Ali and Lily a band out you expect something like maybe the Evelyn comes through for inspired to come by in a little bit more effectively with a silver Lane Lucian there's a Grey's I was talking about for River I'm surprised they're one of his most successful and most played champions amber necklace might come through here for this one it is the most-played of a top laner Hanabi and it sucks I'm up for a lot of aggression down there if pork is born band you can't easily fit a tank and stack armor that you can do it but waiting to see you now listen to come through might go for the fighter matchup I do think directions favored in that battle of the Hoppers come through what does he actually wants to play go flex around as well so we'll keep our eyes on it they're PSG very heavily indexing in to attack damage thus far with jungle and top committing to it in 1/2 hour early on in there pics means are definitely going to have to get that ap44 tank for the mid lane there's the Evelyn are talking about that's really really easily paired with solution with a little Lily I didn't lie band pretty much the go to there so now maybe we'll see the support pick up or bottom line pick up can they get their hands on for on Summa it is when the siblings we were talking about this before the match came up free but the aggressive land for Hans, where he is either Calista or Draven and they try and play these kill Lanes on bottom side of the map I really like that look from Rogues and since they already showed the early Lucian Sela Lane for themselves this is going to be a a road that comes out hitting very quickly looking to dominate some Lane looking to try and snowball and so it's going to be the center picked up right away putting unified back of that when he played during the TCS playoffs right there but that was a style that came through at 1 and so a lane that can sleep sleep lay back and just survive could work very well against the power of the not callista in most cases usually boys to Winter land that doesn't happen you're doing okay. I think they're Road need to ban tanks as ear syndrome I think would be the two main AP carries for him and and his performance is going to be so critical gear as we kind of talked about so with the extra one here on round two I think it's easily do Google for themselves meanwhile PSG trying to find out some soft wave possibilities for Finn Finn has been singled out as being single greatest point of exploitation exactly 4 for possibly four teams so that's why you know PSU with the early Renekton fig they very clearly are calling out open other calling their shot they want and I'll be to be that carry topside that's that's what he has played at world before and we'll see if they can actually make it, good to see these teams I think building towards their strength again mid jungle a really really big deal here for Rogues on the PFG side Top Lane is where you're looking right especially when backed up by the Evelyn for sure in a question is what goes toppling forfend and turbinectomy I don't think it's Lucien I think it's going to be malphite yeah exactly what I wanted to say I love this week we're like we're calling you out are you going to try and fight me armor looks good here you got a triple McCarver there with Grey's redacted so topside is full attack damage malphite is an amazing pick for Finn and for the team composition that they are facing the compound that engage with the rakan as well so Road actually coming out of this one looking really pretty honestly and play of the summer split + never came out you have to believe you know the champion pretty well at this point in time but cool to see him a new or you know we found may be rediscovered with lineups are in Frontline still expecting to be the farming Champion down there for you to find that I will keep that asterisk up as a possibility and we'll see how these teams can go final comments come through for the coaches and wrote I think expectations are on that they can turn around for the LEC mad lion had a rough road during play and you can't help but feel some of that weight on your shoulders then okay we will pick up where they left off do or a square road we can take this one down they won the LED summer split regular season those players first time in Ashley have to leave Got What It Takes and here they made a wave in playing with their substitute players and so everybody is looking at Tankian River coming back into the team now that they've made it to the group stage they're returning to the squad and they need to prove that they still have it and I think they may is going to be an exciting battle down here and I want to see how well these two teams can play in a lot of eyes were on skin as a weekly can you be a problem but is no legal right it's Armour Staffing on mouth white and I want to give credit to Road for scouting a lot of talent here top jungle in mid pretty much all. They're LEC debuts on road the talent scouting Bay put them in a Larson play two games Almost Doesn't Count that team barely even played this is Rogue putting it together from the Polish don't worry we're going to bring you back in let's play some LEC LEC regular season 3 first team qualify for World Cup 2022 for I believe they are and I do like how they took their lakes in playoffs they took the losses and they learn from them and like we are talking about they didn't use those strategies to their own benefits and we're seeing them once again they got the Lucian so let's see what they had to prove with it Larson and inspired the players I want to watch I want to see domination Sports crushed if inspired Larson can put on that same performance here and you heard it from the second best mother in led by text play run the world don't worry Larson right behind you then you've been playing an LEP for a year-and-a-half two years like this is an impressive start to his career is now who's going up on the world stage that we are running pretty soon we're not just going to free Apple about but but I want to see how well the rest of it can convert hunts, obviously a great player we saw him back on the Misfits run a while back he was really good down there is Bates they took SKT 250 eventually made it all the way to the world final that year and & Vander backup in as well I think I ate him he's been around for so very long and then I like to see him back in the station I like that. Everybody there if I gotta everybody gets their moments and now we're on the summoner's rift vs Jeep Allen do they deserve their moment and I want to talk about how to be in the top side this guy always a carry top player this is what I want to see him on you know he made his name with yasso way back in the day but here would concur Renekton they do have the difficulties of going double A D top and jungle into the malphite but you can still focused on that side and try and Punishment try and work off of that strong-side go for the invade take control of the blue puppet Ryan to the guy who broke some of those options during your recall switch it out for offside for Finn you don't need to put your own words down because it's just useless to put effort down there but it does mean that Finn cannot get his own Vision to be at the winds and mercies of how to be in River if they ever do want to gain come down there a hail of blades for callista very much more Lane Focus the only other real alternative would be lethal Tempo look at the Subaru Subaru long can't work this out you got to be kidding me the early that is incredible road with the level 1 planning here they just wait patiently in the side brush hair vendors work on comes out get them after the flash knock up secured Firenze was fear is right out of them here's the hook though answering back inside you know what we get for that first Blood little bit of chunk of HP and Hendricks just get a hit right back up with the posting of course equipment power and honestly it's for PSG in the fact that there is no flash on the rakan but as the lovely coming through the got to push on the way if you got a back off when you sent us and Nautilus right now is doing over there River getting up to the top side and you finish the bottom side of a very similar situation is a squadron so now do you want a fully cleared out your blue quadrant cuz you don't want to spend time out towards topside you don't even look at him until he's level six you know his duty there on the malphite is two lights away. I'm so he does not get into a bad Lane State just keep up in his desk vs. Renekton don't take any crazy trades versus them make use of your passes Shield wait for it to come back up before you go for those risky or CS to try and get the last it's that you're looking for here to ask a little bit on that malphite and look for your levels that open all of the playmaking for rogue to occur on the bottom and midlane they've got yes no flash on rakan but everyone is actually one of the well-known for the die first in everything going to the Jungle playing has roamed up twice for Midland gang the bottom line Bank in the way more than either jungler in this game it feels good for inspired to be able to do a full clear on Evelyn just having his bottom line Bluff the game for himself because all of his Gantz goes in this kalexis bottom Scuttle crab right there and we'll look into the future here because yes this is Hans, and Van Der different multiple gang Sports Midland burning tanks flash punishing him again without the flash returning to bottom and picking up their CS but once they actually settle on by Evelyn is one of the best junglers to go get one of these lanes because you can pull the trigger as Evelyn walk up into the lane you allow work on to jump to you as soon as work on jumps to you you start handling your charm then work on jumps from you honestly opponents that you are hovering by invisible to get the knock of charm combo and then you get a full CC duration charge charm of your own it's inescapable once you get that CC lockdown not anybody that gets locked into an even a semi Tanki Champion like a support Nautilus can get a hundred percent to zero with that and send Evelyn with the invisibility provides that extra jump for work on it makes it a lot easier to pull off VAP coming through right now 900 gold lead to Road. The most money on Larson because you are showing at a cyst multiple ways though it's only a couple hundred gold but obviously for tank doesn't get anything he has almost no notice for a building at the truck and Potions are steel that's not expecting rain
