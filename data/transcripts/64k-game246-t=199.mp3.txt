I-4 in past years so I want to see them getting back to what they learn in Spring and we have to go to keep an eye out on the game the game how it gave Ian and Greg are performing because these guys are competing for the starting spot. Definitely something to watch for absolutely of course Greg had a very good game last Sunday against the LG Acadias back in so far as soon as I get Saturday Sunday foot on expecting road to play tomorrow for example and we'll see when they nailed that one down we are the champions like that you mention irelia you meet vandaway in the TSM side flyquest dropping stolinas off the list do want to point out we seen a lot of middling a truck over the last couple of days here as well so that's Affleck's pic in and of itself and a very strong man with that being targeted Dust Bar in a three of the key ones off the table to the bar and I still rise as well as a collie but these are convinced that have received the first and Anime VR going to be as high priority coming into this week I call you and Chase the big still in as I got into this weekenda little bit and 1.0 banter flag with the 40s and get first dibs on this one and waiting to see what comes through we had I believe a pair of Rise games out of filter himself rather than enter to win a pretty good while doing so do at the bottom and comes in as Szechuan e as both you've been away a jongleur to you than the first picture being taken off the table here by to get them to their is the opportunity to take away is tarek I do think Derek's you can function quite well independently of this Donut for you still could go for something like at Eric acronym for us to pick some flights which I think is very powerful in and of itself and then still play at an apartment is very very interesting because this time last year or to say when I stand alone but you can't play Sona stand alone so far we've seen so many even without these kind of crazy as well as the stand aloneshe fits with almost anything go ahead take the turkey won't matter if you do and I like that Evolution that we talked about that's very very interesting to see that adaptation and that their opinion, has weighed on that matter I do also think the fact that you be has been so prevalent as far as presents at least it wasn't very well in scrubs and I think it was kind of showing some of the teams that hay and generous support in these kind of base before it can actually be quite effective and one of my concerns or you're not going to able to have that is that the economy is in the big game where you have this tank support paycheck and brushes and putting down words and that was always why a lot of people said if it's like so no couldn't function in in in the right and now that you'll be has had a lot of success working Sona independently more often it is kind of interesting to see if we can find more of a shift towards that even Bob Ross painting of Zyra last week and it is doing the Googlechange of matter is that moves around cuz I do agree I think it's a whole Suite of Champions aren't thinking right now. Probably could but you mentioned tarek and Akron together but is CSM who gets the least Jungle which is a nightstand out for me they say Okay Jayce is most important role in her everything laptop and now Lux is picked up and Azar to support luck with Aftershock but we can leave seen her mid as well a little bit Yeah you say it's only picked mid kind of has that counter Fizz do is when we've been seeing it recently I do also suspect that it is going to be bought land but a very different route and tarek and that in Akron with Linda I thought they could have gone for now they haven't You're simply giving DSM that quarterback I wish they used it a few theology last week they had these three pics plus I believe Jake themselves as well as billion deadline for Puritan and that was very effective for them this time for strategy is pretty Telegraph from flyby so this is Dad looking to attack the top side of the map and there was an interview last week a cue from contractyou would ask about AP junglers in and he was talking about he thinks at least can be very effective only one paired with one or two Champions Jays or an act that they have the jcf this is someone that can bully out the top line that can set up for Dives where the elite really will excel so your GSM is going to have to pick a very I was thinking a self-sustaining top layer of pain play defensively because I only want to play around the territory can use that Dazzle Bastian, absolutely and of course we'll see what does computer finish off this Ross where we have still be so willing to TSM yet to pick flyquest get old Smith final counterpick Year's Eve bands are nearly done Camille dropped off the bench super dropped as well as you can see several Watling bands have come through trying to Amite wildturtle Champion what he said you know Caitlin got some bust recently she's looking pretty good now is bring this one out dad and then Caitlin + Luxe in a function similarly to have work on it and Caitlin does if you ever able to hit a binder you can trap right out of that no Post 6 the birthis going to be bringing with that ultimate that final spark is quite powerful to certainly there is the volume potential there if you can be on point with those bindings and Pike into the Top Lane thank you ji 2 evil to bring it out into the world we can see it mid as well to fill winter almost certainly regardless I'm expecting top into Jason well if you want to go to Camp someone I think you could probably get rid of camping bike reasonably well and not even a blind tickets on Mid laner I really don't think it said right here koreana probably you know I think that goes back and be pretty effective rise also does work here you know that says give you a bit of a flex pipe potentially with with a pike and the rise but we are expecting certainly Pike to go into the Jace arises going to allow them to play in those islands thensee how effective the counterpick is going to be here for Evan Jays goes back in the mid lane keeping the ribbon or the question is just because there is a potential to steal but hike into that Jade if that's what they want to go for but this is very aggressive you're from flyquest it feels so much about the early game you need to dominate with this Elise you need to have bullying Lanes here and they're really going to try to ramp up the Patriots vs Viper alongside the lease this is definitely going to be at Pike is going to stay up there I am excited for what those two players can is a very physical heavy team you're lying on Jungle Italy sand support locks for your magic damage so if that's going to be I'm really excited to see if they can pull this one off really think he needs dominates yearly game if you allow this CFM Squad to get to those later they just we saw what they wanted to do and we thought against the LG very easy to ask you diving onto a champion like luck similar to do what they did I get the ball frost on his Ira if you really can abused does low Mobility bait supports with hecarim in combination with that tarek so I have to get a lot of work done your league everybody dies, 1 + 1 0 and 2 the big storm we had coming into summer split was who could crack the top three of lap splits Team Liquid TSM and Cloud 9 black Westworld once I got the knob it was a slow start for them and then Torrance ederle packet wasn't going their way but now there are others against one of these top three teams they're up against TSM team a deadlock Immortal in a week when is a good time to strike for flyquest certainly isn't something that already kind of noticing here is it actually coin Sona the first time I've seen this does make quite a bit of stance against such an effective Lane like the Caitlin and the West because you're simply not going to have winning trades with him often times very early if you ever do get bound up you are going to actually even just died to a trap was whining combo so this is going to allow them to play quite possibly and still maintain a high level of income so you know it is damaged will be down a bit but he's going to complete that fight song faster and then be able to start his farming faster as a result those are going to be more Mana Regen to dispel these would have given to a he is on heel duty all Lane long to keep through the alive little bit better at that as well and we are going to see what happened to these little ones as it is. The roster Camp as BSN leeches the red stuff for a ktnv Duo fly right over the line at the store this morning not deal with a two-on-two too early on is not that one down and he's going to try to bypass the brink of War Camp Hill be spotted doing so as soon as early levels you can see turtle and JJ posturing very aggressively they want to be able to threaten and onto this Lane and rubbery smoothie that has to be taken the farm before has been actually completed question of that is usually a how they are going to play it out that is very very very difficult for him to actually get done here again to locked in a Caitlin and not only can they actually no bully out that to me they're very effective at knocking down parrot place so that is certainly another part of their plan here if they do win that to be too very heavily you can start to move them around the map hike is certainly not someone who can cut a fold in that want me to type scenario either very low on the wave clear so that they are could mean a lot of her place going down across the map and right now she care cuz I've been allowed to get Farm plates for CVS on Stone and four smoothie kind of waiting for a farm to get his weight around as these battles keep going back and forth to book The Odyssey does with Aflac Westside the healing of what these I'm going to do to not die in this one has then walks up grab that little bit extra golden 7c ff14 support is a fairly slow start here now I am curious if if this Lane is ends up being so I just for me directly and then taking you know whenever the coins do come in. The place I like they're going to have not seen points on a myself as the farm roll but I know they didn't Envision I've been seeing you this way you can actually Farm you know without having it turned off like this. These two would be so is that might just be the eyes you hear this will be a much lower income Eric then if you know certainly an adaptation on the tragedy which I think makes sense in this is a dive you cannot really pull off because of a deer so they're going to have to back off but already getting some good ship down on the spirit Acadian right place right time though so just wait this guy but you are making their own yeah, 19211 e Lake Nona is the primary from a member as far as I can tell so cool new look here on this one but it's still an early trip taken down it was about to pass directly to be there in he did and stayed alive on this one but and this is still a few on to lie to myself and you just got hard Buddha Lane off of that but even with this strategy you can see it's been already sent back to base hopefully for him he has enough for that coin upgrade he does have teleport turtle is playing TV so we'll be trying to really keep this Temple up in this bottom line and I said when we go back out of the map is Ben bringing his first teleport and getting just the fairy charm Andre Philip ocean not the most exciting start also become an upgrade which ya zal thumbs up to me silently and his freak don't miss that won the coin operated horse early gold income that is so much of what it is about this is a really smart at atation based on the length are playing again I wonder in a situation this just makes sense actually just go Aries and instead of klepto as well right because for the similar similar thought process if you are not actually getting a lot of Autos off in lane at the klepto gold is going to be very low you're not going to be like actually stealing a lot of things I will have to go to tractor out the game how much he's really able to get through back by Coon because if he's not going to get tonight I do tend to think Gary would probably just be more effective I actually grew that Keystone tries to hear one thing I do want to point out with this coin plus Farm Sona gold basically identical to Wild recite the ten CS difference the gold is within 12 here so this is definitely working out he is on parody completely and eventually that will be a late but eventual combine there has to go for a little bit of damage there has been placed in the house so attacked back for the JJ has Steve Deluxe tries to crawl out through the spell T cells have more gold interior otherwise do fairly equal quick check in on the top Lane a small farm in my mind is actually winning in Siesta and will long term but this is been a fairly close one we want really hasn't made many moves you did go down to that bottom side of a Dancer by Katey and so not really any commitment to that besides that he's just been kind of power farming here know he is up and experience over akkadian currently level 5 to level four but it is not the kind of explosive early game that I think you're really hoping for as wife West I do think that you were hoping by the time a chrome is 6 that's important is already killed a number of people are forced a lot of summers are or kind of breed is some sort of significant Advantage for his teeth and that certainly is not the case just yet and right now Central flying away hoping he finds heckerman rotation apparently is doesn't walk by another controller doesn't put down earlier listening pop the blast cone and now goes to fight this war Das the Red Bluff has spawned right now it's getting is taking the long way around level five. Both these players and is missing in a glimmer of early game the grass is coming to your house or at the Alise it's not to kill this is really nice and you can also see if you look at the mini map of this bottom side of the jungle look at all these wards that they do have in his whole area these four words around there for quite there trying to establish control in this area because water has the pushed in midline so that would allow you to then set up a situation where you can bring that for me and fought for potential 5 of that is what they were kind of showing in early levels they have been able to pull it off. Seuss far but that is the kind of things that you do want to see I will say it is a bit surprising to me though that he has been playing war two words
