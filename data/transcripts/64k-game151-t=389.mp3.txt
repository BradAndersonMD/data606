counter logic gaming do battle I am free voicemail Kobe early here Lucian is going to find his way onto the list as well as super good flexible take right now that we haven't seen it actually drafted and played around that much if we can actually find some set action as well as the number one Harbor well I had been so much hey everybody would have to buy any more livestock forever or horses or whatever actually paid already has other couch doing up here I was groomed so maybe I will be dropping thehere and they can focus more on the stowaway that does go through I would always racing is defensive stats even if you get a difficult early Lane you're going to be such a big away from in Philly near The Chi-Lites yes I'm still hitting you bang is like the sea MS-13 in Vegas still in the DPM chart she has a top 5 player likes Vang BAC I think he's had a really rough time and na bangus playing very very well would you give a front-line He will carry you to victory Azalea's combination Jarvan very good at going for early game as we've already seen some players in the first week the second week I definitely had some over aggressive moves but if Elias also needs some defenses with him right places I have any don't feel any chances of any sort to Austin time we think either Tomcats or Brom drafted within the two most defensive support on Pinterest bad and they're actually not drafting Brom right now so it's going to have to be a more offensive look for the Cecilia and they're going to go for those killed Nautilus very high chance that it can go for the kill. Underwear work on dialing but slower sometimes it is more difficult to get off you're actually get good traits off on Nautilus you can go so quick and if you hit him with a W before you get to the audio out before he gets his golf you don't have aftershocks seniors I can actually jump out some good damage replace the evaporator coil and let me go through to the second phase and I like this band. Evil Geniuses vs Dean College gaming put kale for ruin in a previous that match epic good skills you can grab a close to winning the game where they were so far behind because the champion good band all the same and that means it's at Banfield Kendall jungle targeting here maybe the rexha gragas the most Providence Pro jugglers and then for the Top Lane band year for EG probably another range to match up for set things like kale and rides that can diffuse that early or really difficult to deal with today go with the mordekaiser actually split a while because he's death row every single game they've played so far just calling the fact that he's maybe doesn't have at least in the pool or not scary enough that they don't care about the Champions but it's played like that pic band Champion stop playing stop playing matchup Soraka should be able to farm Define versus debt so I do like this secondary pick up here are we talking about movies campus around but that's what the highest probability for stuff like that pretty early on as well you'll have to worry too much about that top side of mad because we had that big affected challenge is accepted but it's going to be going to be able to Pilot Elite OK and enter into Ariana's typically considered a favor Dustin threat match at that we have not seen great things out of town just yet this season was a highly prized Midland people thought he was arguably an upgrade over power people whom he replaced with TVs have a great year proud of having a horrible one I want to see that guy Step Up skills you can see if something out of their mid laner I can hope it gets funnier if you look at these team competitions the action should be from dlg all of the box. because you are never killing set painting for a Scirocco Lane so we got a pretty clear path I think you're so everything in this game or it happened towards the bottom triangle the map by the way up. Recognize that as well playing from their side and Spence can can also look to counter at least it's very well if you get there first you had a brush with which to start out for fighting back into the first game of a day what are they going to bring up cuz we have seen straka top couple times now my read us the rocket is that she's not incredibly team come for life right where you have carries the bottlemen already damage output tends to be at most, anyway rocket is generically just because every Champion has hell and you can heal every chance we have not made a champion that doesn't have health yet yet yet who knows you mean sometimes gets around that once but but but yeah it is purple and sometimes that can like just in general she's worth taking it almost everything composition and so you might be like the one that you are they trying to like make with the cycles of matter like she's as good as gold Champion I do like it when you have a good at least little bit of CC to work with to structure the team fights I feel like you really shines there why you can't with any team proposition it's very nice when it's rocket gets easy access and can stay right by the Carrie keep them up the entire time and a little bit of CC does structure your team fight for you but I completely agree with you definitely add a power level right now that's worth drafting in those are right and if you look at the inventory is done with the classic 3 Rejuvenation beads for the full to stay in and not to be able to whittle down this set at all that plus the passive plus the strong base stats for the Champions Kumo can actually take this harassment just focus on farming CS so basically top Wayne for me is literally just poking focusing on last test and Wave Control out here in the passive Yorkie that you can't multiply the past Health regenerate his own flat tire that stacked on top not that it's wrong to buy reduced because I feel basically five of Sword Lehigh exam going to ask for a second so you know just Invincible here and we'll take some autos and I'm kind of really feel good and that's the thing the lower that you get then your second part of your past and says kick in harder on your regenerate that much quicker but like we said focusing on the rest of the map because that's where the jugglers are going to play as expected Wiggly did start Red Seas going with a bottom ruin turn left I don't think I don't think it's going to be any big he farted on command prompt you knew he was top River did just do and usually after the enemy jungler shows like that and weekly is on your mini-map he was crowned actually hoping to the wrong side of the map guys want a hug besides your jugular is on away from the enemy but it's been scaring guests in there for an early killed in that Midland and that is going to go a long way at least now we're some early money is if you can actually affect bottom side of the map as well, bumps on Jarvis is showing eat ground could be Hobart okay so here here's a possible inside what crime was thinking there he was trying to force the Jarvan that is erroneous because they just stopped the Elise on topside like you were saying so he should be respecting the possibility has been scanned in there but that's what I would guess I would be his thinking there by positioning Puffs to the topside you want to force the zoo gay into Wiggly and it completely backfired yeah giving them a first-blood no flashes Lonoke described you as soon as I showed up o I have made an error and he is dead so he does at least hold onto his Summoner to look to find out what cancel is might be on soon as he's done on Craig's and then take the work there should be seen by spend spend those trigger words stealth very slowly so we saw him down he's waiting thin case me to Facebook this look I'm not distress you don't know I'm here and if you happen in going to wait around little bit we'll see if you come down later on push back up okay I'm not going to add you like she'll just focus on putting the wart in bottom died because when scaring they know just clear topside they just going to be the next area that he enters so they're trying to keep grass and keep tabs on the Elise from here on out instantly we saw a mid working down from zukie about 30 seconds ago that was in the top Lane brush because Darvin was mostly clear and bottom of his camp here does not have obvious tools to get away the press the movement speed by living space there and got them not any noctis to be had something walks away from Camp select going to be fairly difficult to affect the Top Lane and I think that time spent up in the top triangle in this game is fairly waste of time it's going to actually give you a genius this opportunity Dragon does the show Jarvan top side and yeah. Just walk your way out and playing for a well-written defending MVP MVP over on cloud nine get to take a break ECU for drivers go topside you have taken all of can't get to grab the slowest of the brakes and Mountain their bottle and dressed already great weird to know Ben is awesome and and there would have to do with it as well all right after dragon has been taken from the rip it's actually changes all the Dynamics for posting 6 minutes here before you start thinking about pushing out there waves are recalled off and do a lane swap to look at the Ridge Trail nextbigfuture objected so he would be nice to feel very good about picking up that dragon uncontested and as you can see you keep referring to this bottom Lane and the pushing that's going on from bang and Zanesville they retain control this minion wave this it looks like a 6in smoothie want to let them do that though and I got to cook pasta for this one will figure out what's going on with that one before too terribly long what are the meantime we got a decent start for Evil Genius year of course right and have got Baxter gank off the wrap look good a couple hundred gold off of this one actually is going pretty well for 6 a stye audience with your learning to onto pretty nicely which is so impressive stuff for them so you fellows can always try to take over and Crown you know just like that one ganking the you can talk assist you can call it trying to aggressively force a game yeah he was in what he used to teleport to get back to Midland so that's the reason why he didn't drop any CS despite dying it does bring up the conundrum of a Teleport difference in Midland now because you get done still have his for orianna orianna teleporting to another side of map is fairly low impact especially early stages of the game to expect it'll just be another teleport back the lane for him but doesn't mean that he should be able to keep up as well. On your screen the guy to get the action already early in this game with his Elise straight down the river honestly didn't take too much finagling for him to do that as we are talking about kind of the positioning there from Crown definitely gave him that opportunity and an EG very happy to get it but by no means is it going to cause a huge shift in this game yeah it's going to be it's going to eat you working for it they are head right now hope you don't moderate use really does matter it helps the set the Invincible cuz it'll just multiply all this after he has and he tends to build for Alley Brewery in the first place and small gold leave it on Spence Karen that means he's going to snowball his his early human game against are the matches going to get some more pills but I can reach you should be looking at where are their efforts going to be best placed to actually get them a better chance to win the game we've seen toppling gank from CLG even if you do get okay probably best Nair as you bring the set flash so you get a flash advantage in the Top Lane that probably doesn't move your needle towards a 18 victory for Soraka having flash advantage over a set in the top way very much at all that's why I really was hoping for some early at
