it's the primary assassin that Justin has used Not only was it well used bike apps but it was also a take away from Cloud 9 value their yard of the traffic to have Team switching sides of these bands look very much the same as last time to go and we'll go to Cloud Nine pans or fanatic or more triple band thrown at caps last possible flexfix there and that is a lot of respect from his Pulpit Victor corces there as a potential come to pick against a person has the first pick for guywhy won't be a quarterback from Flex take her the counter pink eye should say is there for Cloud 9 as well without words that happened with you and I want to do a lot of us grew the Cup champions are still available and we'll see what comes through all right what day does very well is mobility and Mobility has been incredibly important so far did tournament for Conway's on the last game where was there a head lightning quick and gauges and that made it very very easy for the answers to get fixing for suffice across the map so if they do get a lead this has been very big for Hellertown value st.joe here on the fanatic side and take that away from Sin Cara no visitation last game it wasn't that scary but it is still considered the best early-game Lumber in the professional see from Lucien I want to get that from Portland after taking now I would also think about taking me the other side of the match of their Spence Terence least then we haven't seen it that much but it has been a pic that he has also been very good on and does have those options as far as the extra ability to try and work away from the sin and the HR selling at Toppenish ergot for themselves and only played at once here for Whipple and a bandit more than half of their game so not a champion Steely Dan ever willing to play or all that practice price of this is actually a fairly spaced curious what other kind of bow has is Swain is still up for example if I'm very curious what he will play here he also Jungle by to ask for Lisa and I would also love to see it's listening but it is going to be the greatest Victory to use in a quarter-final against the freak after you have for 59 to Victoria Banana Foster great flocking to the Jungle usually packed like that yesterday at the cooldown reduction Grace also scaling but here we go early game very very scary and use of the champion. We'll see if Anna could do the same and the Korean Chinese Jason really good we'll see what the damage or Belgian I believe Jace is like your phonetic way to go through this one doubt from Reckless it's still too cuz I have been so far for the combination of a way to see what else comes through another draft the same deal because they need an area of the map that isn't a losing laying it doesn't have to scale-up you cannot have all scaling you seen this tournament you just get absolutely run over in the early game somewhere that is pushing Lane to try and play off of so you don't lose all of this will check this early on is going and Jason against that a truck if you didn't work yesterday just so heavily favored to Jay's no surprise here for fanatic with severe they can still race with the last pic with those types of matchup you kind of need a jongleur that brings crowd control if you want to try and kill the alleviate some of that pressure and that is not the case here so once again fanatic looking pretty strong as far as the opening of their draft for two at 59 will respond to with the bottom Lane well another one I do know it's Binky plays a lot of Victor when he does play other lane when you have to play with my display the champion of swapping is around 2 but it could be damaging his ear is certainly the Emperor of that is kept in the mid lane Wendy early game but the coaches long rain makes him a very safe and then he gets to his team Friday station to items and becomes a Power House of Night and I think Elaine face looks very good with them has the range advantage over a Chach you can harass them then you dropped into the brush up on top side to drop the minion aggro as you're also can outrange but Sondra the only thing is he has to worry about you see all Limbs and it looks like he's taking cleanse there to try and get out of this game but in the bottom lane from C9 Victor coming in from sneaky Leona from Victor purse with the engage from the Leona and his exterior to her she will get to the Target and if you waste your Shield actor gets done and you're going to get Frost it down very quickly play music on stream but now at World in the semi-finals the Victor Leona Lane for the bottom will this be the surprise card that cloud 9 need to get back into the series and will it be the comeback that North American fans and 59 and cells are hoping for in this one fanatic handling themselves drop game 1 and b e d g G2 in the quarterfinals drop game 1 2 orange and still won that series as well this lights Howell not close those games where is from now on the summoner's rift I am definitely going to have my eyes on Brockton looking for some aggressive passive passing here from the gym. How to maybe even split the top side of the map in France secure some area for with O to work with whippo is a very aggressive top laner always looking for trades and wants to be able to get abused it said see my right I agree with you will be look at the bottom line from C9 and they speak to pick the grabbit early we saw last game with the plane but they didn't move it to that topside I want to see the connection with Liliana here to kill pressure that going to have with a night as well and Azazel it's a lot early game damage just from the support of long and already there are differences here you can see with Stinky's room choice you say Canary for trading in the bottom side of the map not the kleptomancy that we see for the top side trying to form up there that's definitely makes a lot of sense he also has domination usually I can't see the domination runes but usually you'll get Taste of blood types of ravenous Hunter 4 and that is for sustained in late is Jensen's lissandra he was really good at getting away from those games before we'll see the attempt once again here is licorice and Whipple get to their Lanes in the Bellator fights as well stop the bottom side the end up with a truck vs. Jace Lane could be a difference between different I've seen a lot of Western gate for your struggle in the past Backpage snowball game I can prove everyone wrong and say that he has extra practice is enough to Heart win this match because it was a good laying for him and he not done so well in that what you want it if I can go anywhere close to that I'm pretty sure I can really show Liquors what's up and in game one that was true maybe some jungle help with the bot laners fight will do the game looks like in the topping matches well yeah I was going to stay put. Definitely has the right mentality for it as far as being very aggressive pushing in licorice zoning him off the minion wave beer and trying to use his shot glasses and an extra bit of damage liquor still looking for maybe the Long Key on minions arranged so still that is advantageous to The Fanatic topside and the way will slowly push for clicker she will gain exp not zone out of this but advantages to go to Fanatics I'd bring hard CC like a lot of Douglas licorice can actually set it up and there is a possibility I don't sing at the super likely bottom side though it's raining very heavily so that might be the area a juggler see Gravity Force intrusive as a pre level 3 fight right there when 3 comes through the fight happen to stop by to help actually that people might lose but whatever the setup is from Zazzle makassar really twins around nicely and I like that Houston is what you're trying to do was Reckless of this household knew that was going to happen at your house out of bricks so always mine games in the bottom line when you got a bit of damage that was basically it but the gates and licorice is trying its best you just match far he's slightly down Spurs game showing in space up there was there's so many minions it for the trait is trying to buy licorice time to get some last hits there in front of people in the mid lane again exchanged going pretty heavily in favor of the damage for here at ever Matic what goes to licorice yes I can pretty solid there in that top 5 we know that rocks that is nearby and can come through if he's needed alright so first race we got the two liquids that you wind up if they were supposed to go on Manitou had it before you will go back and used TP to lay most likely you won't admit it be hot out of it the last pick was Sandra like long-range hope this is so effective if you want to threaten you properly and that's why I sent request an attack on you was here but that's also why you see they teleport to lasondra and Jensen has been forced out already and that's the reason that why you staying even in CS right now but has already used his first teleport back to Lane after he was forced out there by the harassment of his ears long-range I want to see you soon and maybe go for a fly in the ointment side do enforce the cleanse out early from Cops then try again at 6 maybe while how far is still low and has Kim have an itchy trigger finger to make sure we can stay safe Urban farming Peak to Warsaw flight from sense Karen we're kind of waiting for Brookside to pull the trigger first because I going to send our love to just say okay don't thank them for like 10 minutes 45 seconds grandson was going so far okay if match pretty similar on the recalls there and The Division coming out for rocks outside going to be spotted out now my son as well as recalling so spent trying to get there in time but does a good job killing the Scuttle crab so quickly but don't know he's there and that was with both of bottom land and the Midland having Rolex founded influenza saved to be enough by itself to running back to the lake with already in the jungle wouldn't need a few 2/3 or not but the moment they still showed up he knew okay you can. Last year to prune an early advantage in the jungle matchup and that could be important. Whipple's Mater from just permit pushing his top scientists will need help as we can see right away at at Sun Circle in the game overall as a position 100 goalie for finocchiaro liberal-leaning says most fat being done in the top five eleven CS difference that explains a showing his experience on this Victor pick even though not too much in the bottom side of the map as you said it was really important that Reckless positions far away from hylissang for they get the max distance outside of the gravity field there to avoid that chain see that you were talking about earlier freak we will most likely see when they actually go for another or later but they try and get onto the Civil but she cannot dash out of the starting from Victor Damone when she get to see cheetahs long as they told ya she has the advantage because you should quit animation and if it managed to do that breakfast will be standin played for quite a while and that's enough to kill him but for now he's playing very safe also doing presents for cloud nine is allowed Spence Karen to move in and take control of the river around Dragon actually do it but they don't have any Vision on the positioning of spend hours that there's no Seaport in this game and it's going to help ring around a possible dive or counter gank hear from the bottom line New Orleans it's still way to Blue Bell Stables sunroom up and help him as well and often. what's early on this Hartford to do a whole lot again to Victor and Leona so right now it's just a battle against the clock almost went but I didn't know if benchley they will get die if they will get you in a gang by ICP
