Stacy LG did Lewis or the opening set up so we'll see if this goes through as well as pics of bands have begun mordekaiser is dropped off a table course we'll see what they could do from the south Phoenix so far has not played a mage in the bottle by Dove Academy Misfortune was his debut game to just find a mate had like a 26 KDA on Zoe SO waiting again to Kumo Thorn that's fair Celtics Beltone cash off the table Rumble and a collie dropped off here Tuesday spent a long long long time on CLG what are the essential and Tuesday was on it he's back here in the line appear as well over BBQ Oliver's indologist Korea it was like he was dead the whole time through either way is that they're ready to go open Bandit. Going through who is CLG don't mind that one week we did a ski covers in our first game we really so sorry and I was like oh my goodness drive to your loved one out of Belio snot band better not band Phoenix X MF is he go to volunteer I mean and also both of these teams did play mat for the game so can't completely disagree with it so far and that's definitely going to be one of those very strong many faces and I mean if it's not broke don't fix it and if trash work for them and game one they're doing it again here all right now it's back to see Oggi's this time around do this to you Vikram South got time to take down already has the least room self because that's what it's okay we'll grab a sport and I want to rush 2 aphelions betta I mean to be bad for the second fan face are you afraid of that do you want that to be you know that I can see if I can get down to tear I think they should do a fellow here but there is a champion pool things you'd be trying to consider you also always have to wonder what A team's goals are in a cat bite okay number one language game I mean I think Raven stood out late and asked if you could play forward as it looks like it's bblg getting away to the 202 after both teams just hard walking in there bot Lane jungle making us do the next day it's going to be completely dedicated to Solon band and I kind of get back to the what are you doing in Academy question cuz ultimately everyone's goal is to make else yet so like teams and players need to figure out the best way to do so is it by showing that you can be laying Domino's Draven or is it let me master all of these Metal Champion so if I get. I don't know right like it's going to depend on each player from this draft it looks like both you guys are staying with the NSA candreva tick with a cellular Center just being absent this is not an LCS game like we're not practicing that apartment that would never happen in LCS so I thought answering I actually wish we were seeing Santa Fe Leo's here but I like the Viper School of software it's like a what I can do three or four games that split and play aatrox in order to fresas chicken for a player on 3/4 blood Raven game to split the rest and then after I pick you up at 4:20 from Korea right does taking Imports lot you know that back if you can spray tan players got to got to feed heads and shoulders above you know what domestic fired because of the go down the water and put it like this is what I'll spell it for me to Monte Forest had that great so we came back on Friday and a Truck Yeah so that is now 3/5 of their day 1 composition lourlo Phoenix and oil are playing the same Champions it is impossible for them to Elite was taken away from that the Cadian played and the Zoe has been banned which is what the month W or to be honest to get away from the ball back over all very very good cleaner overall and with Concord not doing true damage you can generally Atlantic at that pretty well I was taken Tuesday around 2 BC or meet again seems unlikely but you never know I think or mid is actually pretty good I think you can wash a lot of Lady phases and and kind of go from there with potential Rome's in the same way that a nautilus regalio can be a good mid laner but it does not require a lot of things. To go running after the remaster that came in beginning of the year and don't get me wrong but he's actually very very strong Chaffetz do waist nearest weaker that doesn't mean he's over off but it's damn it is very high racer has a really high and he can actually blow people up Vikings going to hire his early-game Thor abilities fight fight fight low borello 13 + it doesn't kick in he's actually quite take he just hates that wife if you don't get one shot you can get to W Hills off that healing is up as well like if if you were taking up with survivors have to fight you are an absolute pop off the road back for Damonte is to just kind of fruit without a shadow of a doubt like you I like the pic I want to see you show up with cool stuff like Tuesday is is very journeyman Academy player here for about three more years of point and end against it for your voice mate just dial on this game right now that she answered that affect at least once in awhile play her hattefjall again like 25 into overall game on her so yeah I like that as well being Popoff things like to have baby be single stack roster in the seats are my provider for winning Academy foot and I want I want to see people alright the stage Academy game at the end of Sunday try and get a little bit of showcase for these guys to make their arguments for going into the LCS augment Phoenix doesn't seem it seems like a graphical thing I could have sworn I saw press the attack just making sure a conqueror and not not electrocute so so that it that it a little bit it's getting fixed will update you when it's real or you'll be able to tell Lauren seems unlike what's the most XP of these I might be curious yes that's okay that's true that's it for me Vixen comet irelia would you were aboard wordox Raven at least, it does things right hurry and of you and are all kind of spells you know what okay and then I'm going to fix it all right it's just it's a point-and-click yep shock button except that it's worth it conquerors really hard to stack firewood carrier is going to Safeway in Syracuse he said there's the first time since Mike there is the kill first one is in that blue bus goes to as big as well that's really bad for an Olaf to get that kind of Edge on you and you to be down Flash Blue gone where does Acadian go from here probably just kind of full. So don't jump if you could really see what she took her boots I can sing well I want I want to hear because you know right to go Red Bluff to Candy try to steal blue like do you make the calls I like instant recall take blue invade Raptor like right how much do you know I don't think progress can ever try and get blue with the thought of me being pushed like this so this is this is Acadian saying you're only ever get free camps may be okay yeah but yeah l'acadiane should run through get his flu and then go to read but because you showed mid he's leaving his own red expose acting really don't like that I think I'm supposed to go to space probably fortunate one more time as we were meeting about Ruth indicate if it's just up above easyflash follow our respective leftovers. all right well I get it back his own chicken so he did go and select was on topside guarantee no more steals my last to follow me to pay for the pole Academy what it means to be Acadia to on the jungle on Tuesday not instant flash Following over to maybe get the last hit gives Demonte more time to get more refills off it is a good start for Kaden's office and I'm pretty sure every scream ever they would say Chicco next like I've already called the speed ride like this this feels so catastrophic it's rather catastrophic I was completely you watching the Columbia when I mean Tuesday she want me to fight in a big meeting wave has become a little dangerous but he is playing towards the jungle right has the flash away Tuesday doesn't know exactly where he's going to be able to flash and then he had too much he's just going to be able to cycle axes all the way down after is red was stolen by at least who's lot of pain right there little bit have to look in to see what that was about play Cecile GT Davidson Windville playing not sure where but either way they're there at least you know calling in call into the meeting check into the server online to the best I can for all employees of course as well but I'm going to find you no 26 Yankees player dumplings actually + 3c yesterday's hits this week has been jungle that's a really got to talk with you. Phil is the player who bought the game looks like he is to see what he's trying to fix his monitor for something so hopefully it's not too long of a delay before you get back this one just as you were talking like wow what a catastrophic or the game can dignitas speed run this one you do never know right depending on one thing going wrong or the Bounty being lost by the Olaf it would be the display the dignitas wants to make an academy when they signed such a Powerhouse Academy roster I enjoyed by the way I'm sorry. I couldn't do it because I love every game reading player chat all of Phil's cooldown tracks are in all chat that's so when I get invaded and 50 seconds alsat 540 jungle flashback for the jungle flash but then he says he's like ship entering outside anything I know you spell cooldown you want a cracker for me when I give you the exact second that's actually you think that's intentional or cuz there is a level of mind game where you spam there flash timers to them right like you know how it was June B's proview during world like he has the most spam E flat out player in the world like he will max out chat all the time if he just did that to all chat actually be an advantage the other team would have to disable all chat because he was scroll there there I thought we can you disable all chat in custom games you can there's been proved use where they touch their own team pics just happened that's amazing so yeah you can do it the other way everybody eventually they'll know like oh yeah yeah I want the misinformation I'll check that's that's that's like the thing I'm not know about that when I was going through right now is dignitas to the way around but I like to say hey but now this is the way it's backed up on the side of the lane if there's a VIN and it's going to lose water park Gemini really fun
