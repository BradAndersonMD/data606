is it just that final step of closing out the game because actually mentioned they were in such fine position with an ocean soul in that last game and yet it slipped away but I'm looking at these veteran names like Asos vacation that they should be able to be a really smart players and I think you could have triggered a lot of their leg in victor e as to how they shot call the game but and their game against dignitas they almost we're trying to be to create how to win the game and they're trying to split push and they're trying to command bearing instead of just grouping Auntie fighting with their ocean. Hopefully I'm a bit more clarity today and they can actually see how to win the game the more they let it slip through their fingers the last time they played dignitas with a lead but they get one more crack addict see if they can move on baseball and Guardians 4th at 6 and final spot in the playoff picture we are going to let them roll to the first base bands before I hand it off to our casters for the call of the first game of the day Rumble looks like it'll be the sixth and final Banff alongside a couple Marksman and a mid laner there for dinnerso we're kind of playing the field at the moment of Elliot's being locked in immediately and that's my two casters take it away the deaths as I am freaked alongside the water and guess what Johnson already got one and only most played that's Champion by far it's a failure has his eighth Play We Are the Champion twice as many more than twice as many as every other AD carry that they have gone for and it really does show showed yesterday in the team fights did a ton of work in the late game good aggressive plays in there as well as Mortals probably wouldn't answer with Miss Fortune down here and I think it's worth spending a lot of time and Mortals built at their Peak ac7658 gold lead with ocean soul and threw it all away by failing to take any kind of a decent fight they could type is the pantheon The Mortals played against him he was piloting at at one does have the point-and-click CC to set up I actually love Pantheon in the jungle right now this bite the low solo queue win rate because it does open up so many options for you with power diving having the directional Immunity on your Shield as well as setting up other forms of CC on your team still having this Champion already locked in for dig I could look for you know hiregy PSI Cassiopeia or something to really carry a late game team fight because I can't connect to set her up and protect her early, but together we're going to weigh the first or the second thing to pick to see women there does come through as going to wait for a top laner most likely as well I felt waiting around for the final phases of bands back to getting dropped off away from Houdini Mordecai's think we'll go unpicked here in this one I think they are maybe off that I finally won but honestly 173 mordekaiser victory for noon yesterday top different County game of this was something else skills then deaths Apollo was dead that gay make only had one and it was it was a threat let's be real that was thrown into playoffs instead either of these teams has 220 to make it into the Posies they must win this game and then an hour from ven play Golden Gardens wind that game as well that will be the fight with a stick and final 8th seeded team which means nothing for you in Spring split as a yeah and it looking at the team's out already talked to her already looking at Immortals hard engage they got such a whiny and said some of the best part and gave you can have a champion for champion in the game right now so they're trying to figure out what sort of Carrie they can actually get for frog that is not going to go down yet RZR 1000 with the Leona this is hard hard dive comp and they've got Misfortune coming over the top so Immortals like the endless s kind of touch. I'm going for one of those giant AOE five-on-five hard engage HR come through the top 5 lb the answer to set here for Hootie and is now for a couple bands already through so he wants to play with probably a week I mean for a dig site but I think it would work for a mortal side as well instead they're going to do with the Poke for a little bit more pick potential here you know they already have long-range PC with such Lonnie and Leona if you hit someone with a sleepy trouble bubble that is easily followed up by either of those two tanks in the front line so yeah the cleanses I think will be necessary for as many calories as they could actually take them on which will right now the Frog and & Johnson no real surprise pics coming out though no new Champions entering the arena much more of the standard okay so hard engaged a lot of ways to move in and close out game. Through the goal for them it was the inability to do so that deprive them of an automatic playoff spot already so nobody's over Correction Facility Who has had problems closing out games in a conventional way a lot of their wins have been through a Bruisin back doors and TP plays of whatnot so we'll see if a very obvious team fight if you can work for them meme on dignitas it's a lot of comfort who is a truck is good frog Hands by far the most played as the Oriana Johnson's by far most played as the fellas Do It Center to fight go very well for them of course we are going take a five-minute competitive Integrity break we'll be right back after that with the games of stick around hello everyone and welcome back to the show game is about ready to begin and it is a battle for a chance at the sixth and final playoff spot dignitas the Blues by Immortals on the red the loser is just the 8th Place team you beat the LGBT liquid and your spring split is done we'll see you in summer if you win this game though you've faced golden Guardians in about an hour's time. Is the battle or third game of the day that battle will be the fight for the last playoff spot will see you in lower bracket and we'll see how far you can go we are out of the rift and it's going to be an exciting one as we got to figure out who can take this one home things happened so they tweeted out themselves once again a game on a fellow's for Johnson I mean he has been popping off of the champion yes it's been nerfed in 10.6 I don't think everything is a playlist but certainly a mortal thing didn't can they love first pick in it so that is something to watch for absolutely looking at a fairly standard spread of Champions so far overall do you want to plan on going to Mortals have gone for a very very heavy engage draft the set the stage Juanita Leona all really good at going forward this is a team that feel they have pulled a lot of interesting sort of comeback wins in late-game a conventional game endings have not been what's good for them they threw a heavy gold against the guitar just two days ago I can't even doing the very standard drop a recall grab a sweeper get out of the map in a blast don't start the Red Bluff looks like for him released from his bottom line Madewell Szechuan e and set by the way incredible jungle start at you always start. Sevani set has really good attack speeds you just keep stacking a permafrost getting a stun triggering it and stacking up against a very very very fast leash so I expect me to be low BMV Auto do owls kill it and you going to be said they have the pantheon just like getting an arguably less Autos less damage from the team in the league Dracula face by the white Leona has a really hard time do anything level one I would argue that it's easier to be a nautilus Johnson has the attack range lead here as well so definitely going to be powerful modeling for over 2 minutes now that yet Zillow cast for now while we are you if you was Kobe a he will be back pretty soon into this game and then you'll know in the meantime test my shots like it's maybe 2006 or something back when you almost never actually do o cast online games really throws me back to the Warcraft 3 days so we can hopefully do pretty well here curly mid-length looking pretty standard here is frog in almost always an Immaculate sir yes sir I do want to point out the egg before it's a pretty good in his own right here was walking back and forth but not really really really powerful you have the range leave if you if you don't Dodge the key with an extra cute Plus Auto attack it's that the million damage that point is going to Apollo going to have to try to run away thankfully does have similar heel plus the sorcerer and everything else to just really get away from that one but that one's going to hurt and ice cake in the early game for a kitty inside from this down a little bit earlier on do want to point out that he is actually two camps ahead right now in an idiot attaching award to his location is now they would rather take the crugs
