to see how brandini does in the second game he got a lot of flack and his birthday but I thought it was fairly unjustified his team was running funnel he was playing get Nocturne plus a cross with a Zoe rolling up top call you and no helping and I don't think that's a fair test for him so I want to see how he does here I also really like that the fanatic coaching staff of thing it is not fair for Brock type of place to Leah cuz they was the last game of the way this one may be a bully a funnel here from Roxette okay well either by the dress continuing 8 trucks so far left up on the table haven't seen Institute play it just yet from what I'm looking at foot Force many more games be played at Force overtimepeople to play it in the fact that Renekton got slammed by it yes you can say play a difference as well but if people are not confident how to deal with it I think we're not going to be nothing but they dropped it may just become a Pure red side band has a very specific game plan to start so it's not a huge surprise him with a loss of normal first place like a person not feeling of being taken away in Italy as well and he issecrets are one of the best pick forecast in tickets well but there is a possibility of looking for something know we saw actually caps running are the cast in into that as an answer that is an option think there are so many draft picks even a talent that is potentially available here if they want to go for it in living things is Levi going to be the recipient of a funnel once more available if you wants to do it again next to him you don't need the broom can also just be a standard Grace big as we see it leave I definitely a very confident Camille player here to again it does not have to be a funnel I kenges standard aggressive jungle Pick 4 Levi who can get a lot of work done on these type of Champions viable still in phonetics turn to pick up a couple of Champions we know that is though he is not enough pain that I'm going to be playing Just directly in the Middle Lane unlikely funnels and if they want to go on site at 3:10 to go for next daySwain is also left open in this draft pick trade pick 4 for Whipple down a different tank drunk or so if you have a super wanted things very strong base from the first part of the driveway, looking very very powerful each other we can talk into this way now or never move into the pike hook and then I suppose a lot of displacement there a quite a powerful bot Lane and something to Hellsing is extremely comfortable onknock knock I'm very comfortable Champion penalties one last pic look like a band phase and maybe look to the mid laner to handle Zoe or were you in the middle a mouth harp pretty strong also Galley to do it to it was gathered Camilla great dive take pics and always look at Health skills to look at lck but in the West trailer with having some bad March 12th as well but combination like you have to follow up on that engage in what are the pics going to be here for Cody temper brandini I do think that they're going to need still in a lot of consistent damage and this is looking much more like a hundred the more traditional style of game plan you can very easily because he sent here on a marksman how you doing being there for the follow-up in the kids at the DPSAmazing Spider Ohio still available for the potential Camille select a little bit if you can find a good match up there if you want to but I do it you can also just trade them on the phone other tank top flavor so if I get off and play Orange it's a fantastic day for them when they run is Bruce accounts would you need engage but I definitely a fairly stable match up a list the Bentley in the early stages look for other types of cameras if you want to actually go for a soda fasterbut it still is Martin's open I wonder if one of these will leave Top Lane to last to let that Camille still be flexible as unlike it would happen if she is I mean I certainly think it could make sense to give Brandy need that last pic to give them comfort and let their trying to have no more of a marks and pick this day really feel the need to hide that they want to go to craft a composition around does get even that much better. He's been so they had we're going to get the order of the Buddha is good against you or the rebels good against you are and so they're going to be the ones who have even more reliable and Gage but still very low damage so I could Mark sembrat NY post and commensalism play the plane in the bottom leglouder going to walk in the bottomlands first-time tense the next tank in the lineup to go alongside this plane and where is really good at it tank so I think it would be a very sparked matchup I will see if they have a comfort to actually play this I mean this is a tremendous amount of CC on this unit was of hundreds he's definitely a strong crawling things like coffee or from fanatic which is really kind of their preferred play style ish and then another option definitely not as good as a lame-ass everything into the orange but I certainly does allowed to have one more flexibility make Riley's on bought the Alistar and then you can ask your friend, pick the state in Pacific League full frantini but they might have been something there but generally is EPS on the side of fanatic a lot of like poking quick firstCody son that I really think this pic makes sense I mean yes there is a lot of picture on the side of fanatic U have the The Flash top is Billy a bubble trouble fanakapan everything from this is wanting as well and whatsoever you can pull the am at right in the middle of the fight that MF is going to die very quickly so I think it's still much 400 East about them being once we're proactive they must be gigs a fight and started off on there looking at the Big 5 men's moms that are typically enter a v computer like you can get a standard style buildwe'll have to see if they're going to go for that style of a field I know it seems, counterintuitive but the essence Reaver a free bus go to call it actually last long enough that you can full Tamil your I'm at fault then get your auto then have the sm-3 block come out and I have seen it be pretty effective I also was with running out math why is that new infinite I think better for Misfortune than it was before Chris damage was very bad stat for Ultimate Foot Street Evanston vs. very good one bright Hypocrites Kaling you know as far as damage conversion that very high but they can't ignore damage is pretty great so we'll see what the NFL's going to be Cody Sun I think can be safe in the back when he was really looks like Levi though on a high damage 5e expected here in the lineup for under these we are getting ourselves out of the rift and I think we need to see how he's being extremely proactive when you have poor and when you have Camille Galley all these are champions that when you hit Level six you want to be out of the map you want to be making place and constantly looking to be aggressivehere we go a tide score line the group stage 3 + 3 across these Regents fanatic there raining EU LCS Champion tendency for the finalists of the wipe our ranks are these the third best team in NHL the second best year in Europe and Today's Dentist in their lot of nothing else but just want to make sure they were mad at us tweeting from The Misfits account before and they are not at this tournament and that's a good feeling for anything. Here's a follow-up good damage but comes right back outvery calm play there from Levi making sure to not panic and actually hook shot early and I'm missing the hookshot would have been death or Flash either way he's going to get out it does kind of suck to start with the whole one but it's not actually that big of a deal you still can clear reasonably well with the hook shots and in some guys players you do actually see and going over to the rafters in fact we definitely a free okay if I like you're starting to be around to fixing something with it that's fine make it play in the land he was farting in bed earlier that should be no issues at all Brock them into the state of his might leave it in the past always been a lame boy get Squishy Target if you can land if she wants to them and if you do so much damage from today in case against thesepanettone armor level 1 of you still a major so what's the temperature to be pretty interesting to see. It's really about getting a bonus CD for your frock and you can have that bonus a d on your qpath roof on your ultimate in that can be very powerful and into the tree damage that combined with all the text messages because it's against the very cranky last three things costume ages and one of us actually build a bit more durability so as nice trading on a Brandy right here with this early on when I see orange I don't think man this is an insane like I need to carry you know you get on to him he just can't get away from a committal to go get hit by every single CCM to die but I was running 80 carriesI think he can do it pretty quickly in a my concern is less about his damage output in more about can he stay safe against all this dive I could come in here from thematic cuz I really think you practice swing passive you pulling in the center of the team and that's probably going to be lights out there for a weekend once they are stacked on top of them are really going to have to see how well he can position in and how well the rest of the hundred do you pronounce Szechuan he's actively looking for his claim this could be a die very early on and Roxas so durable full HP this could be first blood in 10 seconds from now very easy to set up here to with the hot flash. He can't join they know this 400 feet of his kind of durable and uniform his first item and it said you know it sexy little bit too risky Ruby crystal in the worker Beal is that is the biggest thing I think it's you know that Levi is not up here you hundred percent go for that dive and you can pull it off no with so I was leaving that off but you don't know where he lives and if you go inflat tops and Camille shows up that is probably a double kill 400 be so kind of playing it a little bit more State really good damn it just talked about before he's just a mate on this way and supposed to take a lot of damage combo I can't actually pick up a tuba to kill from the heart of Thieves here as a result if he's trying to grab something like a catalyst into an early Seekers and and try to play it a bit more defensively be probably coming in on east side adjust back for low for both teams youngest rocks in the brush leave I found a spot him out for this one hoping for a ant steals might pop on both sides and that's thanks to be late for our dear you had the bush Cass is going back to base so no no scent in Roscoe Rick actually risking fighting for that believe by now what does a jumper do you want to take that with your visitors at base is not too bad right there leave I have a single camper you again waiting around a bit and key keyless and no Smite on Levi's they know that they actually used on the previous Camp so fanatic is coming down here it's only two members different fanatic clinch first-round so long has not coming so as his is backing laying is sure you put on a 200 hp going to get a look at back of skull shots but pushed out in the bottom like how many fanatic lost it completely backfired, they're losing every single trade whatever happened to Whipple and then Rock say yes to read you trying to stay around and insult to injury he didn't even get this gives up his life again here so that it's just really okay so I was coming down capsules in midlane to meet later is here you can see Brandi if you don't even out why are you still here
