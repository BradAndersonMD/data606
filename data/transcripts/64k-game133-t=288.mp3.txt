been a lot of thinking of TSM and you can actually see it in their games on LCS in their specific they have had to physically very good early games especially behind our dock dogs have highest first what percentage has the highest average game time for a rear comparison when you think about them focusing a y on the early game and trying to throw ball golden tickets early game that split it was like 8,000 voltage on a minutes I think failed to close out on and that is something that is Dino going to be an albatross around their neck is you know they've got to figure out how to play those games out process in traditionally SS said that himself even a few days ago and he screams he talks about Team Liquid strength that's traditionally been in the five players being better individually than their opponents and feeling to team fighting later on winning the game that way which directly to craft a contract with the way that gives them has been losing so let's see if we cansome of the most notorious Kelly Biggs orange is off the table Affiliates off the table and you do you mean Super annoying yeah we're already getting first fix that for them though it is they want all the games have they lost every cent of game they lost their Ash game Twins were on damaged carries for double if it's still ended up being the Team Liquid doublelift carried you over the wind damage why send the roster this weekend and that means like yelling to learning a new style to win and that never worked and now they are not reliable if they have to undo Southwestall right let's get an attempt selectman veritime cash locked up very safe I like this combination especially know where it's one of those 80 carries that's kind of difficult with your positioning sensor power still gets out early Lane phase Springs SPC to the bottom side as well Jack to be very strong do a label see now it's at school and chords they want to go up against that we tend to see toppling plus pot Duo grab in the early rotations in camping select there's the MF great champ has overall and the blitzcrank hover I like but I think it's not what goes in a flight all right double down on that for is time change that most Champions you know what but can't win for winning the bet ya win all of my winnings from the ALCS game is actually more fun all-time stats because I looked at so many random pads preparation for the game show all of you this is going to be a lot of power you can also trundle pick into it is up right now so we'll see if TSM want to focus on Jungle pants as liquid still have to grab there's two of my favorites into it gets what's right or was I just mentioned no longer an option I really like Olaf into it when I went over my chemo talked about they don't want to play for pulling early game which is a lot of what that's about. Napoli run over sidhwani a lot of it is dueling an invading and playing a strong Lane since we traditionally think that's a good are going to go for more of a v e v setup for later in the game probably won't be the thickest get that probably won't have to wait to bet on it either broken plate options broken blade has been such a huge part of kids and cigarettes part of their flexibility in Champion Select Netflix so many different Champions to the top Wayne hymns are talking jurickson all Trading Co set born piano style Champion for themselves which is really been a big Advantage. CSM workers go to the jar from the old after this one will see exactly obrochta wants to play his beliefs sin is up notable in a lot of a shark with a deal might be concerned about it's kind of hard to bend Tomatoes black specks on toddlers back going to go with the general power that's left up for for solo pics since then you're going to have to reveal one right now Aurelia Aurelia assassination definitely has been used by TSM already I think I'll pull in here right you leave your keys and Pick 4 last movie really want play in or you're something yeah and flexible technically can still move it a good pick in December just don't see that matches very often but it should be savored exactly and favored in the sense that you're scaling right deer kill with the extra range earlier on huge Boon to The Landing and should be able to type the set very effectively now what are the problems with the shield that room is actually getting a decent vs lease in that game however they created action on that top side of map and kind of messed up the scale scaling part of its way from 59th and Dixie in the last game at Fort Jackson I'll Malachi is certainly a hover I'm not there are lots of really viable Top Lane tanks not named Dorn in this patch Alki malphite poppy set jungle cinderhulk is very good as well as realistic as they actually do you like triple what I like this so much he's orange playlist good morning likely yes no rush every game some Hall of Fame and named are Aquarius lyrics it going to continue I apply question get their win but looks like we're going to have a tree in the middle of a gar versus I love it especially with your people using spells so frequently and I will see some of that ridiculous dealing with make it up through the middle and it will be the new way for TSM broken played on the big hairy for them killing later on I love it I love it so much going to be very exciting there was a great fact line it is kale top in broken places that have an outstanding your Auntie has been so far doesn't get a lot of gang has very good fats, there is a very consistent player good csgo damage numbers and CSS innovating I see what all the fuss to text the first Malachi of the split in the LCS Travis capitis denied me. So far for the support there are vendors three Malachi's all year long if you count like the regional leagues and everything else I did he use the cat skin or the Malachi can we get a room for you that's what I like that for S&W after the attack it supposed to be out of it sdsm walk back out first lick nicely done play a sedimentary maokai picks so far worldwide competitive 223 were two days ago some of the regional leagues were playing do you have to build up there because I'm expecting him to just out tank Abyssal Sunfire like walking Zone play going tank build and probably expect to see something like a spirit visits built as well just to make the most out of that passive but it is it is always remember those days where you stack up a bunch of the saplings in a brush someone gets shot walking through. Now so it can't quit you that thing was not great and got mostly helps healing abilities but has very very quick attack frames like the dew point in the swing with the impact it's very early so I plan on jungleland surprised at even the level one attack speed that he has now tell Marcus one of the Champions. Lane take back in 2017 where was George came out they gave him a little toppling tank Nautilus 50% tax be so he's got like looking for a package to the game I was so surprised I thought they had done it so good for John like she's kind of clear as well all right we'll still see ascend it's you know he's getting some as far as I can be I like that summary. 5, is also getting some stuff basically they're doing the same right they are both numbers I believe there are both in Smirnoff that's nice I like that as of your students refuse to take any damn pit people see us right now top is pushed it back in their good punch not bad can you fix some degree of this I think dueling said early on doesn't happen even if they all had some range jeweled it's just a man if you have too much I mean Focus here 100% yeah for broken way it is all on farming it's all on trying to grab the last year we were stealing exactly with the door on shield with the passive healing there honestly it's better to use more of his Mana trying to control the wave Impacto has three and it got brought back as well there's a chase down a baby what timing 40 l HGTV her birthday party has to do with the waves going to freeze against him in a Flash the scale is such a big Target yeah this is a really really scary situation for Broken Blade that's why I look at your mini-map immediately they have Dar. Heading up to the top side because the wave is pushing away from kale he's got no flash you have to have your juggler around to make sure you can try and get that wave bounce officer it and continue to descale here for the couch and this is, but again it's going to have to wait from afar yeah I don't think. I wouldn't put you onto with a flashlight scale Who's down a level so have a look at it but that man that time he just got around the corner Roku but you get a seat at minion that he's failed over to impact at the melee on himself just never get this done one enemy on both sides and flashes right over to follow him unless we done right there as we look back at how the midline is going it's still equal to mid lane tankfarm doing just fine for the arson I really do enjoy the fact that he's taking more of a tank roll I know you know years past it was for like you're someone denied ever knows his award but he's got more supportive women Capri and it's been interesting to watch the development of the team as well really playing to the personalities and styles of their player broken blades excelled a lot on you know those damaged carries so trying to open up room that way stop being sad bottom land again we're going to focus on tactical know he's in this high pressure situation show me a Galaxy S8 is going to be pushing a lot but the various X Kenshin. That they doing that you see, you think all of this Mana spamming a day are we on the way of trying to continually shove it in to get a little bit of her ass there as well as accept pretty close to the minion but they get the recall off Prime powers of your wave on a Canon wave does get executed by for JJ there do the guy 52-cs at 10 different to go cut all seven the last play of the three call comes in Catskills consists mostly walk back without much issue msf course of sunglasses movie Speed is going to feel fine but hate NPS difference is still can be quite painful Predator I just saw activated by progress broxah fishing around on the top side but broken blades playing cautiously he knows any type of a big minion wave built-up is an objective that's Midland coming over last year someone to help out with the stop sign up in a cup of Broken Blade 3 numbers up Top Lane did the Gracchus but they knew something was up and that means that Zoe then gets to shove the wave in the Middle Lane so so she s on top side secured for Broken Blade but they lose out a couple As It Gets shoved in quickly to the tower here in Midland and drinks and kind of Paid It Forward there with a little bit of support your submissives golden altar email has been at least one of the cats finished down there you talked about him being more selfless is it here if it's not on three and he's also have quite a few moments where he talked about leadership and these things he's looking a lot more closely at with the team just to have they know they've got a problem up here on the top side because of that early well played gang from Team Liquid that well. It's nice to see Ashley Brock so kind of returning to the four people
