all right very fancy works at a moo banzet number one near Jensen honestly don't deserve more bands from Cloud 9 Benton has been at one of the main a big performers to your 14 liquid doing a lot of the work right along there with corejj you know and the bottom went all right let's get our stuff situated to this one of the prize bladder the early aggression is so damn powerful backed up by Nipsey backed up by Vulcans world have to walk for his wife we believe he couldn't Champion is not in this patch but maybe one day he'll be fun to watch for down the line and you're seeing any individual agency bands right Cloud 9hippos be limited feels like a Leo RTF vs. Hela block that would feel for okay so they're going to leave out the possibility of Galia I mean Misty was even tweeting out about please bangali against me so I don't have to play for the team does it fits five nights ago well I did lock it up every single time on the other side though for tactical I mentioned the bottom Lane till it was already banned out that is one of their more proactive combination but they have so many game with the fellas and trying to go for the later style this is a big question that people been wondering are we going to try and just wait out Cloud 9 early or are they going to try and take the fight to them signals the first option they are not going to try and take the fight to Cloud 9 in the early game if you're picking broxah a trundle it's a lot moreI'm focused objective Focus yes there are champions that you can have successful gang sign with pillar running at them and getting the slope but obviously not going to be something that rocks the prize the contestant bladder with too much early because Club Band band in early so that later on Spotify this is actually a Luck Stone Oak bottomland Shield bottom Lane that really just as so annoying to to play against this is something that Team Liquid types of styles they have used in the past when there has been healing Shield combinations annoy the heck out of peopleneed to get to like at least a core item or two and some extra levels before you'll start to just get so freaking big that they can take over these fees dragon fight if your phone is not stacked dragon versus you very early on then your team fire powers what comes through Sonos a lease deals and Lexus are we sealed applying for multiple people when you get to Lux pass through on on both of them it just provides anything's the matter right now we're evolving around bearded dragon twice as long as your opponents don't get off to a very big early lead that then that's where you can to try and take over it I like it you need chords JJ and tactical some form some way to try and punish them if you can fish for some early kills even with a triangle coming down if blitzcrank can do it all for you right you pillar that set of a possible blitzcrank pool and that means that there's not as much burden on the jungler to do soMichael the creation of the gulf and poor JJ can have his hand through the work couple of thoughts here I have Zona if she is a heart before is a stealing support you want a snack at manifold you want to Stack Up have to bind as soon as your manifolds infinite at least one that said they are lacking a hyperscale and crit marks when someone can aptly burn it down a front-line tank impact on Oren to me would make a lot of sense of like Sion orshan would work here as well then taken away they are diving in hecarim Over the Top Shot in the back like I'm so excited as a shield from all Laneslisten to pack with Olaf builds for him if you have a charging in there where bust a very long time ago do the fear duration for long-range old he's got you can get your Luck's field before you charge in Azure running up Sonos Shield you got to stand on top of you for a lot of beef bottom Lanes side of the map primitive it's one of impact very best Champions but you steal away a possible impaction and U-joint kit for licorice I really like what they said up here my question is ya handsome liquid finest can they are trying to get some blitzcrank roaming kills. Members of Cloud 9 and a break apart the synergies that exists here because so much of this is all right we've got this double Shields bottomland soda and Lux we're want them to join these mid-game team fights that's where you get all the value we don't get all these shields for everybody else I've got two thoughts I'm going to go for 1number one Good Luck stats part of this one but this feels like one of the only times that not considered a season opener where does this is us that we're all five players are playing a new Champion the first time this split play going 15 games anything like yep first-time set first time shame first time Hector and first-time setup for Silex yes events play as Sunnah before in his League career but in this play it's a new one I put up the plants that look for a good look at you proving it it's got to be rare after week 6 or so regardless the other part is this is probably the best mordekaiser pick I have seen in a very long time it is going to smash soda so hard in teamfights she cannot get away from him she wants to buffer entire team she cannot see her entire team impact me getting a ton of free ability power I don't know how he's been supposed to win that says we should probably go to be second item when you coming to teamfight phase me. To come through I like the Mortal. You to break it apart as real is safe in the back line to have to grab that you can maybe get away from Akronand are there going to be some Dives in this game yeah that's what I talk about is breaking the team apart whenever you see a team with this by Synergy like you're talking about you want combo breakers from wherever you can possibly get them well we'll see how much going to happen if we are on the rift and if the Killer Instinct is going to be enough from cloud nine or Team Liquid know what they're doing it can get through this one no conventional Marksman physical damage profile a little bit low so a tank line can be really durable here on the TL side we'll see how well set Bountiful Concentra and got a point out double spellthief bottling prevent and valgus of blabber to be poaching a crap ton apartment about link is that a technical term there I definitely agree the poaching will be revelant defensive word invade with a blitzcrank here and they are scouting easy evasive maneuvers for Cloud 9 in a good word that comes down to where it can never be seen by TL on the way Force they can't know for sure that Ward is there you can surmise in her that maybe there is a deep or the blue up but they sought to yell walk forward then turn around so the best we're going to get from TL is trying to stop lever spacing and see if they know I just love that are battle of the top teams is delivering already just in champ select free top of North America are actually innovating the only showing a game from season 10 is that Wonderstone atop gave that that's the tea to play and then for Lux there's only been one in season 10 as the support in lck for that TRX game this is this is pure and a Innovative right now it's and again it's going to come from one of those of a bottomless out things that we used to see where know we had carry Sonos and we had a lot of the active healing style ones this is going to be another one highlighting the shields Guardian before you get pallets. So if they wanted with her to see us has been in Bolton could trade off last hitting Bailey minions leave the castles up and lose 14 gold you know for a pinion but no get that money back from from doing spell decent cooldown to Golden Compass pretty closest as a result of that one I don't want to point out as a Keepsake two things at once I love there is a pregame interview from Reaper the Cloud 9 coach you said yeah it's kind of a rocky rose rock and we're going to go back to comfort pics to lock you in for Speed I love both of them. Mid lane get to pull back on the Jensen gets away from the Sun but it still goes through so full damage reduction in there as Here Comes Rasta outside. We're looking for a pillar in to hook flat look knock it's going to land here comes to look pretty soon it will not go down at full power at the moment they don't have to burn flashes for either supports player in the bottom side still looking pretty clean he recorded they didn't use his course to start that out so it takes away some of the threat nisky and the Midland yeah but that's a pillar that damage got Tristan has manafort spell combo and Brockton to Blue Buffalo chop is not going to happen taste of that how you like that for I Got 5 minutes later. Have a lesson to do push-ups a wave into the tower I think Jason will be able to clean up a decent amount of those as you can see he is still play quite far ahead and say yes Eva lynskey continually going for the aggressive plays now I might have to flash out might have this done be careful in this depop sambuca through the summer with heel Fresno and he's got to get this done but here comes TT Shen but cordage a severe as well how's it going to go not going to get back to the are the flash comes out really really good play buy licorice now finds the top of his rid of damage to kill Corte De Nosotros no hook up you got to be kidding me send crabs the kill well-played licorice Russell can't get any more this solos combined for a Kilim support hell yeah is delivering on all levels Cloud 9 fire away is a bit late they get the first blunt it is a liquor is in Stella 442 midlane impact now it does get the Shelf in the top side but as you can see on screen bottom ciphercloud night also got to push the wave all the way in and knows what it does mean is it going to start to wear a waist soften up that turret play as well then liquor is able to get back to topside pretty quickly after using a cell for cuz look at a mini nap right now before you teleport it down he shoved in the wave and one for his recall so he got on his item and he doesn't have to go back to face you just went straight stop after this really nice to meet you at once again licorice boosted music you pass through then able to get the glass out of Jensen and if I hold his tot the whole time he's able to get for JJ with it notice he also tried to block or JJ with his champion model staying on that side forcing a little bit of extra movement from him around the edge because the last impact Burns flash to her health left they're going to go for the flash on of a turret and Cloud 9 have found the aggressive plays they want kills across-the-board all right maybe it's only delivering from one side 3 cuz we keep this exciting game they are all by Cloud 9 Team Liquid right now struggling to deal with the onslaught that has come right out of Champion Select they did go for the play bottom that we are looking for sandbox it down there trying to make something happen with for JJ with you switch prank full but the shields were too much of them the bottom Lane is just looking to deny right now scale up as you mention and you know you're looking for a man is killing on him you're already purchased for Sona you're trying to get levels in these guys so that they could bring the big shield for your team fights meanwhile blabber and licorice making plays on the top side of map just like they have done all split long Team Liquid though this is the big move for them first move of the game for them to get a real advantage and they will at least get the first dragon here wow Sona and looks are still weak yeah Jensen had to push in Midland there as well shove then took the recall so they knew oh min-seok vostok to start I'm easy 3d one by was not going to show the tick that went down well played the them good pick up there so we can drink of the boards for Team Liquid 1,000 gold leave the Cloud 9 side as a SWOT liners Sheriff arm back and forth actual see if it's pretty close and Vulcan CS count as one each on taxol side his to get some of the matters of anything that corejj last just be back at school anyway 5356 be at fault line on the board as well can't notice blabber uses the ultimate rides beginning so he goes Unstoppable no chance for Jensen to try and deny him and knock him back or anything can you get a really nice combination here killing Jensen on the minion wave so that this Farm is basically but that is not going to Jensen still level 6 on the syndra death for him going to definitely set that the possibilities here for
