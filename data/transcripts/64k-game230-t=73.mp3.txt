in North America right now they just beat Team Liquid and that was with their new top later rookie come again is stepping in for electrician and Soldier killed in the incredible debut taking down in back taking down PL he was strong in this key as well was very big in that game is Veigar was so so powerful and he said that he wanted to bring out a lot of different chance can you want to experiment to bring out somebody's War weird chance than any he didn't look really comfortable against it as truth of a guy was really effective and that was pretty impressive right now they're not getting banned away we'll see what does coming through what we are play champion in Rumble more than double any other day and he hasI'm in the tournament makes sense also a different look for them I don't believe we have seen any human game I wonder if they're going to be able to grab something along the lines of this differ we've seen that before the effective super yummy I think it's is one of the strongest people with the long side it at being able to hit that problem projectile you get a slow and then the boomerang blade become very easy to connect with the multiple part of his ultimate by popular the speed up their the Cape Town potential Wisconsin's clothes can be very very strong also some pretty interesting which indirect and they're going to go see you at the drops do shake up one thing I ate early game average off of Torrid at 15 minutes they have eight or nine games of the game so far in the LCS that's actually been pretty exciting overall I like the smile is it not even enable Siri on here talking about I think she was really good and certainly Jace look like that yesterday I know this is pretty much always been the answer feels like fuyumi people are all mostly to establish baking that as an answer in an egg without a couple times yesterday it's really strong all in the game store because you're not getting an additional damage would you make such a big difference in the all-in and if you are separated you're very very formidable taxi 4th down yourself so heavy comp some of the things that used to run in Spring I doing some serious real packed stuff would not be shocked to see that added in but as real first movie is going to be in the lot if not no certainly I think pretty in an all-in-one mid laner but either way again because of the week engage TV about hard seats reliable at that on every c9m I wonder if we'll see something along the lines of Draven band or Illusion I think those can be quite a bit since now so early game he is much more known as part of a leaking fuel fighter that's more his style are we did just see Draven Ottawa to new and very well yesterday though. We have the solution. Let's be pretty effective interest as well I generally go through aggressive really gay maybe these are the ones that are more likely be able to punish but okay I guess it could be flushed around but one of these is most popular Casio with was being placed A Ton Tony was dominant honest or going to sitting here as well and I was actually going to Champions going to eat and then you know I definitely don't think that they're going to want to be to go in a full physical yeah would make some sense I could be pretty interesting but I might be getting it one more time play forward the Jason the side lane you than kind of have it this early Roman Squad of TF but they didn't they can move around the map and try to make this time I have heard about this I have her to call one of the most extreme counters in the game II don't know if it's actually going to play out in that way but I'm very excited to see if that is the case to mate here bringing out dead fetuses feel like that type I'm excited we saw that I love it I'm excited about this immediately really confused across from Friday the 4th. So it's going to be exciting and learn ways to flex their Champions around when you get a new hear another non-standard game here for Clutch Gaming Sona band away and said Cody Sun Pilots us dead I really want to see you is that going bad or is it actually said Nautilus spot cuz I'm kind of struggling to see it I mean I guess you're going to have to call them to Central there but farming early seems like it would be so hard against you be an Israel a lot of folks are still there as they're also out of my sisterly well into into your early armor a big going lines of the ice-born could make that more difficult but he is certainly positioned on the bottom side and her for the chats I've had a really was expecting to be Zed mid because that is a match of that it had been very hyped up quite a bit as an answer to see if what's been gaining popularity buenos soon we will have interview with Mixcraft we running him up in a minute so we can ask him directly just was special about this and when I hear word will pass that over but meanwhile Jimmy had initially sent Khalifa another bottom now we walk backwards mid so it does look like they are pushing those players to their respective roles that said he'll be a mid laner but piloted by Cody sent that makes way more sense to me I just think it's so important to actually get the expiry so later on these assassins that needs to hit those break points out to be able to be effective in the game thanks guys I did Chase down coach mix crack asking about Cody Sun spot Atlantis for Cody sun and that's surprisingly he's really good in that position so I'm excited to see it back to you guys and learn W and try to Jack the blue buff and how many free throws flash over the wall for that tonight I'm saying like 100 there's like yeah there's like Spence Karen and mlxg does little people are already taken but that'll leave one by showing your yeah and that's why I haven't done yet might come in we'll see what happened to him in a while for us we saw two level one came in and pushed him off made him burn teleport the very beginning of the game that is a another missing some of that mean I don't have a friendly date has been pushed back quite a bit of you. The man he was up in one second could have easily queue Smite it's not about whether he had two flat for the next 3 minutes. Also I got he's a boss I guess Battle of a nail talk to corporate me to giant fish will see what else happened to the audience that song is old man I've heard in the last Nikki going to be a lady up here again to the syndra that does seem like I think like a much more difficult matchup then was the last game you have really good push even when they were killed off in the last game they were able to actually do get if you have to bandage over FBI as well as who he wave was pushed forward so if it's going to be an acre almost landing and defending clutch will go to a weed this way is down so down goes through the minion remind me to low Mana today are actually just using it to try to reset but for now I'm going to get the reset because they're at their willing to take up a little girl sitting on a Teleport to want a very likely will have to teleport back in and just try to get this wave reset what team is that is scary to do because you have no idea where the lease in is there at the tour Duty be back in you could just be in seeing it so he's going to have to actually make the tell for into the river and interest rate to slowly walk for it and make sure that gets loose at the bottom and middle is going to text images of Fate I know we mentioned in champ select the need for some magic damage potentially in this roster and Misty will steal deal some stacked deck of course of magic damage fix card wild-card contributions there but it is still attack damage GF tells me that they're looking for more I think definitely can work and C9 has not been seen that is as ever really been afraid of it. you are some big damage on PC will be as real some from the TF and then you me is is adding some magic damage in there so it's all bad we will see exactly what sort of style of beer I want to go but lira in a cook at the preferential itemization if he wants us to a full tank before backup the armor that could be helping him out I think in a world where you have quite a bit of damage on your squad already maybe he's got to feel free couples to do that country calls coming through Kumo Fort without TP get 3 longsword to take the long way back up to the Lane and he's okay Walk This Way over now and who need I think it's actually holding on to somebody with fries up here the wave is bigger than two most I think it'll be actually a lot of Farmall 230 C is 29 to 45 FPS and it's going to get worse for him so toppling going well so far and I got a lot of iron by the fact that that level one was very brutal and of course the Tepee out spot putty telnet looking to try to set up any potential all in this key the other advantage of kind of going for this phase Rush when you are going to the ADP app is the early on right yes. Washroom he's waiting for that to my life is sitting behind him and maybe she can walk for a little bit more lyrics flag and dragged away a lease in was around I didn't bring the big Summoners any big cooldowns and made him so again here he knows how process of a d vs yuno a p on the TF certainly I think at this point would be even if you had like Secret Agency is more useful but at the same time I'm building to his Tony has nearly as easily which is so helpful against his head and unless you want to do some 30 hybrid not sick but there's a lot of damage that was really well done honestly no chance for who he be rather once he's use the ultimate there's no way you're going to go without play that so 59 very clean dive doesn't cost them a Summoner Mickey and Daisy will be pushed back office for a little bit then lose a plate. But looking like not much more than you know the few CS is as well as her place is certainly much better trade 459 on the top side especially when you realize he was starting to really win that length quite a bit and Elmo needed to help you really bad back over Top Lane
