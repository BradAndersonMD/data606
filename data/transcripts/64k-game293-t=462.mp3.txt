I've been seeing a lot of crows experimenting with some different Picton soloq fracture think of these different strategies in excited to see if anyone's going to break it out right off the bat comes out through here as well quick things to do when I can't talk about nurse coming through lissandra so far globally and 9.2 is the highest presents mid laner that is the most common to happen in that role I expect to see her picked in this game a band away but we are mid Oregon 1/4 still really really up there a Sox lost a little bit of presents but is still, as well so we'll see what I come through most likely get away from the tank top lace you're directing solo to do well as broken play piano Casio band just yet we'll see if she has time is going to be forced into that band a Casio has been considered at least in my Moto Pros to be the strongest pic of this is a picture of a lot of people talking about as a triple Flex at is going to get banned away we did see the atrox go to Broken Blade in his loss actuallywhat he did look very strong at the inlay and getting multiple solo kills on hunie we do know this can also reflect over to Bjergsen so you know strong early Flex pick their yeah I was going to be answered by another Flex pick me up from TSM in the irelia we could be seeing the irelia going top we could be seeing eye vac blowing mid likewise with the lysandra here I have even seen a little bit of expecting definitely black Pixar the name of the game soccer is well and that looks like that foreign days locked in here now it's something hover waiting for Phoenix the Locking as well either way though normally Champions are most frequently seen top that can't be true for all them anymore or it's the sport is a pretty big like you wouldn't get voted out a lot last week because we going most liked it too hotthat is definitely what I'm expecting you also can see aatrox jungle so it could be no Jace madorin top Asos jungle so there's a lot of flexibility here for Echo Fox but as it's standing I've definitely expecting the Jason try to be matching up with the irelia the order to be going to 4th and likely then leaving that eat rocks are against lesandro we will see if he's actually how they want to prioritize these matchups then if they want to try to mix things up and and maybe confused yet I'm a little very little bit of for example j-spot Lynn and Apollo was one of the players last time this is definitely a very flexible line apples to its really come through your freckled Fox but midlane is still open as a possibility here with admitting things like orange before aatrox jungle today's top afraid of that since you're coming through as a middling kind of picking that's what if you get some fans right here. So far this season we have been seeing a lot of Corky9 barkston but if it's somewhat in that you know the sort of the style of play the chase in the mid lane a second as real game going to be coming in here for his friend who had his best game of the season in there winds are only on the Ezreal look at very very confident he'd be drafted like this a lot of physical damage already being drafted by echo-fox a lot of diving and kind of attack toward that marked position without the physical damage magic damage jungler I'm trying to think of things that aren't there but he did say he did thatall I know. I would not believe I said in front of the other team real things that Russia ever says I feel like you'll be a jungle pick to come in last 40 years before they like that one down at the fox at the Lock in there will come just as well they do probably need some magic damage and I think they needed for Apollo and and with rise being locked in I feel like I talk to me like that and then dry cough but definitely a pretty a typical Draft come here from Echo Fox on standard I could be the date that you said I could certainly fit down there a rise Vada something that has a little bit of popularity as well can help us a foreign know you can throw down the room prison the pillows behind then you can come and get that knocked up the chain off of that haven't seen a fair bit of Aftershock Rises well installers you a lot of people really liking that is providing on the man with that W Yep this is a very non-standard style of draft that Xbox hasn't with e415 you really do have to punch to face half the snowball the game that is not something I think we're you I don't want to go late against a girl who's going to be really hard to walk down with the additional safety there of the X Kenshin powerful dive when you're looking at lissandra Nocturne irelia who can fly into the back line and could be really difficult for someone like Jace or rise to revive against that yeah there's not a ton of this side of his okay don't get me wrong but this'll be fun to watch Forrest. Jason will be locked in for a paladin that's what is Champions are in this matchup I'm not fragile that wasn't all that was going to be very very fun on both these teams one and won their only loss is coming to The Undefeated Clutch Gaming back in a week one of us will be more of them later on is going to be a battle has been very excited about TSM did you look very good they were in control inelastic clutch last week expected winter here but I feel Fox early and look great in with the god fist Lee sin app to pick up this game definitely came this is what the fans happened wanting from this is what they think about when they think of Rush when they think of his dominant performances back on table do you want to be p s certainly is this style of play I need you to be set up well with powerful solo laners to arrive any trucks both strongly as the game for their where to see if he can take over this game and fish tackle box do the victory do these teams tied one and one Echo Fox and TSM doing battle rash on his trademark Gleason DSM all looking pretty sharp and broken plate on a pretty Heights upcoming in known for his high mechanics Champions it's play another Carrie matchup we see him beat someday and hunie in laying in the very first we can go up against solo is very good that has a chest out play here and there really was a truck match oh yeah I'm in a really has been kind of checking all the boxes a lot of people were concerned about you how he would be able to perform especially with such a tough report in week one you're going up against Tony is dumb day two of the strongest top laners in the league certainly and he looked very good getting sold Hills on both of them the only criticisms I've really been seeing Levi towards this guy is that with the leaper happy head over honey there are better ways he maybe could have played around the map to snowball that game but certainly has been an extremely impressive player looking like a really strong acquisition for CSF are absolutely he's here now we are into this game random note I do want to bring up Apollo was the work-in-progress name of Jace actually when he was being developed so a bit of a name Synergy there it got changed over the course for public but I thought it was interesting so there you go. You know Jay in both of these last week that was 200 on that right and you know we haven't seen it elsewhere in the world will hens famously bring it out in the lck a lot of players looking towards Griffin and saying let's do that pretty good at League of Legends Olaf Olaf with Redemption yeah it's really everywhere coming to the Jungle so a lot of players are really trying to learn as much as they can definitely one of the teams that has helped to popularize the allowance for the early Lenny face down to the Portland can't say I've seen a lot of days for down here it's kind of a friend every once in a while but I surely both very Poky both pretty minimal I ever going to be probably Sears at about these characters on pretty early on but currently it is supposed to lead to Echo Fox and it gives Russia bit of control over this site said leave for the reward still be seen by force, but either way I can't even take a cop's gun without much tissue expecting Acadian to be able to at least get one of those early priority on the vision around here we'll see if if she's going to try to make a concerted effort to take away this blubaugh and it may end up in vertical style dumpling and as it seems like Rush is going to head up there knowing that the vault did Rome out of Lane we need to see Acadian head straight down to Echo Fox's blue buff and just pray that away so a bunch of guys making intelligent choices I think it nearly minutes here and it's expected that he's through the Raptor camp that washes least it has not and they're just to be traded a blue bus going in the Bronx right now so it is a small XP and ncsf didn't hear me when we get these vertical jump legionarios when the jungler chronicles of life and in fact. Right because some Douglas will try to stay and actually three it out in full clear that's out of the map to be up an additional where is Others May only do the Boston to be worried about a class or BBQ camps and then be worried about 5 so we'll see is Durham going for that. We are and it looks like likewise Acadian is actually just going to leave the little willful Ivan and do a full can of clear here also looks like both jumpers leaving a small wolf but again the difference in the Raptor Camp is here right now but R Us Toys R Us the Middle Lane Phoenix can look for the but the year of the walls going to put jerks into safety this mid-length plus 7 for the DS emulator the top side of the map where his jungler is knowing that wrecked would have to be coming from that bottom quadrant make that is very easy Escape for intelligent positioning and tell her to come back awareness there that is allowing him to to make that gank was so non-threatening right but also you should always get it right picture of you on the bottom is pretty good damage I hear pops couple of riddles that he's supposed but got a new free one from Optimum he's doing pretty good about that but has real Tom kench I really don't feel like you're flying to Iceland to win anyway you're playing this land to farm to stay safe so that really does leave me to believe that your son is going to plank heavily towards the top side map looking to gain Coastal lands with a que tienen as I talked about Xbox does have strong soul in the game for the police in very well as irelia fuel and that's even though klint is available in Phoenix you might just get first down to a doctor and also plus a full of Sondra combo increasingly common Sophia definitely is kill a bowl of the plays go to write on the TSM side you can cleanse the one son but actually comes out for the cool down his back back in the second round of jungle clear keep my we are at knife-point see where the camps are work a little bit less XP after the first round of response across Pro play it as mint 17 seconds later to get to level six call worldwide Pro play Seventeen seconds later the office for junglers now despite what is early OSHA 30 seconds of going to release him grab the right there is Rosh and that's exactly what is massive especially for a lot of Champions Michael Jace like the ride that is going to be really really big for them and really often times it's just like a free Winfrey or laning phase is there are from then on out so excellent job by Echo Fox utilizing the fresh with a hat on the bottom side of the map they have the winning to be do they have a strong early jungler and they have already made good on that with that Dragon stuff right here than it is slightly up for TSM again you can see roughly one Camp does fornicating the headgear in the Middle Lane is almost a full wave and a half here for bjorksten but otherwise it's pretty close. Thank you very much no more detailed breakdown of the at 1:50 right there in the jungle and another 150 in the mid lane that promote the DSM Advantage is right now on top of this one is still low but not be subjected to a K-1 visa to up your butt when he will be nice truck by Katie Weldon knock up spine enough my room to cut that out and broken play taking one purchase too many had the flash available with on the ultimate did not back out of the Tower and that is too early kills going the way of Soul of what an owl play I believe a lot in Solo last year I thought you was one of the best players on what's despite the big-name still showing up here today and here is his one more time I don't know I was in anticipation of a joke that that's what I'm going to assume there but misses on the ultimate and then it was like from here they should have been able to actually grab the kill but broken Play Just decides okay I'm going to hold the turret you finish up this is knock up there in the Saving Grace broken by taking one turn shot too many and then knock up buying enough time for solo to get to kill there so that's really messed up there from TS diamond gold still very close to even but significant Advantage for solo now on the top light and the old lady in gold belt with a safeguard advantage and kills them a hundred gold but also get Vonage instead I'm going to spell it has both those flyers up there burn their flash sew Acadian is down resources however it is an option to level six between that repeat that can happen if you have to keep in mind that there was a pink where there's that word is turned off I don't know that Rush is in his Bush he is Kid Flash available around here comes rise as well
