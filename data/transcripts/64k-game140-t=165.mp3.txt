how to static between flyquest and golden Guardians here a bit more later on as well and there is rhythm band was coming I'm sorry if I ever played against by Feist on Blue Sky self tell me that I kind of noticed in this final week that we're going to be playing on patch 10.3 before 1/2 Des Plaines to rock a nurse a lot of things just didn't put into practice time which I can't necessarily fault them for since you kind of knew that strategy was going to get nerfed anyway so I can fly push one was clearly it looks like they have them until it may be hard to deal with a big bruise that band for now because of the choices they made for thinking about to be there an author had a good soccer game I'm not sure that people way the wind is going to leave Pro play anyway so here is orange at the table as well andcan't argue with the power been specifically FBI's affiliate had been good but they were also kind of respecting Turtles a bell pepper and fresh picked at which has become somewhat of a normal thing as well as though might just being even more of that as time goes on it's not like a real to Sian set bonus but it just blinds of the theme song for the well yeah I really like it when coaches come in prepared with kind of a flow chart of what they're going to do things kind of go to planet Earth quick with their lockers because it does put pressure on the other team do not have as much time to think so we saw a cassette very quick loginboth sides and now the debater by Kodak Black on which support doing yeah forecast Misfortune with a lot of teams go with Liliana for a kind of more all in but at least this week we're seeing a higher priority on this Ratchford its ability to save people and I think it's a good pick for Keith support player who made mostly a role in Korean solo queue and probably keep scratching by a long shot so anytime you can get performance when a player is so above and beyond the bill like marginal value get from any other bands that I would just wrote down every single time is better than CNNDown the Line Band. Disrespect expected value from a ban vs like champions in a vacuum with power so can you breathe through their also like to point out ignore did not grow if he had a ton of LTS support that you should just be pulling out every game in the last weekend then do it for us that one fourth fourth 5 to become the front whenever him I get to play at least have it in and hops off closer I am a very big fan of so far the four Golden Gardens I get to go to pick one color to really rest I hope so I think it is actually in Uno plus not being ignored already playing the Ratonyeah show Super Fan they need magic damage and they have to have a line double Zoe and Ariana are too blind pics or on his something Pardeeville has been good in the past they were packing everything his Pretoria of the split but as you mentioned it is time for the answer in the mid lane and you're going away forces that was banned yeah that was one where Joey is something that a lot of teams are willing to Blind Creek anyway but has not necessarily something to go into it but Golden Goose couldn't do that for team composition reason they have all physical damage do except there's a way to pick you uplisten to go into tank makes no sense there for Speed / con and Rec but I can put out enough gold and items as well as it does look relatively standard in terms of not being surprised champions in the draft but I would stay fly Quest book to have a pretty darn Strong by B5 Oriana with a high potential for comboing as well as I recalled just having that strong to fight footprint and golden Guardians I think we'll have to be able to have like a pretty strong 20 minutes maybe get some dragons to play around and licking if you want to win this one also finds good Misfortune open to have a lot of that really great really really nice in the Boxsquat down but a bunch of the season-long for FBI in second With the Wind here all your schedule was easy tie for second this is the end of the first round robin you played every other team wants and are tied for second of golden got his win this one flat outside would be alone in second with no hopes that on catching them if they close out this for the win and that everyone want and I have the best record. 9 I mean looking around the world there is a lot of parody right now like aside from cloud nine who is at least three losses going on for losses ahead of every other team you look at the LEC was just wrapped up their week 5 they have16/4 in 1 game between 1st and 6th there is a lot of teams playing each other close early on in the LCS is no different here Wells Fargo in FBI actually dancing off mirroring for the removal of C the body yeah I meant not severe pain on Broadview but nothing like that in the brush is better than not we clean the brush that's true it means you're already moving and Direction like when it's killshot happen again next part of the lamps up on you almost never over matter is true but sometimes that like 1 and 500 thing that you do ends up being really big difference and it was that and that was game 5 world championship for something you know if you know like every once in a while he's a big boy. If you want to do like the fastest level 3 on Rex I will do wolves red rugs and then be able to get by in like a few seconds faster than maybe now it's going to be pretty easy Red Bluff kill blue is being skip as you mentioned and I don't think but I'm broke neck rugs & Beyond this point three of those Foggers of a lot of gold and specifically red side against Rex eyes really hard Mickey was talking about this when he cast some of the LEC match because of the size of that wall down there Rex I'd just come get you from so many different angle it's really difficult reward amount still looking to play around that box. Taking down the rest of the chickens on your got to say hey that's flash or Flash FBI really quick reactions are by FBI kind of knew that we got to be careful the closure is it actually in addition to cover yet but Santorum can't know that and kind of has to back away while FBI really wants to stick around to get sick and she has a flat for flashover although I don't get in here and they can what's a fight for the Scoville level 3 can't leave for closer wearing a blue buff it's not that important concert can't put in the Viper is top is pushed in and kind of interesting evaluating this early game of like where should send touring go cuz on one hand yes you have desire back on right side but like scat plus X Tower Dives or just really really good one of the reasons his priority is so high cuz he can push it and I'll trade almost everyone a really love or just threaten us all look alike a map of the route I thinking about a GameStop no flashes on 80 carry or support Miner Farm leave for FBI and Keith down here is that wave his manicured down and they know what that reason for using the closer is not close apps to make sure they're going to be safe I know the truth or wonderfly Quest a little bit aggressive there by Golden Guardian I can see that they were feeling confident because they had an Aftershock brush and tree versus to but they don't actually have that much damage with a doran's blade and a longsword so watching it one more time like what I wanted I was just making sure they can shove it in because if you guys going to go back to base and get damaged but instead he likes even on cool down from FBI when they go for this throw the path yeah they exhaust Turtle it is a really good double knockout with slows down the damage but I don't really see a situation where that's not at least a one-for-one trade which you just not worth the dive can understand the golden Guardians wanted to punish The Flash work on but definitely no worries there it felt like the second time I've seen today where the sport took the exam ignite I saw that there was afraid and I think the first through the day where there was all it against the recliner who like had all of his links available glycol exhaust used to get moved like it's like I don't need you to walk or Die For You exhausted I had was like son locked anyway then you know take Summerhill when you know little bit longer like I felt like you play you do with a knife and it happens when you think Jeff like summer choices are very ingrained in muscle memory and ignite fitness Portland for like a couple of years but on neck patches. Actually last a little longer so maybe teams are already starting switch back over now blows is in a lot of things right now cuz he's around and brings him to safety yeah but now they can threaten dive on bought flashless on both FBI and key but unable to push the wave in good job by FBI and keep down bought to actually make the wave not be at the challenge problem is though you can see the recall difference write the fact that one of those really close at all you just know we never take any trade you always play the back foot for Mountain Drake and now the question will become how quickly do they set up Rift like it gets easier for flyquest here if this bottom line can stay for stuff it means they can always be the first people to reset for 8 minutes when they run out this way so that's actually why you see closure already driving and getting some few things you didn't because it would be really hard to Golden Gardens to Max's retro Swap and it's like what does it right they could start running Wii with game closed right now is topside here and maybe he's helped out with life in the Old With You by Hans are they damaged but yeah really no actual gang to be had and less Piper gets a little but I didn't know you there I just kind of been on viper he hasn't looked great on things that aren't ribbon he's getting Frozen by Hunter here but he's also kind of okay with it cuz we ever do cigarettes help fight let me see funny farm right now in my prince EP without it is what it is like to waves that's going to call TT burn he can actually just run by and if there is a referral if not like you can see that already running a bot Lane the rest of the team running straight towards this Rift Herald so that is the place like Weston it's it's hard to match by Golden Gardens right there is leaving their bottom Lane so they're losing out on Farm down there and Hunter has recall these little bit afterwards on it and they they both are preserved as Greece but that BS or difference of course still there are you still don't want to take him with any fight that involves wildturtle when he was being that it is flashed out of this is but with all the way from almost any mini for crowd control I'm going to go by with Saint Peter's I still don't like to on suet still Lane pressure like in The Herald
