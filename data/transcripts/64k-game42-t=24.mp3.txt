audio. I'm not either anyway Team Liquid had an eight-game winning streak in one of the series ever LCS finals 50 record the series out incredible play so far tour the first time at Worlds the third see if I can do season look at makes one keep on going to lose the gate one stay on Blue in the band look office Emily but they did make finals in Spring we have to remember that they got a year if you think about them naked as a finals in both splits you know this organization I think I was really just had such an incredible year that both as far as performance and branding and everything like what has been having an amazing time Team Liquid obviously a slip in spring back to their winning ways it feels like in summer but they are looking to do more than just perform in the regular season they want to win another shipif they had won four straight prior to Spring and that is kind of their base line with expectations they are going to change something up here is not that first picture sent it will be toward the Caitlin I expect all over the den that make sense now I'm curious if Team Liquid will then grab the Border Keizer or GP right here that is kind of what I'm expecting and I'm expecting TL to not play the dive comp I think they're just going to go back to how they were playing in the regular season in which is front to back to you buy more like what's like west-style was you know so you could go for something like DP Oriana and just play front-to-back Slow standard team v v v v that Team Liquid is so good at dannemora Kaiser I think makes a lot of sense it was between this and GP for me so not really surprised whatsoever I'm definitely seeing what's coming through now in the Trap like was putting an increased priority on to the has ears thing it's really important to keep this off of gun to his most plates and split by far with something fix is azir for Jensen if he of course a great team fight madeself pops off the oil Oriana House of Citrus County Road okay last pick 4 TL have been and of course Oriana was on the table the whole time to make game ones, Patty flight opposite of a dive comp and the day they now have the organic here as well and of course I think you have the ant with apps you have to grab that before it's too late otherwise the 83 treeless drops off a cliff and so this is always the lock and I think unless you're willing to go down to like the gin or whatever or you want to play something people regret losing her Calista baby but that really doesn't feel like like my style so everything's going very much to expectation I would say especially on TL style and something I do think that they are individually very proficient on these different style Champions like Roxy piloted the acronym well in Jensen's a great akali but they're 15 as a hold with less comfortable when they are playing that stylemake sense to see them just go back to the way they have one for years and years front back 5 V 5 flag Quest may just want to try to ban out Morgana tahm kench go to words with fresh again and that was very successful for them last time but of course Team Liquid would have the last band you do to be able to answer that with a fresh band if they are at all concerned about that pic because it was very successful in enabling ignore to to really get things done anything to see if you look with respect peppermint the best jungler in the game and I'm going to guess they have screamed at for throughout the back half of the year and ended early playoff setup as well because hecarim has not yet been seen us entrance Champion full but is vandeweghe here by tle course they really picked it flew to 3 in the first game there is well torrent Central and drops off the Olaf engraved yeahis also really really strong combo in the first game as well just wondering are they most concerned about the dive they are going to take away the thrash Tomcat was left up so it wasn't necessarily what flyquest was that she going to be looking towards but things like Lisa still available is a favor for both of these guys but they're actually not grabbing a tie in the last riseI think I think looking for for sumterville Opening match of 4th and 4th I think it is and that is why they're not going to go for the sit here and he said I think it's strong is that was with enable pretty have Levi's the thrushes well with a no entrance into a lot of these gangs Caitlin wachs I really like this is incredibly powerful great that's that played in Pro play maybe just in the game. Right now. It has so much zoning especially when you're going up against The Rock on work on as almost nothing to this Lane without gagging distant you can't just go in and if Lain if it has bush is so incredibly hard to Lane against because if they get to push what they will do is go set of traps on one side of the tower feel drop the Lucent Singularity velocity on the other side of the Tower and you just have nowhere to step without being harassed have nowhere to step to safely Farm if you try to squeeze past the Gap in a trap you can usually get hit by a finding it is going to be bald hair for box that's a pretty safe standard Southwe could see something like the Kindred if he wanted to go for you know something that is Maurice Kealing pick and has a bit of an advantage here cause it's whooping interesting you know for the added dive alongside you have the same United on the closet to have the recondo come through I've been seeing this pic play some indie LIC as well as in some of the other regions that there are a lot of squishy members over on the team liquid side generally causes feels pretty feast-or-famine to me but I do think alongside work on and Shen Yue have the dive buddies they are you have the ability to to get going in this game but it does feel like it would be pretty difficult to win any sort of a 1D one against the Volver who is going to be tanky enough going to withstand your birth and no has a pretty strong clear himself see what I can get done with this it is going to be his first play on the champion this split and I'm trying to remember if there's even a single kha'zix play in the ALCS this split I tend to think I want to but we could get it confirmedEvan one here there regardless of anything to get last pick for a scent wanted to play kha'zix into this one I want to see if TL can be split up enough that he can find the isolated damage cuz it's is good because of the eyes with a Q dealing more than double damage their on targets and yes of course get that one to happen of course the Pegasus could be good as well you got Fairly reliable CC in a couple of slow so we'll see if I can come through We R Who We R fat composition for LCS finals in the last 5 split a blip in Spring but back of the top performer in summer can they do it again is the question meanwhile flyquest on their way to Navy or second LCS final and their first-ever title if they can keep this one going and we are going to have this upper bracket final match happened here today like what's a team liquidgoing to be a good one mean if it's like most wins this game it's just get them so much momentum in the series you know they have I had the ability to bring out some kind of fixing some unique Champion Select already in playoffs with some of that this might be fixing to the power of evil so you don't want to put them in a position where they kind of just take a swing like that no Team Liquid back on Comfort they need to perform here I think in a settle down the nerve see if they can really run over this game and I do think they have the ability to do that through bottom line because I think this is such a heavily favored to V2 towards TL side really the only chance that is you know post sick looking for an Engaged or having the jungler come down and finding you know flashing gauge on 24 JJ and tactical because work on dad's almost zero in the TV 2 and Watson and Caitlin are to the strongest Lane police in the gameyeah I'm looking up what could have happened here as we get the year of the Jungle starts and of course Angela get the red pretty much instantly knock down things like for the Raptors pretty easily but I think it's so absurdly TL favored supposed to work in and you know what congressional world are the champions of balance is okay you've got to think on the other right but it flips whatever the engage is good if you have damaged to break through the shielding but this is Premier plus this is absurd and he's running Guardian is just incredibly fairly strong and I just means that there's a lot of damage really on the rakan + Ash to actually break through a lunch you like that you are engaged to go okay light binding and we don't lose any help so nice engagement and it gets even worse because he's out thereOllie's it before they gave Susan Collins all the things you have to do to you have a chance at working plus Deluxe is playing he'll do they have cleanse over on on tax bill so the Ashera wasn't going to be as silly as effective and there's no Keel over on the on turtles because he has to respect the TDCJ number of any sort of mining in traffic on those because if you don't have plans and you get if I won binding that full combo can just need that little rain cleanses fight a car has no potions already tried to fight 4 minutes out of the turret socialite lighting to Caitlin McHugh Auto and that was really gone right there and not going to steal back heels back up 4:40 and 4 to take walks out of it says I mean I'll just you know do 40 damage to you it's still the more defensive option to play run all living but I mean Corgi just Shane Farm Gold by just using spellthief's and just now go for the rest of this option it's fine I'm just not capable exactly if you think there's no way that they can actually went in and out without a bill to go for you know when you can look for thoseUW trades wages Shield himself locks board and it's like was traded to the shield they're going to lose that pretty heavily you can see the beginnings of what I was talking about here let me see an earlier levels you don't have enough traps to fully cover the line but rap on each side send a WhatsApp to cover the hole gap on the left side of that Tower meaning you can't both avoid the Poke and actually Farm Heroes wildturtle and that's where you have to try to start squeezing around the traps you open yourself up to potential finding it just becomes incredibly difficult I mean they lost the Torah play on like the second wave so it's really tough for knocked it downall right well we keep on going to this one is still have the early lead and farm is + 9.2 because Turtle can't last hit everything underfoot it's hard to say no to help overall he's going to walk around with some more covers himself may be as far as first three calls coming through on a couple different sizes and the final recall it comes out of the mid lane by Jensen if he comes in for both sides going to be a different piece to want to point out how are people I believe was not comet in game 1 musical Tempo switch over to comets we can do more poke here in his one-on-one get to Blaine apartment still get to get a bunch of Mana through his room choices in this matchup he knows that Jensen will be able to trade back playing arrange restraint match up here so he does want the comet to be able to come to compete with that folk a little bit more it is also confirm that this is actually the firstkha'zix the split so I was right with that one and and santorin know we'll see how well he can't perform in as I said it has been played in other regions but first time in LCS display. To see in central one who has been a very team have a jongleur first blood king of the league spent a lot of time here is his support and rest of the team as well do what you can do on this assassin currently down 1° calls come through a red light with a long sword it moves on and of course this first break is alive and fertile you'll have it for a good move to the right to get him out but it does mean the Bronx is forced to run for his life and when you have the upfront person the fight starts looking pretty bad for Center on the reason Proctor really has to run it because he knows that ignore is there, there is a spot in the Eastern NC on the flank there but if he gets spotted I meanCork and evil and a cute wake up the dragon dragon off the back ignore probably died so I will probably. All right well he is able to get out of there so far no pretty calm game here and Jensen but impacting to take down top schedule what about later okay XP needs more time because I'm a gold 14 Tire Gate Court was on cool down so he was just trying to get priority there but because of the cracks me up gently didn't have to baste so you're not only did they get that sell crab because in fact move down and we had control the river was able to go for any fruit boxes moving over here though we'll probably just try to help him around the side is your tickets load put toward down see sent over that box light off they need to push it over with p o e be offended that a little bit more they could have potentially set up a free and forced Jensen to stay around because the reason broccoli come there is is obviously yes he told him to go to kill but really realistically you're just trying to push in the waves allow Jensen to reset because Justin has no teleport at NoMa can aloe help so he needed to go back to base and that's why they tried to get it pushed into the tower there maybe 5 play that little bit differently and try to defend that a bit more aggressively because I didn't have shockwave and because he didn't have much help I feel like they might have been able to pull that off on the day is going to be the case where Team Liquid her up 400 gold and plus a pick axe pick up hours but you can see
