I just didn't respond to you there how do you prove that I was here I would make it to the cameras on and they wouldn't do it but it would be fine either way I talk to that was today when he was grabbing lunch then I was like doublelist I need some spicy infant information what's going on do you say like freak why did you follow me here I mean the coach getting fired over now that have native with rate so I assumed he was joking we'll see Bobby start a lot of people do pretty pretty highly public that they were taking some breaks at work in a little bit burned out after MSI week 3 now though they have to ramp back up I know they were not happy about the fact that they were out to this sort start they want to be make you throw up there in a in a really comfortable position. They are very early on in the season blocking and play off securing their world strips need sorts of things are really important to the squad likewise had a good spring split they are off to a rough start here to one and three other than one of the things that people were expecting to perhaps Talon those top three quads and no they did have one really good win against you at the time that is one of those upper echelon to use the people have predicted at the beginning of the split but still it was they are going to need to and look at the smile on his face hovering the York impact hear us all a top little bit stronger as we switch the time to take down a figure with a do you want to play styles of course the only hundred percent camping across the top five weeks in the summer split is Silas a truck the most out of the top cleaner overall but will be what I left ends up going could go mid or top eight. We are all the house not really been getting played in Jungle warm is it in N A I recently know there is still tainted Bloodlines of rides are we had been seeing quite a bit of that before styling I've been developing is diving act independently of work on a people are not always feeling like you have to grab that do it together we've been seeing Sia Nautilus dialect xayah rakan so even though I teams are often than for Savannah or Contour fuel if they ask do you still have all these other great pairing that can be put alongside it yeah there's a lot of value here as guests Team Liquid as well for the day is really best on this Gators record has been I would take his best champion of the Year bisaya taken up you are less likely to want that Champions We Believe by good marks you also probably push for JJ down his tier list as well there is a ride that picked up for Jensen we now know pretty much a hundred percent of the time that is a truck stop with rides in Atlanta now it in effect next what are going to take against died in the bottom Lane players are really feeling that it is the ride of made supports that a lot of these guys are coming back in people are really struggling to actually deal with luck support in particular a lot of players have been talking about know just how what is a couch drawing is no gets all in Champions League Aftershock people don't think that you can actually worth it down a plane and go new Guardian it and how a lot of a HPD riding a team fight through that W max deal that you're throwing out and hitting your teammates with so you should see if anyone does Lucky grab Luxor if it's going to get taken away grabbing the ribbon I love it again brings it out I'm excited to see this time it's time to watch them fly out with him before matchup definitely very exciting in there. When you're having to Banter and chance like before so they are certainly ready to go by 4 was playing his signature ribbon against the attempt in that one win that they do have in this split. Farhi absolutely popped off and I came was looking very very good it's there is that work on band that I was talking about because such a powerful pairing it doesn't look very often draw that band but you have people are still comfortable sharing it along side and has died alongside some other high-priority support the right now both need their support you got the look of a needs a bot later for doublelift right now it's like West needs a jongleur so we'll see if we get some decent bands you have horses been banned me how to fly a quest to get rid of severe who is probably the right after Isaiah is really a decent sick as well but it's still much more in the pool overall and feed liquid are they going to push on their sport fan down because like us get first dibs or do they try to pinch been to one school a little bit with only skarner really grabbed up and only Olaf otherwise band there's kind of an ocean opportunity down there and we'll see as the time ticks down but the final bands going to be running out of time and it will be at least because you see the spine physical damage with the ribbon used Tiffany want to win Top link to the champion magic damage juggler would have fit that bill well around that Top Lane the ribbon to be to Elisa's incredibly powerful really Adept at pulling off those Dives as well on the top of the map how to do believe that it was released paired up with the ribbon in their last game against the salmon is that work out quite well for them if we do get erect I hear people you can I give the edge to wreck site in the earlier stages but it becomes very difficult for exide of to fight into a scar on her because people are going to Warrior people are going to damage build these days if you bro when does he fight until they get caught it up by that scar know you can get Focus down before you're really able to get much of anything done and you're not kind of like a back where you can just build a Key West a Sunday after a job to do well right that's a lot more as a rock so long we thought that when they read through believe when they played against optic last week it was this Caitlin wachs as well to Victor in the mid lane and know they were seated upon the very very heavily they really did a struggle in that game too kind of deal with the with some of those strategies so it will be interesting to see if they are going to be able to pull this off themselves the Nautilus will be the selected gear for JJ so what was the fourth I mentioned earlier than 10:00 really be paired up well with desire it is not I wasn't as powerful as the response work on it's more kind of one-dimensional you have incredible engagement do not have that disengage jumping in and out of places for content to put that being said with the root with your fucking your ultimate you were setting up for those feathers to then be following up on that with a route from desire so can be quite powerful in that regard but that being said if you cannot all in lust and Caitlin will put you in it we poke at your turret and they are certainly going to be drawing attention you have to feel from Santorum from pobelter everything's we on those grounds down to that bottom size otherwise they can threaten those pearly Tower tapes and that is when Caitlin teams pain Snowball the game very heavily can move around the map and really take over both side Lanes as hotbeds for Action down you can find a hook on the Luxor Caitlin some really big damage can be done of course they're going to keep trying to speed run with you look at side and on the other side of it of course I'm going to be able to match up ribbon to upload Dodge away from both the the the sweethearts of the atrox to Dodge Iowa. - Board of damage and I can be very very aggressive only one will be very soon see how this plays out stylist pretty powerful off the steel HR salesmen pretty Goods Garner ultimate luck that I think are coveted mean 3 but there's nothing absolutely game-changing besides maybe that's an excuse me I do believe that that game that deal had what effect do you think you'll see if they can so I did have to put his was this bottom Lane that they did face off it really struggled to really get much done because of the power of the DD's drop traps on one side of the turret do you loosen Singularity that Lefty on the other side of traffic is really tough to approach point out as a favorite team plus he's looking a black vest have been very good team so far this year I always do like putting out what it spells these Lucknow Aftershock is this Anarchy stone that make a mistake that helps her stay alive again stomach Nautilus you can save her Q4 when there is natural fight game through the armor doesn't die in the movie to butt selfies in the games I've mostly scene of La Porte IN Pro play she frequently has to start playing defensively against other engage the fourth and get these very very late Quest complete the results from what I have seen I prefer coin unlocks even less ability power you get the gold to buy some AP yourself in the end of being better but we'll see those game plays out you think of what you want to non-stop you get free off the turret and you're at exactly and I think it's a supermassive dependent you know you can shove them in your this is something where you can be forming a gold off of the turret you're not a list it can be very difficult to all in as it's not elect elect your jugular is down here so you may be able to come to Farm off of that knowledge every time he's looking for at Argonne stack and some other with the really difficult matchup can often be rain vs range for a lot swear if you're fighting us something safe like a stone or whatever is going to win those trades you can't always even afford and walk up in and get those filthy frogzz as we have seen in the past and 9.11 which is no longer the current life. So the seventh rise wework not yet in play here in this games with the old version for the edl Damon does about stopping a thing much Silas anymore after the patches nurse a coming through and it was this make out of B those last week we really are seeing the champion in Pro for a while it has been such a huge Mainstay of these professional players are just so good being able to not only used in the ultimate feeling but also this way if they're which is really what was targeted and of course I still see us in this game and got pretty close on Farm Jensen waves is aggressive word for today at 4 with the ways being pushed able to walk up there was a very very good drink at Ward at slots blue and bronze especially if it's ever read side start the opposing jungler you can track the rest of that pass no problem you're almost always a Mewtwo getting ganked both of those doing kind of similar past year they did a full clear fracture Scruggs read now going back to their side Smithy did take an early beso to grab the Predator boots so he now is going to have the ability and with those are cool down to build it for some sort of a play but it looks like you did to do the get back out on the map and I'm just going to go to use that for a little bit of additional power in the room the game where it's important it's likely just going to be doing it since we're into scuttled face and make his first by and then look for some sort of a gank and it kind of has been more santorin Style this what I would say is it's going to be heavily prioritizing Farm not always going for this early level gank even on that at least game against get them when he was paired up with Viber Griffin know he was sitting at it level 7 without even really having attempted Yanks doing I was very comfortable just before we get out but this time he's trying to use in fog of War right now so here really nicely done there but not able to avoid the On The Other Side by Paul Belcher afterwards really good deed you change from them and that is such a good to start your Boris and Horton who did get the power Farm out five Camp, Smith there is a Flash not able to get away from stand for in the phrase Deeds are finishing him off before pobelter would have potentially gone down to that church. It really heads up stuff for me to get to capture or the Spire but I do a lot of far maybe if farts the drive time to krog so get some Vision dad has to leave right away but is able to run around himself so 600 gold Princess Beatrice play actually favors of the Caitlin Lucks Lane simply because if you do not have hundreds year old killed very difficult on the side of his Nautilus Daya so that ignite has been used and we'll see if it's a Hill Lane can continue to keep them shoved in the CSO in that regard so no major advantages in that way and it is keffe taken by turtles so he's going to be the one who can actually TV back to this Lane and try to keep it fresher just as kind of sauces Outlook post play so far out on Vision maybe I should be afraid of wrecked by applying very far from the turret and oh 78204 saint torrent a beautiful died there from flyquest bring up a nautilus Pearl is going for a reset he went back to Baton I think that's yellow is going to assume he's going to reset at the same time as his 80 there but Turtle teepees backhoe fought Lane JJ shows up mid the collapse from fly flights coming in from either side of her this is a flashes rise really nothing did you escape the through that can you play quite defensively for the knocked up the past of Auto 2 Chainz coming in from pobelter that is another easy kill and just his way down already and it's going to be quite behind as far as experiences down 12 CS also and he is going to be a target for these repeat gang because still there is the flash available on pobelter relate to your coming out with the flowers back and overall one time fee fee of course is already on cool down so a slow Road up for the PM liquid Midland air is like my stocks that are back in the jungle and 2 and 1/2 camps compared with 50 has but I will take that every time for to fill to get to gold up five hundred bucks please Midler has 600 goals there the plate of course he's pissed both those things he'll think he's an early start hearing you mention Rex I earn those Central in previously this year has been a bit of a farmer has been great so far I think that is critical Force like I suggested he was so damn good for them in Spring and getting yourself this sort of an early lead on racks I really can't believe in a great position the snowfall the game do your Champion that not only do you have the early success if you get those kills in the early minutes of this game you could be one be wanting Solo laners in the midday and you're also incredibly powerful tool if you do get that early Warrior completion he's really on face
