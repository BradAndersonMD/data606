will win every time I mean I called it from the start they would lose a lot of gays respective winners Avicii met at MSI fanatical one that matchup 221 including a tiebreaker right here and we'll see what happens is a V8 Trucks Band away so I could play that one smart but this is also a guy who is pretty fertile and I wouldn't be surprised to see him no leaning forward living like a kindred even though we haven't seen her bring it out since about to just yet but he hasplay benefit of the Caribbean in the pass it is very strong Nocturne another strong one and you can see the respect ban on that cap Joshua was really good on it at a knocking heading 99% presents rather exactly one game it wasn't anybody got that one first until he's going to flex the jungle met here for Natick exactly is Zoe still open as well wrapped by Pogooh well, I would think to do when when you are facing at the Nocturne you have to be very careful about what the toppling match-up is impact is able to get a fully talk later or something feel like even like a red-necked in very very difficult actually survived the dive against that sort of play style and Lulu here would be enough Joey a truck before yesterday and I'm 14 already bad neighbors on this very very strong pics Aaliyah Aaliyah certainly it is a possibility but we also have to remember that that was one of the only came exactly have significant nerves on this path was nerfed I'm across the board took some hits on most of her abilities of Italy is a very powerful accoutred Matt dubb it is open right away from himI like to hear recently over in the panties Rift Rivals man it sucks cuz we can either way I'm so ashamed Nocturne not a big surprise right there good backline fax it to get protection for devil if he's in play mostly Marksman out some of those counters to it I talked about how you have to be very careful about those Top Lane matchups especially with Nocturne to be thrown in there as well as he could be enough to Darius you could ban out something like the Renekton also can't believe Mundo early on and really leave Mundo and in a relatively Safe 1 V1 and I hope he's not going to be afraid on them by the North duringturn on the fan from being a team that you don't want to deal with it if it's against things about the kid that they do make a big difference between the average person just picking it up in the people who really have put in the games at him after the champion Lucian taken away from Dublin missing in the band Fates certainly is a possibility you do you always have to worry if U R T L picking I figure they become extremely magic damage Focus anytime you do is against heavy magic damage you can becomedosage of the back of car that uses of snow were champion and if you are really hairy brutes are comps like Vladimir coming and I'm not a bit surprised with all day if you can't already be banned I was going to say and I wouldn't mind something like that it has in the past and I do have no concerns for Team Liquid and they're damaged profile will see if it's going to be 10 to 4 physical damage if you drop something like a Jeep make a quite a lot of dancing in fact you can't even go for klepto antenna Farm off the window at the Apollo great hope from this very specific and apparel so it's a good worldtake them down pretty quickly but it's going to be some big fifteen52 Me to the Moon. Offensively Top Lane tier cuz it cost 1 man half the people can get flu text you and how I'm being a potential Austin like her and we know it's really hard if you fall behind with a lot of beer and the Alice are flying into the backline Alistar can actually camp that damage coming from the cast in if you are trying to break down someone like the Zoesaid I always look at competitions like this if you have some concerns for what does it look like if you start to fall behind what does it look like a jungle 3 will not be enough though I do think still might come down to the early came here to shake hands and I know you guys talked about a little bit ago the chance of going through the liquid diet and even though the fanatic Squad is triple Major the only hard tank is supports bent out of spite a big old damaged pipe, for fanatic on someone like 50 why can pack you can see birthday present early lock it and leave her to think on all the way so they can get pretty effective with their gold but it will not be no kind of losing Factor really thereinfant help Mundo who just blasted everything in the grocery fleezus we are on new summoner's Rift and your apartheid two and two in the group States if you win the group stage near the end of the day you get basic counterpick of team in the extended best-of-five that takes place tomorrow to look at a frenetic winners face off at MSI Fanatic in the head in that matchup in here is the chance of rain for North America on 212 to be too so they had the advantage in that pic and Anna with that they got the first pick Nocturne so I was kind of like to look at that and track how effective is a champion going to be no did that it didn't really pay off and on 1606 we can start brushing it properly I think another smart thing about the Capitain specific acetone like knocked and if you're not too scared of his early games by the time he is level 6 you already have it on a castle so I can use that to escaped into that first game I'd also really like to highlight that this is Rune and items that appear for caps he went Fleet footwork resolved so about as effective as you can possibly be as well to doran's Shield start so you saying yes is always early Lane will be poking me will be harassing me completely but with the set-up you have the best possible chance of actually listening through that surviving in the early stages and getting to level 6 where you can start really fight back answer to really take over so it's up sacrificing optimal damage later on but you don't really need that it happens if you get too late game it doesn't matter you're going to be a big threat what is very interesting actually had some kind of decent starts with their want to go to point out his fanatical she still lay their edges the bottom Lane maybe hoping they can lie about where they least in those delay or not approach me to did Lee surrender 7 - come too late as well the following trade comes through and really equal to the approximate already here at level one pretty close though I'm going to be here comes not going to run it back why is Star from Team Liquid in the Midland Landing to sleep that's an easy first and then there were in the tray for ottoman volume level one at the moment I'm not a great soft rains there and you know we've seen this a lot do people not respecting level two male but here it is again to Sleepy bubble trouble setting up Smitty's in position flashes rate in Folsom in accident was no damage coming from him until we both could maybe just kept running away from the store but you actually wanted to get a hit on all lights to see if you could kill him and then doubles get in range and that was a beautiful time for mole a setting that up at level 1 get the double top roof drops the ignited Marksman looking pretty viable gets really difficult and I don't need you got to steal the Cassidy and you don't have any sort of wave clear will try to get back there is no flashes available so if you can get that one of our brains in the shenton walk away from the brush actually text blast to make sure I ain't beat level 2 skill level to Smith like you're a fashion hear that sang you have no flash on SS but horrible knock back from rocks are completely missing everything and therefore tall was just walks away and you can question why does he actually spend that before the flash combos use Rotella time to guarantee it you know doublelift is without Flash from that level one fight so I definitely can poor execution here in the early call was good to go butler named always risky level 2 cassette should have given you a free kill on to the enemy Kaiser but when you can complete the best place using up looking like a fool no unfortunately foolish for fanatic but we are going to take stock back in this game at 11 hundred gold difference we look across the lane three equivalent in the Top Lane despite the first blood is dismissed so pretty good for a cat's got good farm so far at Sea. To get back to land at some point later on as well and that right now just shut up and looking for their possible opportunity to get out of range telephone supercharger to walk away now this is the first time this would receive broadcast Aaliyah and as so far it's not been great first and then missing everything on the bottom side rough start friend what ball is without his pool right now that are pulled out the nicest way back to Lane he has to walk away and he'll back up cuz he is he's coming again yeah they push up too far they're trying to convey them in 50 is behind whoop glad and I'm going to go in for that she had been his cell if you could be feared or perhaps you can always argue isn't worth its a TV for kill SeaWorld Elsa State won their members and it to get tutored Ortiz a ton of damage on it probably will be worth it now but there is some free time by once again look it up loud how do you spell bored looking for the flight but this is a very fast CC fee actually coming in for fanatic and it was returned it to want to text with Brock Lesnar's running from the jungle down to join the team when people do not expect it and turn it around to the egnyte but now that is a good kind of power play to it overall TL certainly come to head in the play but I think it's it's good to see fanatic being proactive and looking for plays after falling behind morphite level 5 Walking Away controlling for the tri birth control it's still there and looks like it's liquid able to sit on top of that
