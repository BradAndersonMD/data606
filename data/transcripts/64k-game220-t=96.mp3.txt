you still have to make sure that they're playing their absolute best and really performing when it matters so they must have lost to the first time around this place so they have to make this foot and they need to start with a c instead went right play at full power clutch shows up at all today as well. Leonard display it yesterday broken plate it would say has a better game but no really something that that I think he's quite an exciting packing and come popping up in the meta quite a bit yesterdaysee if that makes it any worse than this game is that Ronnie is available easy grab right there an amazing we'll have some good to us a very fast couple of texts are Broken Blade having a laugh as a trois and gragas you get locked in I wonder if I would grab yasso as a denial even right cuz as soon as the gragas you're thinking. So I'll see you having to make the decision to do we want it or how you want to play that out if you're really expecting something like a Renekton actually can be a pretty good pick. Up alongside has been wanting and very strong in that one you wantthat way to seal a priority right now I want to standard by cops going back to the middle and there's no guarantee that CSM does actually go for the ah so you know you're just thinking that it has it's certainly a possibility you know we have played in this combo play bot Lane we have seen it obviously played mid jungle it is going to be CF so do you also or just yet but then did have one yato game in which they play Dragon Ball that wasn't a lot 40th now but there is still a possibility if it is left up to be picked up later on and don't you have to come here for the most play the champion of the split pic number for for him right now outstripping is it the year in his earlier on in the summer split now September 2nd band phase what we got right now is some disjointed fix note op 1 and 400 no done work sorry no supportpicked up for TSM so we'll see if those us gets try adjusting the clutch band that you were referencing earlier on that was not going to be allowed to just started with that feeling debuff now added to the second part of the Q I can be pretty effective against that a frost also pretty good Mobility wise using Scouts actually died out of those sweet spots to hike then actually coming through here so I guess play Pike this year through a bunch of support bands in and you can do it earlier that you display the gragas gospel bottle and I got to follow along the entire time so that's still going to be thick or not falling for example it wouldn't be that badhey you never know things to do around will be another support fan it will it even matter if I can just pick another band so they are not expecting that you got to go by at least just Seattle or perhaps you know daring PSM to actually go for it so like Dipper X Kenshin completely normal. Like just play it would be fine with Sony bandeau targeted towards bottom Lane with all these before I send everything that we may end up with such standard meta pics of regardless but thieves now going to be having their choices year as far as a d and top to round out their composition I'd like to say will actually be the Renekton it looks like the air for fake off-white good Renekton is a fairly good matchup and if there were any the crazy things happening is going to be a fairly standard match as I can reallyplay well against anything else things yeah for sale in dispatch got the healing added to the most pristine about lamp it going to come through so I know they have been more kind of like all right you do your own thing you survive but it does feel like that would be the best place to go as far as a gangster and Lee Nautilus going to be the lock that will be gragas jungle for Acadian Nautilus and silver as their bottle liners and that is a lot of engage cancel their silver altimate rag that has been passed the engage Nautilus point-and-click ultimate that is going to be really strong there isand it feels like you know that this plan is going to be more like a 1-3-1 style for CSM Fred the map using your GF using you're a rotten and have is going to three man squad that has a lot of strong what is there anywhere I feel much more like this is a group 5 looked at the bifrost edge won't even acted really strong frontliners and some good bass line access from there to Carries On The Corgi in the air through the air is be back in a very aggressive of the map of Destiny an earth movement on the outsidewhen behind a playoff bye Toby get back that level of Excellence their fans back to the same as advanced as well let's get in the game of Thieves vs TSM and funny enough Acadian immediately as they loaded summoner's Rift pinging ocean Dragon spawns in at 4:57 so I certainly could be a big Target there any time it is a first dragon ocean you often want to play around that bottom side you want to be fine for that Dragon because you can get you know that five six minute ocean you're too being such an incredibly strong spot for the remainder of that laning phase do the teams may have to kind of change up their planet in Decatur what they wanted to do that I will have to be early game amazing did start with a very quick sweeper instead of the standard warning totem then most of the bills put down so we'll see if that gets wedding this ismap of the beers and played yesterday smoothie in his interview afterwards I kind of said hey things went wrong around Midland that's why the game was so hard for us and he was referencing the 2 V2 static AV embarrassing I did lose know where Mike young you came in on with your lease and they got a couple kills above your since spent really the rest of that game sitting under terrific getting pushed in on stopping it will see if piercing can make a match up with different today because he certainly was on the receiving end you know down heavily and Farm Walk under his trade him and wasn't really able to make the roomsand we are into this one with no crazy how to get to the early game not even towards slept out by amazing sweet person no extra games here is anyone else going to feel pretty gospel to get to the lands with no major issues looks like a leashless start for a Canadian on the Raptors but under these are going to help an amazing over there on the Red Bluff and that'll be pretty nice to him speeding things up a little bit you can also noticed klepto versus klepto there in the mid lanes over you and yours in both going to be taking that ruin in it looking to try to trade I was back and forth back up that additional gold we'll see who's going to get the better of the two in that matchup I'm just lost sitting so far back and forth with no major issues hold to First for real I'm not supposed to lyrics I can't knock him down just yet is now the level 3 full eyes I'm pretty chill start right now but the first place goes to TSM over the bot Lane yeah I do think when you see the ocean Dragon spotting early and you have severe Nautilus going on here expecting to have priority on that certainly is a lane that should be able to push that should be able to catch the cure an advantage down there they are able to shove it all the way up the turret and smoothie get the word on the cross so they know. Like the amazing is doing a full body side so that is quite a bit of information gleaned from the fact that they had that bush and get that one for you music and then kind of Killeen okay everything's going to be topside now for 3 minutes till you know about 3:45 or so in the game so now it's going to be Broken Blade up to be respectful of what amazing might do and it's it's not even that totally know that was gained they can see the Nautilus leave Lane but I don't know for sure what's going on but again is the point was given Brooklake should know he could be attacked now they should expect as many cops died and he is under throat and should not play aggressively here fairly careful there is no cry do before meeting at the energem go but if I broke my checks this nice for what they're just take that from him they're looking for this off the wave sew a lot of this yet it is a nice little move I do think I'm amazing was hoping to be able to get drugs and not going to be able to do so is that had already been taken away but you're going to miss the cannon that was about for range and one bill a nice little bit of gold and also you're not really sure is this a pointy film that pushed you know this is scary to even walk back to if you're getting paid of the Broken Blade will make the move now and luckily for him the meeting has gone back from his jungle so he's going to get the rest of this wave but yeah that is a lot of fun and very early on so 27 of 14 inch vs gold difference 280 right now and you also know that amazing because we saw crimes were down is going to be so far on top side of that so you know that he could still be hanging around that he could be in the river if the wave which is out too far this is certainly a tough position to begin as offline with the dragon down the bottom side you don't have that back up and you're Broken Blade likely will have to get up a lot of Cs as a result you make a choice what's going on here is this going to be playing right now it looks like has to wait around and in case this could have been delayed pressure he's going to be around takes to recall has about nine hundred gold to buy pieces of stuff as roadway. Feels more comfortable and get some really good rating off and pick up yeah that was really nice getting to sweet spots as well as that deathbringer Stans Auto know both feeling and doing additional damage now. Looking for has been great Thou shalt not going to be in danger really at all right now is through the comes back down the lane in a comfortable first TV came through Van Gogh have a Sheen has been blamed pressure as a result is going to try to make amends life miserable if it should be too hard saver basically already has Warhammer gold and was the next wave has BF Sports gold and then you can keep afterwards but then just held it until we actually saw the Hue animation yeah complete Felts field it's only proper play down from Justin and taking a lot of damage there no fault to be had any more of them finally make it back to the wall to go away but outside of as well and now it's Rebecca Lane I cannot do it is a little bit more dangerous if you want to teleport straight back in your dual Lanes will not be there with you but hundred. Then we're both genres actually were spotted on their club by Wards effectively so it definitely has a front chance to do that we already got these they're going to start dragons you know that they know they pushed it back to base. You tell boring bronze back to the dragon are they see Acadian now though it amazing just getting a little bit low so good leaders will be called over here we're going to play running break a little bit as important very low as being somebody wants to pull it out of there for the graph shows up and just know healthbars big enough for amazing they're there but they're going to give you the Casey's and get something more up already so that's just might yeah and if you don't get to go to order at all I mean that was a great job there by TSM on that collapsed but if I have to say I feel like a little bit of mismanagement on the egg or the dragon someone should have helped amazing to tank up that drag Force we could have stayed healthy or stay around reach out there by Broken by Todd and the ultimate and Brooklyn on you he mind game that you correct the heat went backwards the Q cuz he started to run for that was what happened right there as it has burned in this is Spain is now you can see he's got to be careful with the fact that it has the ultimate Advantage now and would have all that additional healing but likewise in a Broken Blade with Rio on this world there is potential for the die if your ultimate or not. A lot of health comes back The Flash in front of the Nautilus hook to the wall beside him there so things went very well here for kids on both sides of escape on the bottom side they got both of the stolen flashes in a failed dive on Broken Blade as well so TSM could be really happy about those last two exchanges imagine winning way and footing topside and the bottling doing better so this is excited I forgot about that flash to sew
