Champion Select the trophy on the line for the North American or European Champions and when their own blue side in the same way they can afford to give it a priority by the guarantee that strong jungle matchup Richmond definitely wear how it all had started Tarik is also going to be banned near it again on the other side here's the nose do natera games will make their way into the finals yet already Elsa with Silas still up and available to look spry about realizing what they need to take from this tournament to add to their own stuffto really make a new Team Liquid and they want to still rely on those team fighting and those drooping towards the mid-game however if they also talked about wanting strong matchups that will allow and enable some early action from a Smithy well big Japanese black alert a collie Silence by Colleen south of course very important as well if you look at say Okay Jensen on D call Hugo can still go to impact I want to cast onto Jensen his akali and efficiency in the first Jensen during the Crusade has struggled on both side of the Mansion I am proud of Jensen and Team Liquid to be able tothe confident that take this again but I am also a bit cautious and some of the learnings and takeaways for Team Liquid the Conqueror Rune change the build change I'll be at those become a factor as theirs has been locked in for G2 and take it away from Team Liquid the timing right now is do they do pestana alrex eye or do they just looked and looked at the Lock in the bot Lane by then there's going to be an answer with this guy on it but if you go to the store just to have something else that is prepared so they decide to walk in that boat by in here and this gives the freedom to choose walking right side cuz I'm a can of course immediately bad guy here in exchange for a strong bottomley match if they know that bottom line will be targeted they will Whittle down doublelift champion pool here to compete with the bottom size because thatis what was exploited in the last game yet there was a level one there was a flash blown but that is where the game was made for the side of Team Liquid in the mid game they can look for G2 often try to split up the map of God and see if there are windows were they can find these tools and full control of the game I hear of course you got decent jungle pics would you two can keep Banning away junk has one side to look at a force can start pushing way supports for Mickey X the other one is we talked about how cracking ankles and stopping those really going to be important ice can do that outside of the Jungle roll with hot shot try to track the wrecks I say okay she's topside we're okay to play aggressive bottom side has to be recalled and put them in and walked over in danger down here and it gives me to play around one of the most annoying thing so it has taken off the boardmy expectations are the less you look to try and grab them did they know right now could be to lasondra even be something alarm I told you about fresh I think it's something that Mickey has play the DS come out during the regular season Pike is another option that he could go for depending on how aggressively they want to play sealed game 5 with Pike in the can and there's a decent chance we see that his magic dust Team Liquid blink and say we want to play that how do you turn will actually come up in this Champions the way what will Team Liquid answer with they have to Blind for impact that could bring up the pike still away I thought it was so effective against the kennet and it's unable to punish the Pike in Lane even with the rain Advantage because pipe with a passport can back off fuel up and pipehas an all-in threat to the Bone skewer as well as the mobility of the champion well part of what helps G to win that match up is a lot of pressure and a lot of skanks from the mid length and from the jungle going up there constantly a great earlier from G2 Esports is there counterfeit into range matchups and it's a lot of pressure from asking me about Champion Select throughout yesterday and my number one responds so much for the versatility of this team but you know the gold-bearing later on becomes a factor of the executed such a big part when you cough up with other possible sources of first damagejust have a funny story for you I was talking to make you this morning I was like is today the day you get to prove you're the best player on the team he's like I hope so I really hope you can see right now is I'm fine as long as I get to play another hook champion in the threshing we spoke about take the tension on the side of Team Liquid there is so much Mobility who potential potential rather on the side of this be truthful as well.all right pressure is on for game two of us who if I was North America versus Europe in the seven split they've been in Europe most dominant team of Europe the last three and a half years that is unquestionable and it could bring home yours first trophy since 2011 due to its is the new run for them seem like we were built for this game to European continent right now free throw looking at this bike seesaw game one day I feeling excited and then looking forward to seeing what they can do up against Team Liquid who have tried to attack coming as a game so I do think they should be hyped lineup batting cap perks the captain of the team willing to change lanes and they still find success take a look at the invade do Olaf alwaysgives you priority with the Axeman that combined with Brom is basically a win in a level one Skirmish so we're trying to take looks here while on the top side of your math U see two members of Team Liquid trying to cover that pixel brush and dispersed a little bit late trying to match the early aggression that G2 demonstrated last game but she to ask you showing a lot of respect staying in darkness trying to avoid all of the vision so that his starting point is unknown to expanded yeah recognizing the fact and Olaf on the enemy team with most other iOS Vale as well as incredibly powerful as far as level one they know they have no place to testing it so they don't get themselves into a dangerous spot looked over the jugular two-year-old you may not have seen him quite a while probably should have been easily clear for himself are we start here on the Raptor camper as you can see what the Talisman start no problemwhat alarm is on the right side and she started on his blue immediately transferring into the Grump which means that he should have information on way to get enemy jungler is now because pokes and Mickey came to light a lane rather late you'll also notice that Jensen is actually adapted cappza's akali build going full the Conqueror and likely picking up the Landry's later on so that when they move off to a side length of the account become an extended trip for those things we touched on learning from your opponents and see what was victory over the wedding world champions IG Benson walks in Lux into the Zoe matchup learning from the North American LCS finals yet again here at the hands of caps learning from the akali side of the Silas monchi and you can hear from just more than us as shocktober G tooz coach after the draft reportI just got a chance to catch up with Gtunes coach a grab that I forgot them about team morale obviously I forgave Lonnie said it's the same as before we're not getting overheated we were confident and we still are and of course ask him about the pike pick once again I ask him is it's not just going to be the standard for you guys you said no it's still very situational and in this case it just works out very well. 80 Carey has no dash so it is a perfect pick them also what he found about thiel's composition he said well nothing to be surprised by this is a typical Team Liquid composition and if they don't get to leave early they don't win the game so he's feeling pretty confident about this oneEncompass the bottom line is double shutdown a 200 hp do flight attendants rest for Yanko could go for big Floyd Another flag Pin Oak Court JJ II First Blood match beautiful landed by Mickey to set up the play on to double if absolutely beautiful execution that she to boost blood once again it may be questioned to the best pike on the team is but no question who the best threats on the team is Mickey again getting a lead on the bottom side of the map for G2 is the one that picked up the first blood on this wreck site everyone knows how devastating is Champion can be a now he's looking to release some pressure meancomes out and forced out by Captain like a parent to get sticky and it landed here we see keep your eyes on Mickey and notice how he goes in between the minions just as it dies double is past the wrong way he gets hooked underneath the Panic why he doesn't take a towel shock the damage is already done which means that he's supposed to flash early and then call JJ has to give up his life so that his 80 calorie can survive but that's three out of. Bojangles to look for potential flight once again ball thing as wellwhat did you do my quit looking at jankovsky flash live in chest pain is on the board but now it's restored your day you will be shut down as well as you answer back on the akali one kill for silence on the situation jail new expected while the display to come out they had three people all the moving towards midline position and they knew that the rights I have no class cuz he was the immediate so they were able to come out on top in expecting with you I've looked Hooks and I text remember that extra bit of damage enables you to defend it into one another look at it and it goes on the right side still staying underground so he does get the Ping to Sea-Tac Smithy and corded are arriving before JJ makes the dash in to start the action here and in which RV Cleburne onyango ticket the first killthat's correct. It doesn't have a flash because he went bottom side and killed the prom taking the Brahms flash as well before JJ also no way out of the fight and mid laners both get killed and noticed Mickey did not use his Lantern she try and save Yanko she made the decision in the moment to try and bring put into the fight they realized my jungle or is already gone rather than try and save him lights redeem the situation by there if you want to point out that Justin has yet to back he still holding on to his teleport Landing as long as he can for a later bigger power Spike there is finally item coming through that is a Cutlass and if he has better item so far is Mid length and despite the extra kill for G2 because of a cannon on the top side with klepto you can see the Team Liquid actually slightly more gold still a lot of it and Spacall Matt Kennon match up though I know what's interesting here is that yesterday when we Wonder playing his bike into Conn's 10 and it was actually surprisingly even I think a part of that was Tom wasn't familiar or used to the match up with the cannon into pipe here we seeing a lot more confident play from the side of impact not only does that show his confidence on the tenant but it also shows that he's been paying a lot of attention to how one that plays despite these or somewhere where the Jungle the tension is going he knows a lot of folks around the outside of map to become book to play aggressiveBlue Cross Lanes right now it's Cheerleading full across-the-board the first blood for Yanko Santa's do bikes with these extra Farm being Olaf most is Goldie 40 L is in the top Lane this almost 23s lead for impact expected base the match up again the way it flips is getting pressure from your other teammates and I'll be washed and Jensen fight off back and forth and he steals you walked away in the wings here threatening to turn that one V one upside down and kept back off right close to you can see the break point for this Silas vs. akali Matthew once you get the gunblade in particular when she gets that Leandra said she'll be in a much better position but in the interim with cats having that level six and having a couple more items under his belt is coming out of head in a lot of these folks right opportunity to die of a little bit into those adjustments that cat showed in this matchup that sentence will probably be learning from you know they are game is over time adjustment
