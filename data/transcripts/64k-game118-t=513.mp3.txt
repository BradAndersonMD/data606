both these guys are standout players on their damn I have been pretty impressive closer throughout the split I do think both of them have the ability to get an aggressive early but closer it's usually the one to do it more often so I think in this game it's more'n santorin to contain closer and closer to be the proactive player to try to get some these Lanes what you may expect to lose and isolation ahead we'll have two teams hit Champion Select the first Target for Golden Guardians is that work on and ignore trying to remove some of his engage opportunity but with that like you to hand it over to a casters to take off art or not maybe I'm going to hold just been informed that we are restarting Champion Select by a producer so we're going to hold here on the anal sex or just another moment felis and let the teams get reset in the Champion Select don't have a jack word on what went wrong there Morpheus outfit by the waysounds good see what I was doing and where we need glasses I don't have those I don't have is the morphe that he actually doesn't wear just black he has a it's a purple shirt and a green tie it up but they going to let you know if you can you can build the pot that these are good foundation some good building blocks you establish to becoming very much a sew-in in that wardrobe for the at home broadcast you don't need me last week he is Morpheus it up this time around. I've never seen swear I have an outside yet you have not I'm impressed man or did your girlfriend give it to you this is the family like Christmas tradition that the zimmermans is my momgive me some like ridiculous amount of sweaters I probably have thrown out dozens of sweaters she's getting ready in this town right now Mark what do you want to do because I love alive heart back up onto my screen with Patrick on been hitting the table all wait for the ACT will go ahead and toss it over the cats but I want to get your opinions real quick on the way the Champs like developing fat Target towards the rakan in a Pantheon to follow through what do you think of golden Guardians attack plan so farit does seem to me like they are trying to limit a lot of flak West easiest engaged option so like if they are going to go for a heavy pushing bottle and they have other things in smoothies to leave if it's not the ziggs pantheon with one of your biggest concerns about being able to Stanley jump onto them from from anywhere on the map is supposed to work on starting things off though it could be telegraphing some some more bot Lane aggressive fix think the band is actually really smart because the FBI has been spamming the champion his free trade games on it has look good in all those games so removing that as an option makes a lot of sense taking way too fly Quest is but the first band phase I am going to hand it over to the cap is officially that first game of the daythat's right dash it is my time to shine hello everyone in the welcome separated by The Last Jedi standing death by the way so what level are there talking about eating are in the various before that he's played by far his most played of all the different Champion so he's the rakan and easy engaged at very clearly something golden Guardians have focused on here then one of the first pick of belly looks like so many other teams in that if you have very quick engages and easy Duns & Fifi I can compete in a gated very quickly but it was FBI special Champions champions in The Meta who protected him a little bit and they've got themmanatts work ethic anymore I expect to see the pic rate decline over time for now though teams account for playing any certainly viable don't get me wrong to be working here but to be honest and that they've been the dearest thing no affiliation up here at the pic I'm curious of what they expect to counteract this with fine with them now while the MF is a very strong later as well if you can get the correct double up there so I do like we're wild turtle as like with the boxes for the course they do have viper in this is one of the big story for the match that got him Renekton already it is other team a flexible Champion I would say it's not really going to be a power of evil Champion but he has proven us wrong on other assumptions that we made about him so I could very well be moved around still passhas played Mala Chambers but they've been Diana Rumble and Tiana they've been traditional mid laners as far as I'm concerned like looking at at the end of History right now so yeah Renekton having is going to be a rally up but that's the weather right now again not going to go do something like that but they do nose do is the mid lane so I'm curious what they do answer with lot of attack damage I'll look at 6did you get here look at your big bird kill enough has the Super long-range yeah surprised Pikachu Toby this is this is the most surprised Pikachu you're like you know other teams play with black rim so I don't think this is any sort of crazy thing from like what they're taking it very seriously they know that they need them into this game to try and lock one of those top spot in second place very important for playoffs and with him on the road exit with a blade of the ruined King bucks this is where the first Champions I thought of as causes cluster their play the road king with your empowered W absolutely yeah I think he's definitely very good and I am through see what happens because I agree with what if there was saying was that solo has been playing well I think he's been a pretty dominant player right wrong that Arthur has been good they have to do First Blood match 3 games display and it said yeah you replace wiper going to keep this guy if they can flexes to top laners that's pretty Rhythm band I didn't go for it anyway they put them on something more conventional I think if I should expect wristbands down the line is going to prove it here on non ribbon and that is I think the good choice for testing the water tubing to the know which which of the two actually want to bring Dairy out of the draft now fly by Celine jungle are cold and Guardians the same as I've got a mid laner a top laner and robot Lee yeah and the Alistar the engaged for ignorance still come just in a different form here out there hasn't been super popular recently but don't have a lot of good luck to you need to put a little bit more effort into your vision control because I'll start does the media lights blinks a little bit more than Raton didn't have to think that we're gone as well just needs to be used on the golden Guardian side and it's the early game jungler for closer isn't very well with getting leads for the team on Earth Gang compilations are excise app and. First flood at level 1 to toppling was really strong overall I I'd like is it feels pretty Uncle parade the back teeth bite from forest kind of hitting people in in fashion basement gutter Alfred to get Bosco Paxico he's feeling cool down to the passive is a lot shorter so we'll see him sustained ocean stealth and it's a bit more easily in lane and orange yeah and the trundle is a really funny because santorin after he came yesterday tweeted out zero practice games on trend of zeros trim King struggle but he got the wind are the other stage they're so good to go for Round 2 found success the song Champion trundle is very good I think there's not that many to self don't like me to throw up a pill and be like yeah I think pretty solid can guarantee exactly seconds be with the wind golden Guardians must win and get help for a chance at making playoff the stakes couldn't be higher for these two teams will see here after 5 medical pet him take a break with the game hello everyone and welcome back to the show
