series the regional qualifier has been a 308 230 into about to be a 308 out here if possible happen Kobe and these teams have been playing very close I would take it. Letra series have been a 2-0 where is the other ones felt like Stomps on a big TSM are within their right to make it back here goldenglue in this out of this is their time to pull out all of the stops they have have to make it happen here or there season end the first that would be gets emptied an endingearly today never have this much time on their hands as the evolved irelia up and available back to to Jungle Band towards Greg I want to see if they said you wanting us a fun fact about great getting engaged I agree session has been Champion I want to be picked up in the first phase because there is no gas to help with the hard dive another new compound C9 side really good band from adjusting to what cloud 9 have been doing even though they are leaving up another option for bladder price lacks on his way and Camille I think the protection is something that is more important there are not a lot of options for protecting divers as much as there are options for divers themselveswell we're Conga music. Zion seems likely you can wait on that pic of course I can go a little bit later aatrox the champion has looked good but it's been both games despite Blanco size that matchup but I am again. What year I didn't grab that are leaving up they can grab some more their diversion none of that Galia these offenses pics but I'm curious to see what will be there galio replacement what will be their binding of defense for these divers if they match up that he just had with HaunterI really expect to see is that I am here because I think she does work very well in those diving beans Delta kite things like there are champions I can work that aren't I have it that's the pic here we expect HR stop playing as you mentioned before the draft is still a flexible Champion but I expect he is sent to pick a jungle in mid next phase but I will probably be banned in response to that I need a mid laner and a flexible top done with on the mid lane or if they continue to whittle down on possible jungle Champion pools to force it into a more often. Wayne and that's actually what it looks like it's going to be they want to force it. Once again not going to wait is getting rid of a C9 diabox Davy make him forced to more conventional situation but of course I do so much damage that might be hard yeah I meanplay more options the Camille is another one obviously that was very successful for pliable flapper first time around but there's your Aralia not going to be on the table this time around 4. I really am curious what comes through so many just curious what face threatening, for the other team would consider is domestic Camille 242 Kobe beautiful stuff on this one will ever again be like Grey's but that is 3 a back road on Waze off the table and gave him and I grew on figure he's off that would leave the option if however trundle has been the target of some nerves recently and they started to whittle away at his power we've seen a lot of teams be okay with that trades and not quite so scared of the interaction where sidhwani with her passive as last night's early on and then once you use your Aftershock as well you basically pecan stats if the timing is correct and you use your ultimate for a 220 will then drop down very far is a negative resistance is in a liar team is better be not going for more conventional to cancel Universal Champion 250R on but it's not the same as what galio does and are going to go for a Hoveround the trundle as well what kind of texture are we looking for is benign side and then again that Hector is flexible it's happening every possible they could fly a viable option to go for Tilly and the jungle hecarim States top I do believe all right this is going to be very very snowball here to Leah still has so much even though he was at the very beginning of her peak in the jungle roll are they taking a lot of cool down pretty much down on her take it down is it as explosive and it does take a couple of levels for deleted to get back to her previous power-wise route to set you up that would be one of the things I'd be looking at the other thing is bottom line is a very big possibility was basil back on Alistar okay career playing a mage the backside will be can play the team fights well or I coming back in for beardson and it began a giant Frontline if you want to consider ergot melee and rakan Bailey than its again for Freightliner is a desire and it is not often stated when it comes from the jungle roll useful in pulling off power dive in corralling enemy jungle as far as the wall that you can create with it to make people get hit by the head from Ultimate or make people be on the wrong side of your rise realm War ultimate for themselves to use to be interesting to see if they can combine those things like the rise and filia ultimate to pull off those place cuz that's what you like to see in professional play take it to another level through those creative use of facilities and finds aggressive plays again but it's not the same kind of diabetes in for Saint Cloud Nine to give us a new look to see if they want to complete that sweep or if he isn't can reverse their fortunes and win 3 straight we are on this could be the last North American LCS game of 2018 csm's Back Against The Wall we are back on the wrist now Cloud Nine with three people who were rookies this year to make their way back towards world now what an incredible journey for these guys working still hard in the academy leaves Cloud 9 putting more Focus than almost any other team on the academy roster and it paid off so big for them this year they've needed them the most they were able to dig from their Academy team and find success in the LCS as well Cloud 9 has been I would say North America's most successful organization in global competition they have only failed to make top 8 Once back in 2015 but 2013 14 16 17 they all made out of groups or Auto qualified CNN have been a good show at world it would 701 play in the last time and if they wouldn't hear their back to play in the world 2018 this year has not been they won Academy playoffs they won Academy World physically and they made it to the finals in the ALCS meanwhile do DSM they have to win now they need all of their fans behind them their season 2 has been so Rocky all culminates in this point they need to win back-to-back-to-back reverse sweep if they want to keep it going Red Sox going to go down towards the cross the different food now for Greg is going for more a weak base klear got the Raptors in his sights is Gary Sanchez has been made and so far for him perfect PS not much of a surprise for knocking at the door. Vincent with the same honor Heroes they're going to push back and forth unspoiled in the top side but he was last seen flying to decompress as well Benton family. Both of them so they break takes over bottom Scuttle crab does walk over toward the blabber should know that top Scuttle will be his option will be open was finished up with the Raptors first we can head up there after is pushing in on the top side but liquor should be able to support him well enough to grab that scuttled before they get back over to the side of map that's the whole point of all these early River Wards every single game both teams play multiple words in the River ski the first trans we're getting down to the shuttle so that they don't get CC but if no one's coming around him at all so for cancer peace now for the dog loose then because top said he can try to fight a truck that's why it's it looks for those cruggs up their remember ignite is the Summoner sell for hectogram he's going in now so you know it could be some damage response or can I get the push to look good for if you find that you can be dangerous and just barely besides McDonald's and it is a long cool down but had a charge available this job there by answered not having to use any Dumber spell truly on the early stages of a match point game are so text her we want to be the first one to make a mistake we going on here immediately pops p e r us back cuz I don't wanna be part of this one a couple CS but break his back out of an app available resources for why you wants to take stool many potion and go inspiration secondary is both of the health regen but also in large part with the biscuits and corrupting potion replacing your man if he can spam York you usually for a gangster or counter and he's going to go at off of recalls talk to me is to teleport back to Lane going to just use a key for the Speed Charge trying to get back there to Hunter and climbing PS4 right now with licorice David heliport for a possible crossmap play now pushing back over and I pay only about three CS with lots of fun that Rico want to lose out on this PS4 factor that lane you're exposed to an enemy jungle repeat gang choose between bad situations are EPK or losing out on some CVS licorice does not play the 3D games but that means that haunts her now has the big wave looked up go CPS Workshop payments again battling a little bit away from the heck is there he is actually Power of Positive vs. Sophia Greek in this video I'm not quite sure what the communication was like if he thought that gray could join a bit sooner because if Greg would also commit someone can get over and apply that would be enough sense to know what the heck run has not Lain with flash she's got her tight so it is possible go for those early all Lanes but because there's no extra support the Chris gets away with it since deactivation and we talked about how much the same as got in biscuits corrupting potion and he said he'll back up a small portion that probably be extra, get graviton that really recall that damage wasn't knocked out getaway dying at the tower allows Hunter to level up is opened a time it out out and he had them out to Better Health now looks like it's not going to be a diaper happens lyrics to no taking it right to him make I keep on your toes there for some running around to your screen door in southeast he hasn't been a huge player in the of but they do know that this is where the play is going to be made these are on the Alistar headed back to Lansing pretty quickly there you be a top psychic
