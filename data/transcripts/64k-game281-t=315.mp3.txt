can I become the the player we look at now is a he's an innovator he's flying kind of whatever he wants like he has one of the only playlist wins and definitely showing that they have style and plus I'm kind of getting on on the other side I think you certainly it felt like they had found their brought it in the house they want to play which is very clearly. Thank you and then you have the powerful carry in the middle and in the bottom line is that is kind of the salad at the Dalton where they had found almost all of their win when they have strayed from that they have not really been getting any win the three of their for Windsor with Sion the other is with her got all playing that sort of file I do think that's a job in that we saw darshan bring out yesterday and fit that style is well and he was waiting quite effectively against Broken Blade in a bad matchup so maybe we'll get another shot at seeing darshan on that picmeanwhile the tried-and-true biofrost Tom Kent will not be allowed here is got five plays at other Windsor on that champion imagine this last game as he is certainly it's a viable option here but it will be CLG also continue the trend of Andalusian even though it did not win earlier today if I do a certain point if something has her over band but it's offline and Instagrams and then you're bending it not even because you're you know it was wrong anymore because you haven't full and you have a right to your no longer sure exactly how to play against it or one that says do what I'm doing but I think I make a lot of sense when Force the LG content Azrael combo has been so effective revealed you as well in that late-game really picked it was Untouchable with that and they are going to break out in early galio the certainly could be thisportugalia that we talked about yesterday really get to see anything from it because the lane face went so bad but this is a trend. Clean to go to the ER got but as in almost all York matchup that just depends on how many times you actually connecting with Yorkie you need to focus on getting fools out when you're fools are out Champions can fight you if you're able to connect with that then you can go in and continue the trade-in to try to get pretty aggressive and this can get more and more your favorite especially post this when you have the ultimate because the first effective on the air. Dash can't go over walls he's downright XO so there is some decent stuff that you forgot has the dad does not Escape things like that would have come out later on a draft for the Yorkand first one always Target itself is wrapped up as he probably picked down there with Lucien and Ezreal off the table we have free sneaky and slick back in the draft so just yet but again this is a champion the candy apple Eton Lane at 10 to have a very weak laning phase are we having a lot of sport utility base text in the support role for they tend to be very effective in 2 weeks Landing opponents then we'll go to that when they do with a stipper might be kind of hand thank you for farm for my instinct is to respect me wrong that file Frost Gallia will notyou'll haunt you can react almost every single spell Galileo. It's not too bad just going to play it but it's 9 we go to the second round of or did they second phase of Vans and LeBlanc has banned by Theo James Bowie Band by Cloud Nine starting some of the state line pics I didn't make a lot of sense you're going to force me to ask you to try to show his hand and then very likely if he giving power people counterpick see where they want to try to go with that quirky is available we did just see that come out and I think it is a very reasonable blind think that's going to seem that is very physical damage heavy right now with your. And it's never expect you to be magic damage but obviously Gophers Oriana or even at Sindra those are both available within fairly safemiss that are being removed way here or not you're supposed to be some galio delivery right now coz can't pick up an octopus jar but he's still up that Urich still put the Jarvan top play for some reason either way you can put carbon jungle obviously desperate acts like a Corky Med for even you know that also works pretty well with the people in the cave I know it's very easy to hate your knocked up out of that was certainly someone who could help to try to put your head I do think in general anytime you're playing York I think a lot of your game plan to do revolving around enable in New York because it's Champion is so strong from ahead if you can get access to toilets if you can win Monday one survival and we do stuff you really can start to take over a game and knocked down her so incredibly fast and went behind Goreis an abysmal Fang fighter and I'm not sure if that is going to be the call but certainly there is par for fuel weed to pick what he wants because he doesn't necessarily know for sure where is he going to go well it's going to give us our sobrero here with an oriental pick up and it works well with their right you know Jarvis a going in with you or your combo off of that this feels like it a lot of fizzy mix a lot of things together yet essentially the Jarvan and the galley of both as far as hard and gays but also the galley of can get out and help the door can the Garmin gank they're very well you have strong engage of scaling in the form of the time for the team fight and stuff but if you can get people for thismake internally Turn Around by itself actually worse I get to whatever you're hitting them assume that follows you around this place they had like a fox. Furley are in the feet is in their hands so far over last year's lackluster run to the ALCS there is certainly light at the end of the tunnel can be very very good season of ornaments drawing it and we have some fun, coming in for us as well Nifty reprising his role on Silas a jumping into that you were going to play take take take with Drew Carey's. We wanted to see and they're doing it here we are see on the side of Cena and how much space would you be able to trade for a sleepy because it's actually triple Aftershock plus there's the Top Lane so these are a lot of Pinkie members here 49ers should be able to create a lot of space for sneaking a deal damage on the Severn that is one of the things that I have felt like sometimes we actually saw 6 a.m. have any trace of a game as well situations where the Timbers at be quite fed but can never get enough damage because they didn't have the safety and a space being created by that front line in is purple after. Members and their graphs determine vehicle who who is playing today I couldn't quite hear thank you coz on the wrist ladies and gentlemen and we've got our push in the mid lane is Pee-wee takes over a brush no word comes down and it still lives we don't cheer for that one should I do I'm sorry I'm sorry forget I said anything about drink 4 words please don't do it meanwhile as we wait for the players to get on the wrist keep mine to have lies off the rift as well after match today Wiggly and darshan be joining me and Kobe on LCS food on a new game show that test darshan Singh Powersports he's really good he is really good you got a YouTube channel covers yep definitely going to be watching what Tritton is feeling really big damage that was a nice start after socks cheap alignments killshot Elaine's eat pretty easy you should be able to pretty reliably Proctor that this is never said we should you really want to be in this New York if you Felicia your phone it doesn't because you really want to have access to the wave to try to get as many graves out as possible I want to take a lot of Frozen movie on his number one Champion I'm making the mistake of his is actually utilizing you're cute too often for trading and not often enough for last hitting for the graves because really your power is all around those schools you are pretty garbage without them that you are very very powerful with themself prioritizing last setting that allows you to be in a position where you can actually fight back fighting back to Scuttle crab can't and wow just spent staring just beating up the fence with animals it's like world quarterfinals all over again shattering spree with me is the first on the treadmill hate me I have no response to that you shouldn't. It's always a really nice early by we can grab Dark Souls tattoo when you are starting corrupting and they're being able to get the added benefit from that increasing the healing you're getting back and early power so utterly base he's not going to miss out on too much and certainly I think he's he's looking to hope they give for 7 to see Stevie but if you have more than halfway there that he shouldn't have to use it here are some decent you want to check in that Top Line is actually the only two CS tracker but you can see darshan. About 10 is so for the liquor supposed to going really really well and that extra pressure is certainly mattering he's got the potion still. Combat pushed out of Lane but he is strictly down ACS it feels like he's trying to hold the wave by his first because he's not actually three graves right there he's not bringing those out so it does lead me to believe he's trying to hold it here for a gank otherwise it is Miss play because it is quite easy. Can we get most of that farm in and compete for that a lot more heavily when you do have the tools out wave enforcer. Mason pushed to his opponent now though so actually fight this so often times Jarvis here and sit when he's not he's reclaiming back to the bottom side this would be an unanswered gank if we pulled the trigger there's a war right now licorice is backing up and he knows he's on condition not be able to try to go for that so now we will likely see him try to read that the way above their and see how this massive really does go because liquor certainly has been doing so much raised from the entire Community from the other top-liners in the league and from the broadcast as well most people again as the number one top laner himself coming out and say he thinks he's the best player in the league right now and you're putting your son of the Edition where he really needs to have a good game and needs to be doing well on this number one player for CLG to likely win all right welfare sean gets the way switch without getting game that's always a tricky one when you like okay I have to walk past the river as make sure I can survive it in about + 7 is a wave resets one more time spent staring for this rake in last 5 minutes so pretty solid however you get the chance of pressure you can see Oriana and jarvin waiting in the wings and saying you can't take this as yet and I think it's important to test right you know this is something that you really can't afford to give over that early ocean Dragon at 5:30 I think is farina way better than any other dragon in the game is as such a huge impact on the remainder of the length of a good spell shield. Liners nice attempt by the board as benign get that better rabbit both have the Q as well delivering pizza straight to your door I can only think about sneaky cosplay whenever he's working to bring the skin that's just a sneaky cosplay skit yeah if he needed any time to apply Gatsby in Lanez proud that was my internal monologue that was different that's good I like this crap yeah thanks all right we're taking application comes in he's got his army now you going to be the reason to push down and around tooth darshan mechanics can he keep the made into live up with healthy connections he'll back Us in the well also
