game one or game too and I think that's like what has really looked on so EG no yes you can do different things and Raph they didn't go to read size like Mark and probably were hoping for to get a good match of our kind of people we want to call it Forge New K so it is going to come down to Kennebec skating game can you be on the same page and replicate some of the best you have in the later end of the split wood got you to that that's actually finish which put you in such a good thought you to be here right and got you the win over flyquest in your previous seriesI will the bands are caught up in some of these teams back way back earlier in plastic was a very big winning part of the opposition but they're out the train at the okay of Hailey's what we want let's grab that now almost feel like you have to take to run alongside it or potentially give it over to spend staring which can do flies a lot of the power of that foreign I don't know if they feel like Spence Karen is even willing to play that one though so they are going to go Calista likely they could just go to class at Eric and play what IDI played in the previous couple games they call Sue eclipse of ROM this is different options their butt and do to solo 10 torrented to Kumo in game one which is grab that sound effectShakira and like grab an early midliner in right now for the hat is so well, with with the callista I make top sport decision bit later now could you sing some very clever as you know maybe also the Crockett stopped at the crucial has been so willing for Spence Quran in playoffs most played in playoffs by far and they looked for the last chance to grab it get it now I like this the more I think about it whatsoever and look pretty pretty everything when when it got those later stages and they weren't able to actually enforce anything or anyone they gave me happen is a playmaker krakus is someone who can engage for you can have her leave gang write honestly with that body trim flashed also at the cast of six can be pretty strongit's going to be tight coming through another aggressive watch it online stay too but goes you on ESPN grnh virtual break we will see you back here for the start of the game I've got them a little bit the fries to the pike into the song catch Tomcats feels like such a strong denial pic but if you feel like you can run that lane Pike is another great room or right I kind of listed pikas is that third Champions on top of the day you know all of those roaming play making supports that ignore is known for a long time, Bliss which are Vans so whether or not it's good for that feels he can get out of plane put you in early make things happen elsewhere that has been a lot of what Blacklist has found success doing there now double Bening topless take away the itch Rock they're trying to force the bluff go for something new for him status of his band out the other two big ones out there for him so I am expecting him just go board top as the answer divorcing yet again I don't really know why I go see the jungle as they are going to keep up their romantic dark and throw down a lot of good and well right Dr norn can really start outside and I do want to know if he what does go for a tough Fighting Champion like the morning goes down to them like I don't know if you are on tank Duty Ghosts no play something like that and I'm curious what does come down as easy as well or just about that that by B5 there as a mordekaiser does has I think a better matchup against tanks but discomfort remaining unbanned it does give very good setup for sincere in on the tracks here to there's a point-and-click Stunna it is now a lane for him to gank because I can't get this and Tom kench really not the best Gangstaz are corgis good middling till farming there but not trying to be paired with the orne and that Pike I think can be quite a nice combo because the orange ultimate layered on top of the Nocturne ultimate can get people low enough to the point where I can go for the xq in 1 Spy Kids 2 reset in those fights and get that for call Mikhail that is so much of a gold injected springboard you into assessment team place of them and nocturnes deal with in those later stages I will say a lot more like an EEG draft than it has throughout most of this series I like those time Kent I am glad Greg is back there for Spence Terence the one small issue I have though is the midline is 3 + 7 all time on his ear it is very low and right pick for him hopefully looks good for him we'll see what happens we are on Match Point welcome back to our ESPN viewers we're going to see if life was close it out but I do like this EG dropped a lot more that they have the tools that they need to take a windsor in game 3 will be interesting to find out if they're going to be able to execute on that because well I do think they have an affair with a comfort that she looking at the gragas and looking at the Barclay and their dad is going to be very nice for them it also can be difficult I think in some ways when when you're looking at just the amount of Frontline damage that like what does have they could have been just wipe front to back you know with whitthorne upgraded items on cork yeah and turtle are they have the ability to play halfway through the side lane to be shut down some of the threat of something like Renekton bushing in that filing because of the Nocturne available there so exactly how does play out but I do think like us there are going to have their chances to and with how well power of evil has been playing he's on another scaling farming champion in the mid lane and you can expect him to be a monster come lay came on the car key all right you would go just ignore scrapped at the very beginning a game for a minute then going to hit your suitcase so far no but sitting around I mean they are probably ignores going to spot us okay hello you are there all right no no harm no foul back we go solo and centaurion again to look for the sweet going to look for the word that's not really doing too much they don't find nothing to kill but they got a very safely start on that side of the map yet again to get that rest up I think it's okay though I'm sure he would have gone for a whole cacao the same set itself I think it was a nod to the fact that he ji 2 games in a row has for that top jungle invade we do with the gripes Renekton and how tight are in the midline up and respond to that incredibly quickly and shut that down so I think he's just saying hey I'm going to spend a little bit of time in this early game to be able to respond to the Moon she has been making a cup times in a row andaz Apna Desh inverse much the Frog really high armor that one now smells like the bottom side table trays. They can do for healthy gains and it's going to be the length of looking to do some of the EG side pushing early on 4th Blackfoot not a hard look like Duo match up junk was a training camps back and forth and so far it's identical to Raptors be a very early on but with DPA and all the consumables there shouldn't be worried about a plant got a lot of pain for sure and he is actually going to do so for those going to short trades Us in traffic around here is a little bit careful but is getting low watch forced out of Keowee he really wanted to pay him interested in touring flash Force away easy For the First Time all series going to go to the game and that's obvious dear this is here is a dominating there in that one big strike me as the end of this wave and the way they can be stacked with the wave is screwed year I did lost a lot of those those are not many ants are there for him to collect it's 21 cf-27 what does that is by I've ever seen of the Corky the duffel do you want to kill me anymore I got a boy something small out right here which is way back like to three years ago when they're all the big 83 changes Riot there for the base Health Region of almost in March for the game except was totally played mid-length so he still has recently High base health regen but if he was sane solution that would be a horrible by cuz Bay Street and solo with both play Anything by then but I'd still rather have the rain going to rebuild it and then you were having to level two floor heat bite into a level 3 is there who already was been helped him and that put him in a situation where he had to fly away then santora and felt like even more of an over fourth where you're coming the situation we feel like we already met. We got to get something back to the centaurian over Jason's not knowing where he's been scaring his and he is divorced so it's definitely a bit of a mess up that was then Amplified by another mistake or they're they're kind of stuck in this sun cost fallacy were like yep today it was easy who played it better so it's 300 gold lead in the very early game protecting push-ups he going quite nicely up against its foreign very good job first thing I see if there is a really hard as Pike fight into a Comcast because if you want to get aggressive at all know if you ever see forward pumpkin she starts hitting you and can devour you ask you and kill you off so that is very very scary for ignorant playing this Pike and means they're going to have to play much more of a defensive game than you would normally want to on this Calista the trade-off obviously is that you have powerful roaming with ignore any open Play Making come in a mid-game if you fight time is going to try to make that worthwhile all right well not a lot of damage don't pop the band and it's not enough to soothe Kate gets two pills early on this is what ET wanted Evil Genius is finally coming alive in this series the first truly big moment it feels like for them of this three-game series just Zuki how have you will really low fear felt like he stick around but he's down a level he's out of Mana did you take goes and takes it down flashes over the wall and has the support of diesel and Spence are to continue this fight and then I think he's just going to kill you you are so squishy on that Pike at this point of the game look at the farm and the killing a monstrous lead for to do K in this early stage of the game beautiful beautiful exactly Valley is on the board for two kills a double to see us as well this is the kind of game that u g can a win will see them get off the finish line but it's obviously a great start it is a really really good start your me GA that can make you feel as a player in this series that hey we can actually do this look at these guys are so good in a little bit of that Swagger that I think he had created for themselves throughout the split and if it's been horrendous Fit Don't rejuv bead on the first death and it's a call on the second that he is so far away from his first completed item was very little power have you boys can be set behind in this game so I would like to see EG start stacking up a new bill start using this mid lane events that you have let's see those early dragons you have pressure in the bottle e2e to you have a massively Manning winning midlane take dragons take referrals start building towards a late-game wind condition now while you're ahead I would like to see if I can get some of the push down to the bottom side of the map I think they've generally had pushed pressure it's also the great for 3 call things had good Farms got the VF store right now in a state look very good for EG top links okay it's bouncing back and forth but can we could still feel very good the mat if it's well right he's got the team at powers like that should feel very very careful for the Renekton yes I would like to see these things come through I don't want to just stop down Play Farm off for 8 minutes and then wait for flight bus to catch back up so CDG could turn up the pressure keep things going on yes I agree completely there should be no reason that you give up first dragon when you are math we had in Midland we had a cracker and Bob Blaine and Jungle Book I want to be concerned that they know Corky's
