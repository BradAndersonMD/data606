but the odds are I'm going 0-16 on Saturday and then 1501 Sunday is 1 and 30 mm but he's done it so far so if we Saturday but yeah if you lose on Saturday he is never lost on Sunday I predict we'll see if it remains true throughout the year is an exciting one though it is teams that are tied in playoff position right now at 3 and 4 when put you up about that cuz as we near the end of the first round robin nine games for the first year for the back half year was We have no trash out loud rock and roll Taco know in this one know what I got for Sunday even talked about in that thought you was talking about me laughing Taco is so effective on the champion and because I do foxes have the most expensive playing through their bottom line of them getting advantages and really being a very very strong for the team epic it makes a lot of sense at Targettake away the Azrael take away the trash so food safety is gone now I think for the fuck to get removed as well certainly full of strong Champion we've already seen bang play and made the bottling before wouldn't feed the price to get in no caste as well pretty funds left over all wrong one to fly to have seen that you wouldn't normally pay it but I move seen it falling we seen it pop fit and jumbled so you do have to at least give that credit to it is a 4-way Flex yeah it's Apollo himself please play the following Jace already we've seen her from fellow as well so fun if you first Jets game of the year for certainly a lot of strong and players for this one with brought up the table. Go get to Alistair instead as I really do like the variety of play you can get out of Champions like Alice or you can be the heart of a champion also few things away if you want to play more for back of mine certainly the graveyeah. That is certainly the most likely and with how well somebody has been playing of late I think it would make sense but give him to carry if he can take an advantageous match up off the top of a moldy if echo-fox is going to walk in there other solar later in this first round or try to save that for last fix as they are red side encountering really is the major events there and speaking of that keep in mind that these first pick for Sunday and it was pretty obvious for the beginning of the draft and it was a Viper who's up at 10 to pick up with ribbon and actually took over the math help take over the game so somebody asking you to be able to either keep that Jace flexible or be really sure of it so it has not signed a counter going to have to ask games in a row here for bang probably not as likely be killed but against the same song catch a spotlight you got Global movement you got engaged rule for these days or seeing a lot of things troubles actually closedgames about multiple forms of engage if dates is going to be one of your soldiers to your not getting teeth are Tompkins certainly isn't bringing that either so bringing in the ass is going to give you that additional forms engage in the Comcast can really help to keep this guy safe against both the Alice are engaged as well as sleepy Bubble Toes. Spare Lee mirror Champions we could put that Jason family as though we and we really expecting to be playing at there in the midst side and since I do consider someday playing stop playing jazz pretty likely in early and Soul band comes out and they might have another one who he as well or this art pictures of jungle pool as we were really only down one jungri just an option band everything else is available and not the only one that seems to be getting a lot of band in the first round these days people still feeling like the ultimate is so incredibly powerful us shutting down not only teleport with really making those device very chaotic for your opponentthe band does a novelette is Belfield to Flying J stop as well a little bit more here but it's just in general too strong band yeah it worked all over who is the guy who doesn't mind that I think it would even fit the complex that box is going towards a little bit here Sybaris typically 18 Spyder you want probably 210 to the grounds that a team fight comp really well and and you have that beef walls there was an output in same DPS more than a show remorse come over when you get rid of where the stamps come back through see if they're worried at all about any of Russia's Champions is not from performing as well this year so may not get targeted but if you want to shut them down at least indirectly an option that is going to be the final band I do think that's what he also make a lot of sense as a fan because there's not any through Frontline yet on the hundred Seaside jungle is one of the areas that they could be bringing that indo you want a date with people are building that full HD these days if you wanted to go more with your tank option you could be looking at something like his back which we just become out yesterday. But really most of the other end game style junglers are not paying that are being play these days people are building Jarvan Warrior into maybe pseudo sang be so fun of them into your I do love Jarvis and Ultron jungle pick keep mine the he gives more taxi dispatch them before so just put in the flag down is going to get more DPS over to follow them in the bottom line and he is going to be playing that engage Dumber most likely have seen on top somebody feels like he's a full-time jungle now going to be the sort of kind of pick you up for an do who does a fuse look like they're pushing Lanes almost everywhere I think Ashford liver is a bit more content but otherwise looking like a lot of early pressure and they can take over Punta the early game lissandra will still come through as welllophophore momentum a little squishy Epix On fentanyl off can be killed but I certainly have been looking at it through the window of kind of having two forms of engage you really do want to have that feel life is not much of an initiator in the later stages yes you can take them down if they're isolated out but you don't want to be starting off a fight UniFi B5 running straight in-and-out site is actually quite effective against jcr this is a smartpick and there's a tremendous amount of physical damage on the other thing you can say about that is not a tank filler so generally speaking what then stacking armor is going to be enough for the lysandra to be dissuaded from targeting this mouth if he wants to build for the match of expected expected to go, and you can trade quite effectively with adjacent to the Jason's not get a very big lead in the early stagesMilford stops caring about your damage and then post it it is incredibly scary to push whatsoever because Mal flight plus G4 can absolutely blow up a Chase you've got a black Dodge you're dead otherwise it would be very excited when I'm happy to see if I come through this I think so far of the year we are seeing so many different things come out the first time you are free to pick those out quite as much here supposed to be exciting I'm looking forward to this conclusion of Camp select what happens on the rift hear malphite certainly exciting top winner and it's going to be a lot of fun it's pretty straightforward pretty sure it's actually going to perform in this game and I do think that there is room for this Birthday meme when people are going 80 heavy cops about his bunch of these is one of those solo queue Champions as maintained a fairly High win rate as a tank and it is going to be Comet malphite going up against themgoing flat do in summer league matches what we are getting ourselves they're on the cusp of playoffs in the first round robin the group stage someday on a first pick Jace to fight against the mostly physical damage. Think of me really just to make a lot of sense here he does have to be worried if he stacking pure armor and OHP early game about any potential to hear also tracking that is going to be very important but rushing things like early Tabby's going into a Time fires going to make you so hard to take down for Rhonda and someday and I think that's the direction I'm expecting we have also seen quite a few players looking at so it's kind of similar to the hornbills that people are doing where they're actually getting a lot of individual CDR pieces and just trying to have that ultimate up as much as possible because that really is what your team fight revolves around my mouth right outside of his office is pretty worthless I've got a few tacos like I know where the time that's normally goes off on the wall wow alright hun has Bang couch that is a ward that died zombie words that's got you pretty cool and they're going to look for a potential Steel on this Red Bluff is brush going to be stuck taking a pretty lackluster Camp here but it's actually really I think you're from rush if you cannot win the toobydoo don't bother even confessed right so instead of hanging around and trying to maybe feel it or for trying to get to win a fight that you can't see his already finish this Camp he's going to be heading down to the bottom side and he eventually even go and take away some of his opponents Camp so he's not getting delayed very much here at all I think this is the intelligent response G+ Olaf is way better at level one there that's actually drop the rush hockey misses the knock up on subtle crab that is not break the shell does not knock down the extra bit of armor damage baq so that's why it will still be crushed stone I keep mine has no blew up and he went for the hunters machetes snowman reason on the stove off at all going to make the second half of your pretty rough but he's got full house will not that high in Sparta going to going down. Tuttle could have actually gone down and maybe take away one of his opponents can't because it is still going to leave on a plus-2 can assuming it's not rush a little later get to go counter to Blazing away and early damage their you do have to be so careful in those early levels the first recall a fairly important to be able to get a decent by there you thought I was just have to accept Okay I can't actually could test any of the wave until you're at the door and then you try to have by lwow farm disc is there going to be just barely jumps the way but I was last person to 410 and so was going to grab all of this farm this type of work you have been bad but he survives it so there's no way you try that after somebody takes a girl early and it's already taking the charge. You're not going to be able to actually finish them off so I handled it very well but certainly a really bought fly there a hundred. They're down two flashes they don't even kill the guy and it's even on Farm on the base so Soul has got to be the smiling about that one and Anna is down a camper because the time you spent up there's a flash with all of its chemical wash his feet again Michael Booth frontal actually flashing the to disguise their the jump in from Jason then the corrupting potion making it so somebody was going to take a car back to you at the flash out as well very poorly executed from the hundred thieves lots of pretty rough thing right here but it's like only for the squad as we can see if it works or farmed with your from klepto and a couple of spots than that but this is going to be huge knock-on effects of suddenly so look and feel very very safe he's able to take that for 3 called there's is a doran's ring to add to the Poke yeah I mean it's really big deal when you actually die dude I'd like that with the way stats at your turret the implications are huge because not only are you missing asmongold you coming back you can be down affordable level at times if you're going to be able to get back so that is incredibly scary and now so listing at level 5 years has the XP Advantage although it's going to be slighted someday we'll pick some of those up and brush it from top of that is a stupor easy killed yet so just that one play alone has really limited the amount of time that we can have to believe it it is a hard guarantee someday we'll be flash this Wednesday is sick he's not going to be 6 off this wave I don't think I'm going to take some time right now it's Rush is making sure that he's safe and cases arriba gang for Anda with how far up solo is certainly a to be one would have been a kill so smart passing even though it's not going to show much on the score line LOL confetti taking his farm he kind of just want to waste the effort and still be a very very early 02 Dragon this is very quick into the game with the pushing bottom and it's going to be at one of Lenny face resources here they are paying towards it's actually heading down to the dragon will see if he can be a 50/50 but he started kicking Spillman first what does Echo fox really nicely. Bacal Fox there it doesn't even get low enough that it has to be a 50/50 remove does pay them but it's worst flood and the dragon going the way of echo Fox there and that is such a big swing for the brush had an inkling that he could be over on this dragon in so far both legs feeling for Rhonda really right just ran straight here from Spawn it was getting pinged on the expected over on it. It doesn't have enough time to actually get into semi rain season is camp stove intelligently Rush doesn't bother fighting a dragon who he coming in your hat teleported and he was sensitive Behind Enemy Lines ask you to sell bulk the audit and not re-engaged aphromoo and bang it already use their blasted so that was a one way trip getting over an easy First Blood and using both of Summoners War
