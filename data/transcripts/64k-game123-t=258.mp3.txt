but when he looks recently like that's not really true OG with pobelter is actually not on paper that week I think they're pretty good exactly what you owe it all to see how big can a can I think that's a very important note to make as we had in the Champions like to hear that pobelter recently added to BLD has been a spoiler senior in the last couple weeks of the split will see if they can Dash the hopes of another LCS team here in dignitas looking to make that late-season playoff push with first bands in the table let's hand it back over to freak and is out for the gamethank you for the welcome back to show I am still freaked here with his tail and I want a very first and reinforce the point made about is seals usually weaker than ticketops year c u l g with faux Beltre it's not great but they're too in for over those things fixed games the guitar * 1 + 5 sinful Beltre dignitas are we a week or dance plg not mathematically eliminated but the model right now shows the eight wins the playoff bar and see if she cannot get more than setI think it's pretty safe to say that he won't be making playoffs that are playing spoiler to take down TL last week or the craziest high life I've seen in a long time in the one V3 on Sandra has had some very impressive individual performances and I do think CLG is looking better with him and they claim that being said it's it stopped right because he came in pretty late and I do think both of these teams it feels like more it's focusing on improving and fixing things for summer and if you're looking at it through that point of view then CLG I think it's feeling in a much happierAirforce axillary not from the season opener for these seats with the biggest houses won the last match between the squad that was with proud of the mid lane worth pointing out is also back in the bottom of here for CLG as kind of figure out what to do with their season the shape up for summer that is more likely story line 10 steel G D good for the summer split dignitas meanwhile again pointed out that the statistical model has a twin B&B playoff cut off so they can toss The Mortals and TSM to play all of which are hard of pwnis the bottle has the only winning this game and that's it so do you want to see if this is able to turn around a b are in a Champion Select we get the Rumble that we expect who need a place and a knight Pantheon jungle 47 Grafton Ave in Katyshould be very interesting potential or even flextop Roni so there is some options but you're expecting who needs to be playing his Rumble which has been such a good fit for him over the years and historically me is really a strong Rumble player people off GPS the kind of for you in style hair for him go for it all right going to wait and see as they are trying to maximize flex but we know that Johnson is not going to play out of a pretty regular 80 carry here looking at his games play it's been exclusively pain medicine for players or basketball players this season 10 of the game going to grab their own support Nautilus MF definitely a very strong bottom line that's going to feel pretty comfortable overall ruin I know we can see or in the mid lane I just expect to be top almost every single time you're pretty happy to buy some like an Adaptive Helm is fine. Read that I demand you need permits can take it through so he's so fond of pretty standard team composition I think they probably just go for the Abyssal mask breast try to with Dan that maybe you go for the Adaptive it's really good in that one d one but because you're not getting that Free Horn upgrade on it you're missing out on so many stats against ever and also the team fight I do think that where it has the ability to withstand that match up and similar to how we've seen from bowl and win a lot of the games this season it's much more about the pressure in your lane pushing it in and then making things happen elsewhere end with this pic for the reason people feel so strong currently is that so much of the game is revolving around the usual ejected in the river and those are areas that are and we're actually incredibly important parts of the EGT Elwyn and around the corner there as well as for bands come through silence dropped the table Olaf gone here as well as I have since I was getting picked up more and more overtime W Max very low cool down lot of Healing Wings like an aggressively like the pantheon Rumble that was a champion who got to handle that pressure well there's also a couple good ultimate already for Silas to steal that any sort of potential filter in the mid lane hasn't played a non made so far this season as it would be new for him again only six game sample be here. But the team upgrades are stronger blade of the ruined King the real heavy-hitter and we're going to see a lot more of these Fighters. And mid to see what the field is going to be from pobelter cuz we have seen in, but not LCS is scrims that weak-ass last week before doing play the room King rush or going the Triforce until much later haven't seen that a lot or some Bill do I want to see what kind of a build he is going to bring out and we have to get the Fiora so this is looking now like Rumble mid you put that you're a Top Again see orange your I think was one of the biggest beneficiaries of a lollipop Lane changes ravenous Hydra something you love to rush the additional I feel there is very helpful and also if you can get access to Detroit flights your is one of the fastest if not the fastest heroic ehlers you worked on the turret the Eerie setting it works on the turret you can really destroy those turrets incredibly fast if you can get a winning cup encounter looking for where the mattress is going to be trying to find the correct one on ones I mentioned they think the groom can being better than Sauron I think I like the you're in the irrelevant be one as well just said that you can fairly easily riposte in the East and then fight from their wisdom here but looks like a champion to locked in at least Cooney and ruin are going to be playing those Fighters will see if they play mid or top themselves but the top laners have that matchup I do think it really has a chance I think as the game goes longer I can get more more difficult but even if you can. Post relia has some really good trading even witches the longer-range Autos you can do in laying in there are ways to wrap towel play that especially if you go for something like an early Executioner's rushed and be okay and that won't be one but I'm going to see if they want to try to follow the orange around the map or if they're just we have to play in that side land but either way ton of focus expected you around Fiora making the playoffs from the outside looking in Champions like is over that means there is a five-minute delay before we broadcast the game for competitive Integrity to see you here but after this hello everyone and welcome back to the show dignitas and kind of getting about to do battle here on the rift it's a tough one if that'll be 9th and 10th CLG almost assuredly cannot make plans for the guitar certainly can they have beatable opponents on pay-per-view to be something to beat CLG we'll see if they can make the push if he said if they can and we've got fewer births are really in the toppling Vista boot I think it's going to be a really fun game winner last I am so excited for this dignitas, a lot of style a lot of the you're a pic of having Pantheon jungle there's a lot of opportunity for the camp up on the top side and persisting in Split push cenarios which should make for a very exciting game and I will do this every single karthus jungle game a cast until there are changes I want to see how fast we can complete a first clear if you're if you're really really good you get it at just barely over 3 minutes like 3:03 or something in my testing first time doing it in a month or so I got them in at 3:06 so you know I want to see if LPS junglers can can clear as fast as me that's the real it's one of those things where there's actually a lot of little optimizations with how are you devising
