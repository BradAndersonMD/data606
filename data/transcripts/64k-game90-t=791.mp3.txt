so I did both of these teams to take band last week a little bit deeper and it's very clear the values that you look what showed in week one day bad grades every single time in their first rotation and another one of the Str8 Aries do that then they could first fix the trundle and a fil F Elio's combination for Rockside tactical building a very strong 45 and in there for 2 game 13 cops were almost identical and a claim that are Oriana feel the same role of jelly is 12 times as well and the only real change was in the support picked in Corte De putear if there'll accent is going to be the grave and they want to continue putting Proctor on the trundle having it five on five subject to focus I know that Proctor has been very outspoken and streams an interview that he wants to play more aggressiveand he wants to fight more and have more play making some able to see that variation here in week number two because it leads number one very clearly Team Liquid had the same game plan he was proposed for sure well one gameplay we're not going to see different today is full of their bad right off the bat course we are on top 10 point Have Some Day or B is for the champion of the lowest win rates at least the Top Lane a lot now but won't be played at all in this game now with Grace. Fan I would expect him to pick this up to him instead of the trundle because the fourth phase Rush Graves had so much extra priority over the sun do do I taken at Keystone now or you can just basically run around my nose fillers not even care about it at all of this give me that my big gripe when I wastalking about a hundred thieves Champion Select last week do they put some day on the orange twice and someday hovers that there as a little shout-out to their last weekend so. Position of a hundred thieves using Hanks Tom day whereas he is actually their best player and a lot of people after I do to start I don't want to see him on more of a carry for you to 10 p.m. what will the eclipse affect the South Lane we haven't seen Cody sento the champion yet but was a sample of two games doesn't mean he doesn't play the champion obviously I want to be part of these will wait and see if they will know we are luchando en Orden said go grab jungle bed or coming somewhere like that video speeds blast and seconds to figure out what else to play and they are going to pick support the brush Calista likely very strong huion can have a lot of pressure here if it splits so far as the door open for the solo length Alyssa and it's likely the top linkdefinitely could go into the hand of someday we'll definitely wait on that one as the as real as soon as the most likely here for for tax bill with billiards in the variable speed band out combined with this because they do need some form of Assisi set up here and they've already seen the stress on the other side 400 leave so they know these leaked Duo down there may be a little bit more safety for the for the bottom Wing corn if you want crawfish hole in your line of right now unless you really want to see if some difficult for you if you from the jungle talk to be pretty comfortable there twisted handle lock it and it's going to be all around the map I really love the influx of switch replaced by that we've seen around the world people has been going all the a piece with the face I create so much extra opportunity and possibilities when we're living in a meta that really thrives withJurassic jungle it's an aggressive jungler or Team Liquid backed up by Twisted Fate ultimate so much more in vapor pressure and removes one of the barriers of having to get your mid laner roaming early having to shovel early and walk with the jugular now to take you to join them when something pasta already well it's going to be locked in for the second game in a row here for Wyoming to be on another late-game high damage made leader of the LCS up alongside videos that you have both been doing a whole lot of running forward and getting picked off when doing so where am I also tend to do a lot more damage last night and hasn't had those good games under him GIF be at the threats port-a-cath about is equals before so in my mind looking for those to the step up and on his ear nobody else, he can find his way in no way some more the engage tools that cord gauge avard was so good lap table here I'm expecting the other band from Team Liquid to seeing Italy as well one of the other Champions I can do pretty well is the graves. Both of them are very quickly and it becomes can't understand off when they meet early and nobody really have to commit to it definitely think of him more as the Olaf to mail a style Champions player though so let's do jungle on for right here and save the counter pick for someday this feels like a big pain from Week 1 to week to that hunts answers trying to pull in draft where I was before they are just clapping down in early orange say okay we're going to try and have a standard p55 on5 somebody just join the rest of the team but this time around it looks like they really want a cap to fix they're going to force Team Liquid to show their paw play first there's a male a kind of FEMA talking about four yeah it'll stay bad out the trundle for the team fight present for a blind orange like you were looking for a bit earlier in the draft one of those tanks they don't want to get shredded by the old that you thought as well Braves stats off of nose peeling away from Aftershock torn or strained Nautilus or an orange after they got you very likely in the strap by the way I'll walk with you by Linkin Pharmacy what he can do in the early jungle but they got to be pretty explosive jungle temp outside here so now to yell yes there was the blind orange Plaza right you know Clifton might be up there and now he's worth of quarters honestly with it I want to see some day with a with a caterpillar on the top side that can actually like when you use a game we seen a couple of tests are team sport successful and unsuccessful across the world in 58 KL into the orange and having the easier ramp up time to get your identity with a nice little couch or hear thrown in at the end from Team Liquid according to J obviously you can go for the Quaker hooks onto the threat Assessments in CST stand for a little bit locks himself in place and blitzcrank definitely can pull him over try and get that kill his a truck certainly very strong one B5 and gone last split this feels a little bit more like a spring split hunted these Braff for Sunday can take the game it was own hands I'm curious to know how much they can play around Braves Albie's he can be a very very scary jungler can get some pressure done but if somebody holds e u probably get away from everything and on the bottom side to I'm always looking at where's the specificity call early because Steve Birds 2 ultimates from Twisted Fate are very critical in the ramp of time of his composition if you're looking on the bottom side you need to do it very quickly, later is now with the beard changes have a little bit of an extra lead on bottom Lane experience or Jensen will hit that level six far above the kalista and thresh where they get so much safety down in that bottom line and it becomes much more difficult even with a Twisted Fate fate to try and force that so I'll be really looking at that time in closely for Jensen if you can gain some room at that level 6 bike size on the Twisted Fate is that goes down and going to be the one I'm looking for the most here because Haiti has been exposed to it's been a fun Champion love watching a plate especially in Pro and seeing our egos right it is the most scherff by our way of telling you what this game is about when he shows up in that lane like this is the layer trying to get this but we're kind of forced down as we're going to get 600 let's go atrax I left a mess they have a dream scenario and dragon is down and they want to go for Richfield afterwards you can get an objective that way you have jungle pressure up there but it is going to be very likely that you try and combined with blitzcrank blitzcrank of Twisted Fate match made in heaven those are the types of plays that we like to see it the combination of some of the synergies hear a whole lot of friends near him as one of the big questions around STL line of course this is why you're right over there at your like eight inches away on the monitor so we're practically adjacent we're not quite Holdings was just messing up based on the pixel density here but regardless the point is that it's okay but can't hold up Twitter doublelift it certainly Wendover underperforming TL as a whole Squad didn't do very well in the spring split so okay but you had won four titles in a row with this guy tackles in can you fill those shoes at all so far guess he's been very very good A lot of that isn't he's been very very well supported and hasn't had to do many difficult things right is pay Farm really well you know Auto attack directly in a Teen Titans multi-volume check but otherwise it's kind of laid out for him right where it where the team flights are pretty well orchestrated the blood-soaked except for the grace coming down as well as I feel pretty confident that TL get a lot of pressure in front of tactical and as far as tactical goes I I feel like we already are moving the moving past him living in double with Shadow and are moving past knew everyone constantly having these comparisons because he is really building his career in his own right or 6 play now I believe you know working really well in with this team liquid roster that has all these super experienced players and I'm super excited to see how they continue to build on that especially him and core JJ specifically doing so much and having so much time invested in them as partners uphill battle so far a 0-2 start to the split but of course they can still pick up with lots more games to play this kind of unlucky all of their game so far have been against undefeated teams it's been a really difficult strength-of-schedule 100 thieves and I think that sells them a bit short I think they are still a solid team but there again some of the very best squads they could face right now and it's it's I think giving a bad eye test when they're better than they look for sure they had in my opinion the most difficult starting schedule for week 1 Cloud 9 and EG like you said two undefeated teams two of the best teams black Square as well so they really started out with some tough competition definitely had a lot of mistakes themselves to clean up regardless and I think that now is definitely a time or they can show that Improvement who seems liquid here did come out with the two of them selves so how's your thieves continue their schedule of going against undefeated teams whenever you have a blitzcrank of course everybody is very wary of the level ones so some defensive Wars come out in the pixel brushed and they do get side on court AJ yep no big deal and we wait to see what something special going on looks like know it's going to cool off already there ferns the cleanse look back in for some damn it for Rio massive deal with that already some of your talk about in champ select two shows up on screen one minute into the gave year really short cool down so sometimes that's hard to really take advantage of wine that Summoner but they got a decent almost 200 damage as well so pretty through the health potion already for the first one for Ryoma sets up a little bit easier of a time to take control of that mid-wave and again we're going to keep our eyes on tracking Jensen and his progress towards that level 6 to try and make the big Play Someday goes for the piece of trade on impact who Dodges two out of three Sweet Spot Ali walk without any proper told again right there ghosts in is now running no longer has the ramp up time on to it you get quick right away longer cool down but it extends the duration if you get a killer in a fight so might seem to have been around for a really long time changes in the game that was most critical for Mid laners because midlanders always used to use ghost as the instant Dodge button and Jensen is a guy who was always applauded for his ability to dodge gangster Dodge skill-shot so now that goes has that instant speed you're talking about doesn't have to wait on the ramp of time I'm looking for Jensen to know what is Flash in a lot of scenarios just use the ghost and go for the side steps can be one that's a little bit difficult to sidestep but again sometimes you can see people moving forward into it and trying to outplay that way so you can get the gold star counter initiation so a lot of options for him still videos of God they were as boxer went down bottom and got a little bit more safety here for tactical and chords of Jay do you want to point out via kind of comparison Point here as we looked at things go down
