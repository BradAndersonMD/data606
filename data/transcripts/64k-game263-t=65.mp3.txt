I'm ready by Trey Quinn and we have had two very close but it has been PSM coming out on top when it counts Broken Blade has been very effective last game but really it was the DSM play together was fantastic and game number to a question to ask to be what are the changes we are going to make to change the course of this series so far Target against Molly again band away one thing I would like to see Team Liquid doing it either a drafting to protect SS in the team fight for be giving him a champion that has more safety Morphin team won ND to he was left on a champion without a move block getting Jova take it down time and time againthe same six band is game one that's very versatile bottom Lane Champions and bring crowd control to the rest of the Deep V cropped up here this often means TL should be able to take the time tent for Olay or rather to excuse me for court today I feel to protect doublelift here so that will give him a little bit of this. Back to back pain and games as a not really translated into success in the later stage of the gamegalio is one of the Champions to pair with callista you can pull the galio out when the guy that you can make with these two champs they dress up to onto can look great for everywhere all the time not only saving people as well as they are really going to be now because the block has been getting Phase 2 Band out by TSM in both of those early game that will be a switch the GP also found out in those Faith 2 bands by TSM sois going to Blind it right ear and it's still save their last pick now to pick 4 kill counter fit for tsm's bottom side was outstanding can be really difficult actually here for GP not only if you have the auto tax be able to knock down the barrel of kill pressure Post 6 there is the potential to dive and take down this guy especially if you do get a strong diving alongside it later onbottom Lance and then it broke and play plays as he has done so far this series and had to advance with Vladimir Things become tricky something like a built-in protection as well with this podcast so I do like the beginning of this rap because it's feeling more of that kind of regular people think she has the mostCorky bands now a way as well looking at Mid laners that you might see if your expense Play Once Jensen at the blind pick his own Champion still have yet to see it done with the post office and gets first dibs and so is it going to get banned away because there were very worried about the galio Darvin combo less concerned perhaps about the erect size that could actually come out graphic novel of water Bjergsen blinds made what does Jensen have additional physical damage in the lineup but you know it's very very interesting they're really prior to fix I'm curious to see what it'll be 6:30 facing off against corner with the area of the spires and the possibility of pulling in and locking up that one is powerful carry this stuff if you go forward and get pulled in verifying what are the biggest kind of school doesn't allow her to go for the dead has been a classic but it's just going to be The Hobbit and syndra will be Jensen's Choice into the block looking for the paper I must note on Pierce and he's going to go to Cinder play Rex I will be here 14 years has the spikes in der has the old and starter the same so they can certainly pick up at least one the question is what comes on afterwards he liquid a tremendous amount of CC here to write all 3 of The Carrie from T-Mobile to that Alyssa relatively short-range and they have a lot of dive and a lot of pick one thing that people ever look for with missed it is avoiding versus a loved one direction especially with very capable of going for those burst skill earlier but if you have lot of her into DP there is diving kill potential Post 6 that is much higher now with the Red Sox who can also reset TOUR Championship with the pool and the wrecks I ought to go for something I really like to try to survive Team Liquid have to make the most of this moment this time right now they have to turn the series around every finals has been 30 lacrosse 2018 backs against the wall famous to reverse sweep that TSN pulled off in the semifinals played here in North America that's such a paradigm shift here now for impact in this toppling heading to meet is a champion that needs to be Lane dominant and I feel it GP is better suited to impact play style it is still that carry but it is where you can withstand where you can stay back and contribute to the team elsewhere just survive that is I think where he has had in North America he has been a monster we'll see if this is enough to make the difference cuz so far they series Broken Blade has been the one to dictate Aspire picked up by TSM early and ghost poros are traded 15 gold 2 piece down there's going to feel solid Team Liquid doing some other stuff on the top side is Timothy will is very best to keep his farm up here both these Champion should have gray fast furious does the mid laner start to trade blows in Ghent and jewels the first damage to the game then some looking here for some aggressive positioning up by the mail a minion with the ques but jurickson pretty quick me it's worth noting down here in the bottom Lane neither of the Marksman do you have TP this time around we haven't seen teleport every game from doublelift and Ben to will be double combat Summoners on both sides and not only that Sven has gone with the hail of blades to list up this is super Lane dominant in addition to the extra attack speed here well actually was take a look at this jungle intervention first he is he's got to worry about what could be to knock up as well as an extra extra read these cleared City beer can get that link control nice got other week but once you get that link control it means that Acadian to just take that Scuttle because if you commit to it from Smithy Master room reclaim TSM getting topside Scuttle as you know look at this bottle and fresh looks pretty good for cleaning liquid site that we can play so aggressive cuz he's got a ton of cash by his side even and exhaust on that support so the backline diving that has work so well for TSM and stop that would be a really play the game that will be happening here anymore to be a much easier to fight for him and that might make a very big difference in this game and take me to get the bottom side Scuttle crab as well for some more security here for the pushing of doublelift and corejj everything is go down it will be a farm lead on the team liquid side but there's really good trade back and I do really like the to be to hear from tli favor that much of it is just that straight match up there having to ditional range the ability to poke what's a ganglion cyst on the side of the smu's very very strong with the gal you end the callista so that is why it's so important to track a warning about and knowing where he is at level 6 power in the middle and once again checking in on Jensen and Bjergsen again to scatter the week supposed to be used reactively countering the Distortion damage from the LeBlanc Jensen so far has been able to stand tall in the minion wave he's getting the push down as well get Acadian the wrecks out here to give him that option of what he would play as the final pick and that is a lot of pressure I feel like on Acadian to be able to perform here if your sim put in a tougher matchup in also a lot of trust in a guy who's in his first playoffs you have more time MVP that's giving up his counterpick to get you the right side and it's always been able to do that half of the course there's semi-final win over Cloud 9 as well I will give Broken Blade the counterfeit just blind for me I'll hold up no matter what and Garrison has been a better than Siri beat him in the finals of white how good he is by his teammates this time Jets on him he's got 15 to make it work but so far I've hit quiet in this series is first trophy on the line in three straight I guess the player who's been more than him every step of the way pretty low how far is for both Marksman down here on the bottom side without a lot of sustained left so double it then spend very very cognizant of the enemy junglers trying to keep track of uncle passing this early on and not playing too far up the farm so far so good for empaths it's grass because it's just an overall pick up what you want a bit nicer this time but did not spot it's been 1/2 HP now he is seen by the word controller turns it off but they know he's here back lace TSM no gang to be happy but now safety required and I do think the grass is really intelligent choice you not even just for the lady but if you're parking at constantly building up a beer face of Health be able to survive the potential in because we really does want to look for those sort of flies now both jumpers playing Gear around Midland Spotify that you will be now Bojangles have been alerted ghostbar on Ward doing their work here but Acadian on the right side does get priority over the bottom side River will head down to join smoothie making his return down here is achates the fog of War those words are gone I answered back good flash away just like that TSM pull off the first blood and the money given over to this Rex I accelerating the warrior accelerating the level six year for Acadia this is been his Champion it certainly has and that takes so much because I think it's a gray Health goes off their bike it's turned around on this van and smoothie we're both really low again he'll have played better for Lane phase than lethal Tempo you get the quick three otters out stack of those beers smoothie got the CC chain in the immediately rip those beers out with the ignite down pull off the kill and now it's just as the level six. Come in for impact Uso gang play Cold as you if they don't get that kill if the great health goes off then that is going to be a lot expended certainly a lot of confidential by TSM and also select crowd control their that was just want to talk directly into knock out there was no chance at all for corejj to actually get that gray help off so just perfectly done now it is starting up the dragon honest fire starter is so good I take you down this track of a DSM is moving over here to your double if the same
