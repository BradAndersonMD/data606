and looking to shred the tanks with trundle now we are in a Champion Select Cloud 9 on the blues * 4 and 3/5 into silver off the table and wait to see what if one does one of First Take he arises not but that's why I already so far this Pat aatrox still is see what else comes up as we very often seen Chaz supports now as well carmelux Yumi all-important they're already targeting the bottom line here with a silver band champion in Pro play instalok you all across the board at all levels of League of Legends right now I take out very quickly it's a super good wave clear Marksman trying to deny that and rednecks in is a champion that has arisen up so so quickly for the Top Lane and use very effectively by CLG yesterday as of what they can do even flopping role basically haven't ruined go mid with that to really capture apply for to sing, band EU meme ban here as well luck still up as the remaining Queen of the support will right now also relia has a high price Soul enter alongside the intervention from before we saw a licorice have a decent at Ali game yesterday in that's okay so they definitely want to trade some of those pics that you're imagining write the atrox and irelia they can get two for one right now with his dad wanted being taken away field you have shown their very confident and just picking a trundle into it as multiple times weekly pick that up but in the first two picked they can grab two of those powerpyx I also would put a high priority on the lock that you mention for bottom line so maybe they split it file process been amazing forest EOG if any of the High Life Light yesterday with the Lux coming up with Dave Midland One difficulty of taking Aurelia and ate rocks together and cutting trundle is your very physical damage heavy so they might be kind of shying away from that a little bit and long one of them to go over to make sure they have a good day images tribution you got the Apostle think that they're not actually yes that one. That one is graviton cast the most highly prized to Port I have to think that they've got some counter for a truck then thinking that they're baiting Cloud 9 into an a talk to make somebody feel she has done historically throughout the entire history of the organization is always leave up powerpyx you know the most contested champion in the current bed and have something prepared to try and counteracting end game to Cloud 9 take one of the two irelia so far and again keep mine doesn't want either physical damage juggler as well since you went for those same to you have the same damage profile issues it's just why you work so insanely well with irelia do like that is one of my favorite combination in all of League of Legends as the Top Lane and jungle combination because they can stand so well off of each other problem as well going to add a little bit more safety here to the D9 Scott and everybody just staying away from the atrox after it's been so dominating such a huge Deep by force only took the Froyo type bonus right now I got plenty of stuff come out of the lineup is there really is going to be. what's going to happen across this past 9.12 was in Chandler heavy Ardent censer meta everyone should run High crit March 10th and it said you got tank Sports on both sides as real as an entree at Marsh minute it's a bit similar to the old versions here as well and he's going to go far farther and farther farther down that the two lists here maybe you'll get Bandit II rotation steel GE easier way they need both are stolen in less time catches Fleck and Cloud 9 need one pillow and also its glacial not really more focused again the Top Lane rumbles been a really North American Focus Champion I feel like I'm looking out across that allows the other we really highly prioritized it's actually our second most hit Top laner does BBQ have quite a few Rumble players and after that one away from licorice I'm frantic down final bands coming through coz the last band of the draft they can also can't keep my dick in a trap from those fellows as well look want dropped off the expect maybe Liquors take the irelia pitching nisky somewhat we are highly prized quite a bit not these you just pee wee Champion syndra is it going to rain moriana as well both those might not want to deal with a loved one to deal with ADD Accents in the mid lane because few weeks generally will play Champions without dashes but we'll have lots of damage and scaling for a big eight p m fight for it okay for my blend stolen going to be required here for CLG that O'Reilly's in one of the two lanes but not which one just yet those missing liquor store that championed just fine they've got a very safe bottom line for themselves so I'd expect you if you need to go aggressive with their picks for the top half of the map and Dave the counter Pick 4 ruin just getting fucked power of evil yeah a generalist made one of his most played Oriana hear the creator of the well at least you're at least the promoter of the nashor's tooth orianna style will they be able to get the four-for-four meal is Right Here Right everyone is going to feel good at once I said you wanted everyone to Pack and Stack up towards that something passes for Lakeridge every chance they get though it has gone for 9 and he has looked amazing on it so I think this might signal akali top and irelia mid of course you still do you know can't move them around at will but licorice is go to for the past few weeks Hispanic Ali it has resulted in back-to-back Cloud 9 losses so I would say not the akalis fault not you know who to licorice know absolutely I think is better than a great player and outperforming member and now it's the algae's turn if they do expect the akali top when it more likely one of the do regardless double melee and games like will come through yet again have see this matchup a lot Gangplank into the melee Champions a little bit easier to attack them with the barrel trading back with the burning damage in the store if they do try to hit you back and ruin is going to be a high damage player and he's got some decent rates are not super reliable for either seen on top laner here and can get kills with that Feller and I would definitely recommend for Gangplank if you're trying to use this type of counterpick going with the grass route to can stack up the health akali still very threatening and once you hit that level 6 as one of the danger points BP will still have to worry about now we are going to take down last 3 seconds give me a call in the top in for liquor if he's going to put of stuff up there that passes can help a little bit knocking down barrels ruined though has been a standout Wiggly especially in can evaporate Spence Karen's defenses with King tribute and subjugate is the one that she still thinks he's a passive it is being fairly similar things my mind is getting a backwards regardless if they get this one five wins in a row they retain control of first it has been an incredible split for them so far Cloud9 know this will be our last stage game before Rift rivals on Thursday they will battle Europe's best and origin and it's going to be exciting if we get ourselves ready to go to the ER as well and find a way this is just our new League of Legends we have a new mode we will wait to hear what exactly is the cause this one but it has been scaring back on stage for the first time this week it was blabber put a couple of games in we heard coach reprints say they wanted to give her some stage time use them as a secret weapon for a secretive for Rift Rivals to make sure that the jungle stop going to happen if you'll good I do always think it is very interesting how most teams will prioritize having the jungle so bright it really does feel like the most valuable role to have a substitute player at because you get to sit back during the games in best-of-five scenarios with the coach discuss your the enemy jungler sprouts and bring in a fresh and clear head for the next game that we were the roles that benefits the most from coming in off of a stickman position because they'll all the lanterns you know it's going to be if you have a substitute later it's mostly about how good are they how well if they perform recently Instagrams the lane matchups aren't any sort of you know big game to game different it's much more you know for the jugglers in decision-making absolutely so a quick word on what happened here we are remaking the game real quick same picks and bans reloading into it apparently an issue with power bills runes are they didn't load in correctly so we making that redoing his rooms and as we all load back up in the lobby will join up again very shortly so I'm doing that myself waiting for the game to go up and then we will get yourselves the first game of the NLCS week 4 Day 2019 lots of titles kind of available here for this one I can tell you're trying to feel buddy the game though I'm feeling for my own brains in my okay there we go lobbies up the password through the process me and what I see is be joining the client and and I had referee hasn't got to spectate yet a fool for McCain I actually want to touch on this because when players make mistakes like this you know any choose the wrong room absolutely I would ten thousand percent much rather have the waiting time of remaking the game then having a situation where you're forced to play with a sub-optimal rune that's always in the back of your mind you know that this game doesn't have a full credit so definitely taking our time here to make sure that we don't come in on uneven footing especially for a game with this much important at the top of the standings yesu the case all 10 players are in the lobby now so we will be starting champ select version 1.1 in just a second here I think it would be same pics and then there was no action or game of Records do if I have some areas directly to be fine for this one I have at once there was happy the ready to go the scene on players that they are ready by 4 I said he was as well Spencer has asked me what is your favorite meme have an answer to a question my faith internally sweating GIF guy actually really enjoy deep-fried memes like they don't they don't make any sense at all it's just about like putting on mass of Photoshop filters that you can barely make out what's behind it and the jokes are just that it's stupid I'm sorry I asked you the other story so I talked with clg's Academy chocolate bun cuz I thought he was in in the lobby waiting for game to start and I asked him I wish him good luck of course as I was behind it but with all the players but I'd hate winter predictions actually I think is going to win but I thinks it is popping off like a really good right now but even seal GK members thinks you had better have often had so much support from the other players in the league I think they're especially good them and their Academy team at at performing well in scrims and it always have this reputation of like oh my God like Cloud 9 no matter what the record is them coming into the game you know they have so many options and then that is true. A lot of people talk about especially Reaper 10 and how they're drafting it's very difficult against Cloud 9 to to know what to expect people compliment actually work for this this. If you are commenting C9 Academy is just like even there other Squad is there really really good to like there's some incredible tires out there so definitely or gets a lot of credit I think they are very very strong team we are into those not on screen the second round's the same picks and bans we are four champions so far for Apple to Champ select in the middle of the game and then be in it for real beautiful Graphics thank you for the auction team this is what they were picking the way they will again if we look down at once again the GP on topside definitely a possible Target here for early action as real-time can't just so difficult to create any action in so it seems like svenskeren top triangle of the map that includes we have talked about it at midlane up and up words right kind of cut halfway across the map and you try and get to control that area as much as trundle in The Surge warning much later is so effective and everyone mentions always be exchanged you know they are especially with Aftershock taken by Sage wanting early onset Sewanee does has so many options actually she's quite a potent ganker Spence Karen has been a lot of time in the past ganking for licorice and it has been time well worth it this guy especially on a college is worth the snowball definitely agree final Champions have been locked in place of shopping around so the 50 second timer continues and then the loading screen will begin is definitely top Lanes going to look like an exciting at peace here I do really enjoy that it was grabbed last pick your 59 side when you see that seal Jeep don't want to grow a spot lame they want us to take Farm you grab it a good scaling champion in the guys that I'm curious if I come out of her I was going to say how how do you feel about the build right now feels kind of weird to me. Never one doesn't it's a sort of like about one-third of games has the item into it I don't really feel like you sue for need it I think you're generally okay on Mana regardless and I personally always like building in portrait so you can maybe killed him an auto attack sooner yeah I'm definitely not a fan of it but I literally only tried it one game so small sample size regardless
