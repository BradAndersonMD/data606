they did beat them straight up in week 3 and work out of the first team to do that so I certainly coming off of a strong wind but everyone has had quite a bit of time to prepare and scrim and practice during reprisals and drink that off week for the first look for these two teams on a patch of course 8:15 with the extra balance Michael Pate trucks very very strong and no surprises first band to hear gold Guardian have learned wisdom of the entities which they had learned a week ago but that's where we are here again so people are at least respecting him on it enough to throw those bands his way I will see if he ever does get it and we'll be able to connect be given that opportunity for 4 but this is a couple games now that have been banned against Gastly and of course game on the Champions going to be open tonight for him and you're going to keep that one going in a positive direction they are expected to attend school in the gardens hereexpect a possible if you go to a follow-up or follow really has the one on Markland game on flat Amir I do is mudo here if you are going to wind picked up anyway grabbing little early I think he's one of the safest a guide you can do it on are we going to be sleepy mattress like serious which can be pretty good in the ones you wanted to do but he meant bad matchups effectively with fever and if you're playing safe can work quite well and also need to have that Frontline in combination with Kindred I mean it's going to be kind of about for the damaged coming from the jungle sets that's good about. Existing right now in League of Legends of course of physical damage drunk and a high damage Chapin General one of the really rare things is not decided to physical damage scaling physical damagethey are not good enough as your only physical damage Source if you're playing at tanks at Kendra's certainly can be that if you're getting those Bounty for Leanne often you have a long-range bonus and quite a lot of popping up in Solo Fue and around the world are so this is going to be heavily about you know so you can start your own Rafters of the Talisman get level to immediately go to Lane and trying to be pushing up stealing your opponents Raptors harassing your opponent in the jungle and a couple of cell phone games last week or so or Diana and then whatever one's for it if you're flying through the side of the lane you get you can just stand in line behind the wall like 10 man of her second back from towels because you're technically in the kitchenand yet I feel like I should have seen it online where exactly is going once in awhile to poke some Camp the way but not quite that same through TV one lane you're sitting with those pork and vegetable funneling earlier this week and what are the big things to me that but I'm kind of using to track how successful this is how many of your opponents can't do after taking away far too many pro games of mid Smite where the person take away their own Raptors over and over from their own juggler and then you're not really going fast food and resources that you're getting a bit ahead of your phone as a mid laner you're not using the game you're just making your own jungler weaker and do like the tube and tear of Zen and Graves at the worst matchups I find for Kindred grave just have such high early birthday dude very very effective actually doing Kindred and even post sticks are you often come out first The Great out of your ultimate Zen also another paper and that really makes FRP to challenge for those bouncies very thin case down and kill Kendrick in those early levels so you know a lot really feeling like it focused aroundis playing you have an aggressive mid laner who can push up who can help the challenge for bounties alongside this Kindred you've been out some of the most effective jungle picks against Kindred and you're really saying hey contract needs to get strong this game and have a big impact stick right here from lir fourth Reich it's gotten us very very beginning get pushed off the circle that can damage you kill them off and spend in the past a great Master before and I will follow on I believe it's legal mostly champion in LDS history verus though it is actually a few of these Champions that you have positive interactions against the kindred's Vault Morgana can stand in the middle and time your solo tackles so this that can actually forced others with that goes goes off as the ultimate expires channel the ultimate in the middle of that and try to time your are two for the explosion coming out so there are a lot of those do you have to be careful about we are going to get to see a judge in to rock a bottle and we have been seeing a lot of genderdoes Arie talking about recently with some of the hail of blades interactions with gin and how about factors that can be I have been seeing on life even a lot of stories are plus rapid fire Rush on in for that really powerful at 200% crit on your first Auto can a poking people out it and going for more of an early game power but you can still go for standard cryptology Kendall police ality there certainly are a couple options on the table here for the gym just got a pretty nice I do expect to be hail of blades on his Champion definitely his first Vision pic of the split as well but I'm very sad to see a few new faces that way in Champlin some returning absolutely of course but going to be a very fun want to walk for a self-titled Colin in the Midland For Mickey's very aggressive player a very high risk loving player he can go 10:30 to go 0-10 before his Golden Garden with a 10-0 start for him but I want to watch Formula vs. North Park Lane celebration I believe his first are the split as well certainly again not an unfamiliar face but instead of revolvewait to see how it's going to go for a slice of March and I think that you could say it's it's to North favored in the early games can a fracture counterpick I think that mood dokkan him very easily pulled out his farm well against if the Nar wants to commit to a full split push to help but barring that mudo should be fine to hold on and I think so much for Golden Guardians their success is going to be depended upon this mid jungle Duo getting in the face of it down in bounties on the contract because if you have a talent and a kindred chasing you around your jungle take away all those bouncies Greg is from very behind become very very relying on just your playmate in on the initial engage on the initial ultimate the Cape of watch that as the game plays on but meanwhile if you want to catch the NLCS life head over to Ellie sports.com tickets you can see your faceFrozen Casper's in the flash or you can see that it's still available to buy tickets for as we watch invades throughout the river back and forth as well as a trade their blows everything's fine quick call if I was as does if you were to be hail of blades Forge in the bottom end up going to be kind of exciting new ones there that's worth Nikki is still sitting on that Smite everything else pretty much as expected yeah it's it's only going to be pretty interesting one we haven't as I said really been seeing much Jen at all but really like a super super tank EDM although I think they're real terror Forge in teamfights is going to be dealing with you know swing gragas combo that in and of itself in a boot device and can actually set up for the swing passive pulling into an ever-moving once you get on top of Jen can be very very difficult so you're going to have to seal or low buying space before is Jen for his is Kindred and then really creating some States pay for them a long time looking for Spanish Toronto Raptors and Cavs going to go try to stop him to last it's a small chicken as well make you will not think it level 2 off this camp but still going to be up in XP and money back to be so that is the beginning of a cell phone gaming he'll be going to walls and Raptors again in the near future to able to take away enough that I've been should have the early push me actually end up being the first one to get level 2 I guess so well handled there in the early game you do a little bit of something hot to The Middle on top side cuz obviously the world of was Tulane first he can maybe get a bit more experience there but things are looking pretty good going to go to Five. The bottom side of crap that's going to give him the Mark is it actually was there already looks like there's no real attempt there from here to try to grab that he's kind of been his own jungle and supposed to be an easy fight in the one on one TV the way more trades the mid lane and Nicki fight because of this item sorry I don't have any actual combat pensive Lane Destructor 3 potions that's all he's got but no extra AZ no extra help so kind of react to how difficult it might be also have it does have teleport to get back into labor no contract wants to gank missed you can look for this is far enough back of this is may just be helping a Budget Inn in that is going to be the answer here allow me to push and reset a Mickey got to go back to base and buy up I'm not marketed it's one of the top Gutta Leslie or killed it a little delay of that a little bit more in early game matchup of a kindred versus gragas so much as comes down to 10 you actually what the body slam from Greg can you hop away from that or Flash that because that's when the Moon is beautiful Guardian how much did Apollo actually lose one more time this very well with the silence and keys made for a child as possible was a good Vining there from Jaco contract to pick up with Bill and contracts is always stated to die from that last PowerShot endodontic I was but a small goalie to Golden Guardians themselves episode of Power for the run in California and Elena follow back in there only missing the back half of that wave and there's no rush coming for you play Golden Garden in the round side kind of setback in this one-horse those killed mean definitely is already at BSR which again were expecting to be the Storm movie take my way to campus of the trade you make when you should go for a dive like that on the bottom side by the enemy jungler to come in and take away some of your camps but I mean look once more for this sort of real gang I mean Jaco is is without any Summoners I think at the second kill you wouldn't mean there's no TV on Apollo either and here he is its Vision craft show for Apollo Guardian 301 they got another kill to get the flash out of the following the bottom side is going to be rolling very early on here for Golden Guardians beautiful stuff is the dueling that we are giving a lot of credit to and was good of the end of spring split I got to get a lot of props for considering a pretty high levels Domino's special events one of Naas very best instead of historically best to Elaine Apollo talked about kind of think everyone gets the respect of the great do you open with his contract gangs they are building a legal guardian gang coming in from contracts and and Lyra has really been nowhere to be seen he's level five. Farming fairly well on the gragas but you know Craig has one of the strongest level 3 gangs in the game right you know when you hit that level 3 the body slam Flats you can look for those early play isn't even dare to carrying either or either of those two might be looking at a very different game that's true but sadly there has not been a big gank her in those old days from the year or so ago from being a big first blood king don't quite seem to be around anymore and it actually shows the Night Ranger the bottom side now spotting what can say around because Colin was on the road here in the TV came into way too late to actually answer no kills going back the way of Clutch and Stephen is not really even going to be able to make Mickey Lu's many minions here in the midline is the bounteous The Kills everything going the way of golden Guardians in this early game is it looking like a thing of beauty for them so much pressure has been put on by contracts in teacher considered by many to be a very weak early-game ganking jungler but they know they have it Alan Cumming so fussy to round a flight is going to be bad for them do Summers on the bottom line here and that roof follow up Nikki coming over the wall be able to help finish off lyric before the TVs come in and then have to cancel at 7 but you have to wonder why was that TV not so much earlier right you know that could have been a good 10-15 earlier if you have a chance of running around right behind to level 6 ready to go and attack your back line so maybe some misgivings here for the Clutch Gaming run around the map and picked up a second rotation to chickens here in the top side vs. Mundo match expected for me so if worrilow a great pressure from solo but it hasn't resulted in massive CS leave it hasn't resulted in any kill or a really much dirt damage either so this is kind of just being relatively stable and on the bottom side of the map your + 30 cs56 236 who killed princess like ahead that now even without getting help you can see clutch is just basically don't off the minions completely rough times ahead of horses very harassed face filled out of map on this rock of the three points in a silent so kind of spread out from here but it's going to be a very original sirocco's we didn't get to see him bring up very much last split but a lot of work into the the new Soraka Inya Maxon Lane in had a lot of sweets of a lot of wind but that one but I need to be pushed down is not Skating Gold without attacking it and
