names of split barely Clinging On to fly out with that booty early today and he said he felt pretty good about how to split have gone so far that that the team the players at that falls over to come to both it was time to really step up when is last two games get the plastic it if we do it and they're hoping they can a lot in this final week as you said CLG fighting for that playoff I would be huge mean you go straight to Detroit guaranteed win or lose in the semi-final to get those all-important Championship points because especially if you were in the playoffs in Spring you need to get some Championship points need to be in good position for that, if you're wanting to fight for worldlocate right here so CLG fan away the Draven off the dropping off the atrox and I really am curious what does come through optic these beans and do very well on its way to Champions for the topping for dhokla H rocks and Poppy for the probably the big Popoff Champions there for him and trucks were to go gon do on a first pick in yeah pretty interesting and we have seen in North America the champion has been so much more popular than elsewhere in the world when you look at it as a major 5 Regent it was sitting at like no 40 50% presidents across the top five America has been extremely popular here and will remain I have high thus far not a big surprise you miss everyone by the way so no surprise to those ones dropped off a table about the still digging the trench Banning High present Champions that every teen wants to play and we'll see what I can come through more TaylorMade on each sidewhat would it be really interested to see if any of the teams have any big surprises worse coming into week 9 if this isn't kind of the time to put all your cards on the table and really fight to get a high as you can in those standing so if there are any your secret pics if there are any surprises at least you have I have to get the good time to bring them out no optic here if they were able to take down CLT to putting themselves in a great position to play often are we know that few ehat is a guy who has been known to for walking pics maybe there's something that you can kind of try to prepare against one of his popular pics if you leave it up to gaming sitting one game above the playoff of a one-game about 7 G2 Esportscould not win with Karen yesterday spoiler alert if they pick it and when they're better than service ruin I love Cindy the champion I want to see if lights even more often the LPS State maybe at Worlds not here yet though classic Warwick hovering there from Wiki Jungle by mediaocean of the question remains are we going to have hairy throughout your pain will get locked in so I will see if they're willing to try to take away desire that you didn't care we haven't seen you these last couple weeks or more and more work on your separate from the Sia in the path of it always been kind of the logic that Sia is the one that is the stronger individual pairing to write that first Who We Are by the play making that work on offers so highly that there's a number of what does play work on even if it's with you know Draven Hurd World whoever doesn't even matter we just want you gay if you could work on right now is considered to be best of the engage Boise right now to pick him over a love for over Nautilus over those other kind of options there for the engage support spell Ricotta's one they want the fourth easily causes Darvin for some forward motion that we could be steals you play aggressively 15 points dank basement how that plays out the first place for off the plane and most likely the jungler here is executing those themselves so they got this fixed it was most played the fork go in a certainly a comfort pick up there I just think that's what makes a lot of sense when you already see that hard engage coming through you don't want to play a low Mobility Barse then who can be kind of preyed upon by the rakan and jarvin, Azrael should help to stay safe and also your Nautilus can offer him some pretty powerful lockdown to work on it something that I've had a lot of it's worth talking about how does it have a pretty strong match if he is very switching Hotpoint go see see if he goes in a yocan Pokemon is it gay slang the route like he can just get blown up because you can lock him down before he can jump back out to safety definitely a lot of damage can be there in like a syndra comes through even for you to more of that explosive up front damage for Cirque on a lot better bass. Ended last year so he's a bit thank you but you can still blow him up in the band away from dope the medication has been fits on a top cod4 him I certainly wasn't all about the crust on in that game but it has seen a lot more kind of bands then pick this far and it feels like a lot of things haven't necessarily been practicing or preparing against it so they'd rather just take it off the table and there's the Poppy Van oil to remove top lend me his best what we've seen him do well with on stage but they're not the blind pick something it's used to get last pick in this game yes it's so interesting you know if it is just a lot of Champions with dashes then certainly poppy is something good to take away but generally I feel like Banning out ruin it is super effective because he has such an enormous Champion bully played what 10 different leave this split so you know it's always going to be something for him to play it is Instinct see optic take away the kind of two primary pick for dhokla at least the ones that everyone else on the outside is across 16 games at dhokla has 15 on HRT combine who played in the first place where it's like really that high that's insane and five right across this could be the 11th Champion played for ruining this game I did miss the thing ever got to be there but we are going to be seeing what comes through as we know it's the almost over, but who knows things around covering stona they are going to blame for power of evil the second picture pick his force on the most played this split and they will indeed give ruin counterfeit both taken away so you know what is I think I'm fairly safe to pick to go for you know there are some other answers of course up there in and ruin having counterpick we had such a flexible pavement full make a lot of sense I do think Victor here for the crown would be pretty strong mathways there with glaze clear scaling scaling in that they played new definitely adding a lot to receive vitamin Nautilus has that powerful lockdown make it very easy to land the lasers to have the Castform arrowverse office of these carries and potentially be able to force them down yeah I like around the champion a lot one of his signature pics absolutely and you can do it in the butt in gear as well as Optica the Roundup of composition did you make sure that spouse is in the right lane and they just got what do polls going to fly himself we have seeds inside. But Jay seems much more likely backup enable this week that's what he grabbed up his third base gate is flight for dhokla I would be interesting if they if they want to go towards it as an answer to Jay's I do think that malphite know can be pretty strong there are also we're together pics that people used to be pretty comfortable with back in the day when it was more popular we have not been seeing a lot of narva Rangers raised can do quite alright who has so many options that will actually be the rumble all right then going going for the rumble here do you can itemize into the armored quite easily and then start to get very cranky going through things early like Seekers like a bee does help you a lot what are the wrinkles be happy to take you into consideration is that Silas is going to be magic damage so if you do stack your armor and no HB other New York only fairly vulnerable to those Medio skanks but if I certainly does have powerful wave beer powerful team fighting people like that is very much the name of the game gear for counter logic gaming solos with a Leo ultimate the easy setup coming through from the Jarvan as well as his work on and that is really where their bread and butter is going to be my 914 is the past where J's Scott lower Earley attacking me to spell power and we are still 914 satterlee rank of Shield is still incredibly strong on Ron both and got to withstand all of that Pope damage deal do fighting for a playoff biopic fighting for a playoff spot they are one of those sevens play for the windi I believe at least guarantee a tiebreaker if not getting out rid of your the dunes failed to execute here we go out of the rift as the cops are locked in Optics thing that's Okla going to feel comfortable on the Jason seals you giving ruin counterfeit say that Rumble is the kind of methods we want to have here anytime you want to see how often does decide to play this out as well you're there is always the opportunity to split push when you do have a day but you know with Jason and asriel you also and looked kind of go for these legality bills and his group at Oak and try to look for the cheap flights through that style of play they're exciting one playoff positioning on the line here in the last week of the year the last week of the regular season postseason on the mind the chance that world on the North America animated MSI finals living in those shoes would be great. Thanks again eight and eight hoping that eight or nine wins maybe even more to be enough to make plastic thing as Square Off you'll know Crown actually taking sleep but work you're so this this is how I want to say it was actually the first I saw doing it was Pee Wee and it certainly had been taking Fleet on on Victor and as well as some of the other Champions even like Oriana it does scale off of AP as well so as you get further into the game you can actually be pretty powerful and is going to help him to stay in through the area in the score at the Pope during Lane a lot of movement speed during the fight so as we still G engagement ring with some words down we had to say about his being and specifically Wiggly yeah I'm definitely shocked that we're doing is where I think you know I didn't expect to just one roster changes going to change this much about him but I did really good players I think the one is the president most Stephanie Wiggly though he just like I don't expect him to be as good as he is now and especially even myself just being honest like I was expecting to just start popping off and do really well I thought he needed a lot more time just giving office results last but but he eventually but 416 South one else yesterday and took the championship finals himself so the right person slot in I mean we had ruined flying over in turkey and well looking like a Playa Fly Over CLG they've definitely had some scouting and picking up players and how you can see Emilio's did start Stihl G's red so weakly is actually just doing in a vertical jungle is going straight down to the red that they had worked it out and we are going to end up in this scenario where it should just be split math I think are very happy to initiate this cuz they want to play forward this J's they want to be in with a J's getting go ahead of ruin it does mean yo big and arrow are going to play. Eventually be down here on this side but as real as perfectly suited to that so I think this is very intentional and make sport isn't there a difference here though is that the entire can't hear callers all the with a lot of golden experience believe it or not the big one had to leave because of Arrow coming over to stop him so it is going to be the same kind of hamster getting cleared out of gold and XD given over is quite different here and it will favor meet us in the long run I do believe as temporarily you've got one came up for Wiggly but I think it's still more to be done over all that media also get a little bit of a 80 gold whatever not going to be enormous by any means but certainly will be nice and you can see still continuing on that vertical juggling both jumpers will be able to grab a Scuttle outside quite a long time looking to try to threaten to dive gear Fourth of July will not even lose his life Force 1 early lease here absolute owl planter besides up on the knock up turn the flash to avoid another one stays alive still very far down do incredibly important that he was feeling pretty doomed because we'll be able to get some nice folk down on ruin but he needs to support him a little bit on the way out and it overheated to know where is Lowe's coming out and they can walk away earlier they get big very low he's still to actually have the shield and he just gets worse down arrow though could trade back on the way to get to very low and then watch this site that file Frost go sonography steps back out of it dodging through then weekly comes over flat out of the flag and drag the turret shot gets the kill Arrow just play that out so damn well and the TB in response there from Crown was fantastic but child support Bill Clinton was actually behind and is forced back to base and off of that wave because lately had ended up in that Top Lane and and was kind of threatening a potential dive at the game State now it's 600 in the lead for object about winter on August the important for that one you want to go on a biofrost one who claimed First Blood and not as gold synergistic as maybe a diet would be so tell her it's a little bit there on this LG side certainly wasn't so I can just sense though I had an especially before his base you know it's barely even there now and he make sure he will get a Shame by so that is quite nice giving them the additional combat power there are you conceited Oakley exactly rushing toward the hex Drinker where ruin is going more for kind of help style of Bill likely working towards Julie Andrews early on and I think is make a lot
