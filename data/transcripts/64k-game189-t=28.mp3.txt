ain't nobody bringing SKT downtown downtown they fell in game 3 they bring enough monkeying around they got to close this. Yeah they do leave it up more for the Ali still maybe but not important things like puppies still available means that I think that is enough to be able to justify changing the priority in the drop right now to arrive in the priority on the rice keep in mind you're not having very strong games and games in both games was in the rise. Baker a bit more let's take that for ourselves play Fast and Furious through this song coming out right now to come out this is really putting splice for the test on there can't be a correct match ups when are Thalia is it going to make it better I think there is a genuine 1% true that if you are able to flashing at the Impala stunt into an immediate like however that means a lot of this game is going to be about the top of the map and what we've seen so far is it splashes able to make it about North Kern and call bags and the ability to teamfight as looks like they are having most except so I think that this drop so Bob would be pleasing at 1810 North Sharon still does have that with Kranks available if it falls through the draft face I really like the look that North Karen was giving on that I can get with Kai next best performance alongside that Nautilus last events come out twice must complete the reverse week they got two more to do drop in the blitzcrank down as well as exacting trash has beef with effort download it brother the champion tool but if you are sat right now you can remove that all right you have lost band coming out of that page you can really live in it and if you are feeling incredibly I guess you know it support brackets that go into the bottom line you know something that would be able to pick up and had children at 10 already at well so I think the area is now that's why I still look in the pic that answers that I have to take pick up phone I do expect it to be a support pick so they can kind of get more information 590 there instead going to send that bring up into the waiting arms of Quinn as well and what would I do believe they're going to be how far down the ladder is he going to go to find something I mean other possible support that have been banned at a lot this tournament or things like that are still available yeah what would make the match up a little bit more bearable yes please now by picking up. Here it also means that if North Darren goes towards something like a palm Kent that you can punish it more just because you can stack in the syringe and then pull it going to go to this one here seen it a hundred percent going to be open say that would be the toughest matchup of everything we've listed so far so I think that this is an area that they would be really comfortable to have landed in inches going to be hot and fresh down there in the bottom line however the tools now fit and Katie I actually much more heavily in that 131 split up the map try and drag black around and if we going to win some of these games team fighting in through making the game simple sat was a very good answer now and I'll pull the game there's no on this time around there's no Camille in the mid lane and should not inhumanoids up so he found gate number 232 have a very good matchup I really like Cinder into the ride ride I feel like without the guarantee that has to go through through animation kind of looks him in place in Sanford right back damaged really nicely in that midlane play very heavily into the wave as well so I think that's in the area if you really he's going to continue to play while he's going to go back there for a picture of dragons Rise right there so I agree with you kind of been the one V one not two but I think when you start including some of these jugglers it can go either way but it's about what connecting there because quite devastating all these lames guaranteed La Quinta mid back pain third play of the Year might be a lot of pressure on up there my eyes remain on top of those kids prices so good they're best performer in my opinion right now again on the rip open it close it out with that wedding know they can strike again and I feel like early jungle popping has held so much play over how the series has gone I'm going to say now on the Thalia special ability to be able to walk in topside jungle and split the map Thalia level 1 is so incredibly strong at being able to force into jungle say where they doing it looks like just a standard fan I feel like it's split map right now would really suit Chachi he would love for that to be able to come through it's about with a splice take the risk and while we are focusing in on the top light to cleanse and not having access to the teepee obviously makes sense when you have such high Mobility on a champion like when she's not as reliant on teleport as other top laners but certainly respecting how much kills what can be up here across until you're acting a little bit even more than respect because he's also gone away from press the attack which is going to be the major K Starr normally that you see taken on something like Quinn so there you are that he can just die in a single combo yeah the way to the work of the combat pattern is instead of fun chunking for 3 and backing out its land 3 and then chase down the Renekton humise now faster than this supports quite nice a lake in Baton the blue bypass can be stolen I'm very scared I hope she normally a champion in his wheelhouse that we really expect from Chachi this year the wave was going to get some depth of the temperature for Chachi and Khan doesn't have an easy way out. Finally just go to space and it's what does 1x however this is so dangerous, believes this isn't going towards the top side of the Mask wanted to covering humanoid I need protection from the way of again they spotted out Khalid on some visions of a new that there was a potential the level to gain Clinton now bottom mod is working is it a flashlight come out early game he can take it very aware that he needs to have an impact early we already mentioned the jungle is a holding a lot of sway however I do feel like it's being able to Zone, love so much experience and go to this is going to ultimately be a triple bond and when you swap notes for kids I think a very so literally game so far from splice is the recipe for success for splicing all of the early games we say all the time we have to drive at home Thursday is so important to the team and Ani Champion that can jungle so quickly like to lie if that is so much movement around the month it is really about controlling the pace of the game figuring out where people are in just making sure that Cersei is constantly forced to the punch call me when you got to pushing up in the topside Chachi every time he Auto should pick one and returned from a wear him down so far is held on to his health potion no just use the door in Shield lap anybody can yeah he's down 10 CS holding on so fast me Big Damn it to the sexy a lot at the heavy chunks in every trade it back on 200 hp turn active and you feel like that is at a minimum going to be a Teleport back into the lane and, therefore justifies the use of the Clans as a summer to spell already in this game set up a flight and the setup was a beautiful from splice at first but then of course I'm not connecting with these weather Bali right there me to take a look at the water softener not going to take too much damage back supposed to hit at that you do arrange disadvantaged so whenever you see those trains coming across from SKT just be very mindful of who Teddy is heating this is who called a thief. Attack looking now at me upside the attempt it's done for Chachi he'll be in range of how it's going to build a lot of space and it's called trying to run away not if he's going to keep running but gets out just in over for Stan from splice getting the flash out of Chachi you can see what is a kennel allow the way without teleport to be in this position so they should be opportunities and once again look for a fight pretty far up is a map of the rays do to get a very fixed on it going to be with their kind of back-and-forth Lottery, stay alive, get the recall but none is not going to be level 6 yet so cannot take the bird back to Lane note to try to get the fries you might just make it around the side of the week and this is repeatedly what flights are going to try to do what they need to make these Hills. Connecting away from the easiest having to burn this I'm going to spell very nice platform clown with a cleanse and as soon as you don't initially killed a rain check they just get all of the advantages in the chase able to turn around so much damage the recall comes through pain now has the cutlet has extra proper tool to deliver an extra little spell that will help turn on phaiser to be needs it in the slow helps of course as well get to get 600 gold different that's what you get from a first-blood long has insisted that he cool game all other things considered Top Lane Farmers in 5 level 6 in perspective as well there's a small window we're actually Chachi my people to brutalize them we want and it gets going to be missing in favor of humanoid he hasn't the teleport back to the wave and fakir is hitting in about 10 PS describe it to you once he's going to be collected from humanoid so once again slices rookie me latest Epping up on the biggest the biggest name in League of Legends and having a very good early again so crash here from splice means that there's a potential for a Dodge their Cesar next snow flash either that's going to be a really nice lead time fault but it's still Farm tonight is going to be a flight to Chachi it going to be is Brompton is Katie answer with air pressure on towards the fertile trait to the question how much is Con Lussier cuz he's out of the way if he's out of the turret knocks it down get most of that farm in fraud rate for half away if that's a good thing for SKT yeah I really like to trade coming out from SKT right now they know that this is going to be a big area of pressure topside how is it now thinking not really hovering Up Akon has to be able to trim the wave and we'll be able to do it successfully so so much time invested from Splash at least nothing until play with access to his bird is playing this very safely knowing is there a things going to try for the blue box Mike that's going to be just in time there was just barely space for y'all to come through tonight just to make sure I have enough damage at Freddy's going to drop in the rain gauge comes across humanoid but that Tower diapers into a disaster for a credit instantly on the teleport did not waste a single beef series and again Khan has pushed in this way if it is frozen again soon he is being very stubborn and trying to chip out Chachi Pitzer say it's just continually providing cover. Lena and that's why Quinn top is so scary that you bought the W every 40 seconds you'll have a jungle raised here I know how to play this is Bitcoin going to be worth it compared to just be synced there from multiple members of SKT going back to the Queen Question she's not really getting any sizable Advantage because there's a and Josh ER
