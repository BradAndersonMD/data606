look at those nights here where where they have like the same gender proximity and then you look at clothes aside as I call I have more kills assistant I've Morsi is betta 15 in the early game Guardian kind of are they very good that you're the game it is the 15 + where it gets better on the immortal side of snippy can use his incredible better experience with a patient Immortals I think he'll bounce back from this to a start that took down TSM just last week they can do good things here against Golden Gardens I could have been a 6 and 14 right now they are forced inside of playoffs top 8 make it The Mortals currently alone in Latin need to pick up with at least two to get into the playoffs yeah we'll see exactly how they're going to continue forward a but it has to be said that they have had a much better performances sense actually swapping in know that last game that we just sawreplay of against Golden Gardens that was the first time they played with this new roster they won that game they then went on to lose four straight but admittedly three of them were gets incredibly difficult opponents E90 l e g a wintzer event btsm with a platy how close they play TG clothes do they have been much more competitive I think down the stretch since swapping this team despite your being still tune forward this Rod Stewart on incredibly impressive record but they've been competitive with top teams and honestly in both its yell at me from actually winning and it was them making the mistake that actually cost in the game but something I want to talk a little bit about with the Guardians is no people talk a lot about their early game and it really can has been good but I also think part of the reason is many of those game they're drafting so heavily towards early game when you look at the early games in the split going through things like Natalie and Jason just like all in on winning Lane and that is where they are establishing sometimes these big gold leavesand you do as a result when you play those outcomes that are full early game you have to be able to close quickly right so your cough might get you a gold leaf it doesn't necessarily win you the game though and we seen that time again to where maybe you know you can get it if you could do that more and get over the line I think about him could have done that but yeah you get 25 35 minutes and will the compass now weaker so if you don't have to go anymore there's no coming back into it we are to the shop the quarterly pick on a Fella's FBI puts out of damage overall 31 has a damaged hair very high for a bot Lane it's 4% of what I asked me through no surprise or two coming through no surprise alarm is on take Duty quite a bit 33 gardenside May well be a top encounter could also be a chunk of a closer look forward to mate I think it is something that you know maybe a little bit nerve-racking for Mortals I do think they goGuardians and allow their wins has been due to side lamp late husband due to global play making on I think it's BF is one of the big enablers of that they looks good when they have the doctor and they look good with that the TF and just weighs kind of spread them a try to Happy's kind of obvious go buttons Immortals you're very obviously drafting 40 fighting for later stage of the game you have a double front line with trundle just read through any of the front liner the Golden Gardens does pick they're going to Banning away the Olaf the fall of beer is in Italy grazes take out the table so a lot of these kind of guitar picks for closer are getting banned away they may be trying to push him toward something like the least in that are comfortable giving bad over because clothes are has been one to off and pick you know Natalie Graves full off those types of Champions to really get those big early goal please send fan here in case that set isn't going into the jungle I think it's been the best look for closer so far in the LPS to split is on the lease and there's the bandAaron golden Guardian save a fair bit as Oriana and a zero off the table Corky's Zoe and syndra round up a chance that it's going to be played in the ALCS itself down go to go to the one final band to be a support to be intimate could still just be closer playing set jungle that is a possibility I'll be staying for five of the six Champions black cougars play this would have been banned the only one that's not actually band is binocular in which they did say again 59 you could function well with the TF so is a possibility yeah I like a massive Buffett n14 I was wondering when we're going to see it come through the bus to Jungle overall responded the bus to the lanes because there's a do they do well and a drop off on the Q but I like my listen to it you still directly if you can match that yourself that said it's going to have to be taughtit was getting played at all I have seen a possibility all right it's closer play Gangplank counter pick top of your business Alice's baby just saying like I wish we could pick this cuz a lot of different was pretty weak now so that is probably there at their main concern I mean you could have done something like what that jungle that place I was off I think that could have been if I answer cuz I was actually a totally good matchup into the warrant I think that's a very comfortable that that is actually where I would have liked to see them go if they wanted to go that route what time was top pick whatever support you want that goes jungle and there's 4 ultimate that are incredible to steal nowcomplete the name game for Silas the only thing missing is like mouth like mouth I didn't like the Phil Holy Grail of all this this is this the guy you like yeah unlucky Immortals I like this Insanity by the way has been getting really good damage numbers so far in the LCS I would like them on dammit baby car that is one of those I think this incredibly incredibly strong very good pick overall they've got Ash Morgan which is a great bottom Lane I think it completely screw the board wants to do kind of all times you got a lot of folks got a lot of sustained pushing down the lane with trundle for a Smithy we know he's going to that one you got or an engagement, which really solid I mean there's lots of ways for them to engage is also a lot of ways to make it easier to hit the skull shots to engage you have the wall of pain slope of the pillar slow those both sound very well for or Nolte as well as a Sheltie even binding to be very hard to dodge if you're on top of a trundle pillar lots of ways for them to start the fight I do think of your fighting front-to-back they should have the advantage it's going to be very difficult for some of the Champions actually fight through the carthus passive no carpet is charging in there with orn on top and and champions in that mix it becomes so difficult for your back line to access their backline I will say there is some kind of some kind of planet of the side and you got more. Who can black shield a gold card if he and sit on the other you can just bar don't your teammate when they go for the car this record in court that well cuz we know TF might want to pick it up at some point so get out make sure you time those probably but that should be doable with the coordination is a lot of fun stuff can happen here in this game I do like Gangplank we've seen Gangplank how to make a Resurgence here in the LCS he's been really solid overall we saw who have a bad early game into a masterful mid-to-late game last week CLG day you stood in got wrecked and then went great in the mid-to-late gate like GP does a lot there's a lot of little bar Jeep ETF like they're going to get in there pretty good fight but right as long as you're actually be able to slow down to the soul snowballing or not just go of every single Dragon you can play Sidelines with TF TF joining up with GP new GPU vaulting bot Lane then TF Alton Alton 242 you could stop these types of situations very effectively carthus does answer somewhat you know if DF old somewhere car this can all to help out that fight and try to swing in your favor a bit but I do think they're having a good ability to play the map it's is going to be perhaps harder to execute than one world has drafted yeah here we are on our last game of the day 6 Immortals 2 and 8 just on the outside of the playoff Four Winds right now is a place with hundred do you still having one to play Africa's well that could improve the five an immortal game to play must win at least to most likely to win three or four they got to go about fifty-fifty over the back half of the split if they want a plant that is my prediction here we'll see if they can do that it is an uphill call for them go to college right now are in position although as a Losi to make the difficult we'll see how they can do I think improving so if they have to walk back to the wait someone's going to face check them what sorry they're going to find hawkmoon versus CC more damage across close to me but low and they got to be respectful now cuz closer to help checking the potions Golden Gardens of course able to easily run back to their own side of the map no problem but there's a deep word for immortals and closer you don't have to recall here right but you're still at happy to be coming at you through the jungle is it going to start topside I think that's the answer you know that there's a ward left are you don't really know know if they're going to stay around and grass you so he doesn't mediately went out for the topside GP will help lecia Emmylou he should be fine. Machete so he wants the books on the Singletary can't obviously while you do start dating time for second goal but you know he can't even just do something like like blue and then Robin and red and be perfectly happy to try to recall off that you know maybe you have to boil your smile a little bit earlier but we'll see where he does decide to go that has taken on who wants to go to drop or not there will there be easier nice little hit their from hot to a pig give me something I have to burn to heal early so that was a close one there at the end of the day some of those FBI has to walk back to lay in The Mortals are crushing so far did I crave finding just the one binding be enough air from Jaco he has been such a good Morgana player throughout his career it's been awhile since he's brought it out but you know that they were one of the bottom Lance Vaccaro who is love playing we're going to Caitlin for example you hasn't answered his Ira Khan and things like this and they have always been very solid at that that one Vine not only forces FBI back to base take your to and Apollo is 13 cold to poop so pretty good about that so I will stay and help and help scaling of a squishy before that change anyway he's actually getting doran's blade help for free so always get a life skill item for a crushing ruin takes you have lifesteal you have they sell coolers just 453 think the only riskier is is what happening now if you get Yankees versus unhealthy are in Halo has no flash notification go off at once again closer finds ways to make the early game go well the jungle different standing about laying is Apollo a taco or wanting that to be too but a good gang cure comes through from closer to start the Doctor Who how to find the latch on the wall didn't matter if they're just random down and I'm not sure if it would have made any difference for Apollo Taxi heal from Ruth b c everything made the judgement call that he wasn't getting out either way just decided to hold on to that he also accepting the death he's returning back to make sure the hawk will work it out but thankfully for him even on farm and the kill went to the sets you're going to be happier about that than if it went the way of your fellows I'm ready for the game State 500 gold lead to Golden Gardens I will say they have to Champions who print money the other pastimes to go to the Monte and Hans were going to have inflated gold values vary slightly golden okay this is what team is playing better than winning because they're doing more in this case go to grab the gold leave because their Champions are bounced around just printing free money so it will lie a little too few Yep this is one of those things that you say it like that that's the key part is that it's balance around having having extra gold right though you know being being up under gold on the TF when your family even is more like saying you're kind of even in power but either way they doing that first blood in her to be happy about that know we'll see how much is for an alarm to pick up in the Top Lane but it was good good early Laney face you're from the orange unless you really miss play on GP it can be pretty difficult for orange punish you whatsoever and if you can't punish GP in the really early roles then it's pretty tough when she pees on shein and start getting some of them for the bear where do you completely control that way it's definitely the case right here and whatever you want to take the recall he is easily got Sheen money this point in time they see we ever was going to have around 1,300 gold from all the farming roles we can see who's came through for the Monte extra couple of rings came through for Insanity on their first three calls see how long they want to wait until the first things do come through on to Big Lots of burn through this man a fool eat the bear oh there it looks pretty heavily damaged down he's going to get us how far back regardless so it doesn't do too much that's okay can discredit back and forth as the business clear there waves in V1 see a difference here in the mid lane 4748 plays on the map Insanity just wants to sit here and farm and he wants to keep the TF locked under his turret so if you're able to do that on the spot just got out of the all but one more cute actually would probably meant you could die there would have been a lot closer for sure the month did Russia Mercury traits we has the
