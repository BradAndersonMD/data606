today is very exciting as we talked about during countdown house away hundred thieves one is often like the way a mortal's has one so we could be in for a rather Wild game excited as you get around a victim because I knew that I should but right now the six wins is the fly off bar 6 wins as we're six places and these are two teams at that point right now hun disease that is very hit in this season so far to got to come back when I get stickers off yesterday and with the win over a mortal fear to a weekend since it's going to be a Hitman season so I can hit a lot to start and then they have been waiting for since that point right now I was wondering if there's going to be a step dad because I feel likeI am in which players have kind of stood the test of time and which one actually met with expectations right here to show the veteran status flight game wins have been really exciting vacations where are worse than LeagueI think that would be quite a statement game for him in terms of a cover fry almost wanting someone to stand out it's also a new strategy we're seeing here for the last week they actually put Apollo into para Taco Bell where they played most of the split with Altec and your kind of wondering whatever teams going to do after that often times it has been Ezreal with Kev plays to lose lean gracefully here most played in most punctual Champions all time so if you're looking to it's not the game one statement come back but coming in here at The Mortals running out of time to make that last final push before the game to speak they're looking pretty solid I will push on upward then I think I'll call it the definitely do that we got a chocolate toppingWillis played split it was actually picked away from him yesterday by Hootie and he ends up going Renekton but he's just looking to make this game wide open it it has been known as I want to say like with quotation mark a counter picks to aatrox but it's still very volatile nothing. I am date rocks which is why they try to still go off in like it well. So what else do you want to split post it was the reasons they stopped a lost streak when they beat to seal a meal for him so we'll be looking at so as looking at his watch the gate at the back line as well he's going to be so far the plan watch for me in this game I mean they're also pairing it was on level 11 basically has a goal so is this game does breaks down I think hundred thieves needs to do to be very diligent in these last two pics to make sure that they haveeither a very strong answer for Camille X Kenshin side or really reliable initiation so that when people do split a way they can just run down didn't win table sadly as well as Mortals are the ones who have banned away trundle I know we had the analysts talk about a Z-Wave trundle in and have that go well that's the bunch of us a map with multiple get first dibs on Champion texting we are usually expecting that to be done Google is it here in Corky trade banned from the 20 trade bands and go to the Pentagon supply store can I buy fish Rekha yeah I see the cinder already being banned a lot of time LeBlanc and be blind picture here it would generally fit with The Mortals hit and run strategy if it's company make it comfortable playingthat's the hover yep and locked in his first leblanc's game of the year going to play us lately different style it doesn't mean that they have a lot of fact Line-X I will come a point that one out in the back line the block and follow through there is queue does something over the top as well so I can definitely split and pick and 100 thieves is building towards us team of Team fighting who is Joey I'm not Super Soul Bond but there's also a lot off the table right now I think Garvin might be the younger that you want to go for Four Strong initiation Zach also is just stronger Jarvan play Jarvan but late-game big-time initiator back taxesplay seven games I can play season 2 this is what he goes to time and time and time again going to have sex or damage that down there and if in a truck funny but it does mean that you're relying on you know why they think a process for an outlet for your heart Broadway yai next if he ends up having old one but it does extremely well with over Blanc in terms of Ganga tip I find it interesting actually how generally speaking you do want a damaged difference in damage pipe between your jungler in the soul in your primary thank you for still like ragesh Joey isn't as great because of a walk had something like summer trades are Apaches field target has killed but this says hey he wants to go top way to gank for the eighth rock where is Smithy compositionally will actually pair with the LeBlanc and trying to Camp Midland so you trying to have that big game in midlane the jungler pics compliment that the year 4 x 53 fun to see if you can make it happen right here as time ticks down no surprises really in Tampa before it leaves on those flares Camille to me still a bit of a delay filthy a ton of her but that's always fun to beat regardless how to season the Mortal who is wearing off on the rip these off of win from yesterday but it was a tough one there early games has traditionally been very very weak but they found a ways back in 6 in 7 is roughly in Plymouth right now supposed to be in piloting The Mortals as well as elves I've done just as good of a job team's ability to have these late game situations where the game kind of starts losing structure and then they find their way on top what would be kind of fitting for this game is if it's just like a total slam stuff at all but like there's a lot of things that can break open this game there's High volatility Lanes on the side of a mortal so I'm looking forward to it rain. Fun game to watch we are on 800 portal search battles here five games play County in front of Thieves fix left for immortals and which were the teams of stacked up going tonight at 9 I feel like I'm going to get you in the playoffs now real quick yeah real quick it had to get some words from you nauseous after the game yesterday but going into a very important one because it seems to be understood that you need the 202 try make playoffs of thing do you agree with that has like every game at this point matters a lot to do with only five games remaining you know one game can always be the difference so we're putting our best into every single game individually and just you know striving for the store that considered considering there's a lot of back line by Potential from Immortals in this composition what are you leaning on most with a hundred things composition to try and go against that account I kind of like just hold his own well so as long as we learn it well around like preventing their flank I think we should be fine this game yeah I think you just elaborate on what you're saying is what we were saying a Champion Select where hundred thieves at a certain point in this game is just to be trying to group up and hold the zones well so they can move two objectives so they can move to a church so they can move to Baron and it's going to be about King painting show us in most of this game Sunday is it still safe enough as they fly around their respective cooldowns what damage goes back and forth is a cuz also fear the country right now against the real quick red to blue 450 Gracchus doing blue drops is going to stay longer but the one that was rescued from the bottom side it'll be bought Lane push 2400 Eastview level 2 coming very soon will see to get a double up hope just yet. So you might always trying to look at the wording Till There was a ward place that the Raptors so basically xmithie would be a little bit suspicious the progress will be trying something like stealing the Raptors but the fact that he hasn't shown as of yet people dresses for clearing blue side and they can probably surmise it it may be confirmed any second and he walked over records another Noah's he walks around he goes for his Red Bluff here so information gathered is meteos is finishing his side's the clearest half a can see right now we're supposed to take down the Wolves so I just really low impact early game by a small fee of Cleveland area slaying so that's being ways being pushed though so did you get most of it whenever I'm doing a clear liked videos. Before going off your boss is always the sense of relief when the other Junger hasn't gotten it yet but then you go by and we'll see what happens here quite land with anything but so as actually with the early topside push I really do enjoy things like that were you able to run down to the top river is. It's got a problem or not or if someone wants to go from self usually this early the Scuttle crab will definitely go over to the jungler he's really benefiting more from the bonus experience he gets from his jungle item for killing jungle camps really early on and you don't want your jungle have a level disadvantage this early cuz that can actually just egg left top laners being with one Creek offside level 480 is important chatous for getting physically bleaching at least the red very hard for you but at least we'll have to save in like 5 Seconds second time around so you know if you do that to me what are you doing 50 TV schedule for you okay he didn't steal it yeah well actually asked him if he does need to go up here with the wave looking towards him as still as if somebody wants to get this wave in and not have it frozen on him he's got to be risky that's what that word is for so immediately has to fall away and there's a good chance this way you could actually freeze if it goes aggressive as his jungers arriving so really good pulling up like the gravity of toppling anyways early doing the record player really can't expect that rush or the area transit bus was boarded without me being there either way like they always provide information like they do the horses are in the butt. I saw a really decent damage here he's thinking about trying to kill threat use your butt do I still have to get up some gold someday yeah so to have a hard time here live it looks like we'll have to see in a replace it looks like so as cancel the fatal auto hopefully we can slow down Landing for someday but so as did walk him down in Detroit what a close by I am excited as a little way if you don't get that about covers born I appreciate something going for it we'll see if it was mechanical display or not now that is Flash teleport is downloaded game can be even more disastrous for that lane that video so kind of sits up there to make sure that someday can get something to eat. He's already going to happen again yea threatened to fold I fear that works really fast jet okay go let's let's try and watch so as is auto attack so he lands a w he knows that you're so I'm guessing he gets dressed at a chart range and then still has thought the picture was going to kill so he was already backing away when he flashes and he can't get the next Auto off its the term Integra dropping that's Russo as off I think before his back with you he he missed the first Auto regardless I mean One auto to kill for sure because you were there and that is abandoned Sunday Augustine I still love you and a 20 ft Ashley didn't you know this game could be very chaotic snowballs Patrol I mean another solo kill for Sunday I think he's already among the lead League leaders in Solo killed a lot of people remember when he's solo killed impact 3 times in the atrox Gangplank matchup as the atrox earlier in the season the technically was a solo kill in the Top Lane just now so he's already up to one and look at that CVS discrepancy as well as getting to replace I mean how do you deal
