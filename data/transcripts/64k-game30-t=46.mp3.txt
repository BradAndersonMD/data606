a very good draft beer on a to be able to set themselves up for success in a team that has been pretty intelligent as far as the drafting goes into in North America we have seen a time with them they need opponents need to take gate consequently things like the swing that has been discussed with him in the past I think they're going to need that they're also going to need a very good performance out of solo who I think has been performing much below his level at Worlds you know I did not expect him to get abused in the way that he has been he's been making some unforced errors making some mistakes I think that he is a strong solid player he is normally pretty good on the weak side and I think that he's going to have to hold up better than he has been in the first two games because power of evil put on I-4 Road performance yesterday to help them over you as well but you can expect I think the same level of dominance from power of evil over someone like chovy who is truly what are the greatest militaries in the worldwith the facts jungle is a second overall of all players has been quite strong in the jungle of course that's no surprise we watch that flag with unicorns of Love Game very clearly he was the one doing all of the hard work into that game and swim at world twenty20 so at the W want to see him step up now a lot of teams were banned the Caitlin away from death and him and carry a plane aggressive on the bottom side of going to be exciting ignore not at McDon titillating pay that there are solid they're okay but the strength of ignore on this composition is the fact that he will try to Rome out of the lane that part to do with a Caitlin Carver something turtle and ignore have been quietly having quite a good performance bright do they weren't dominant with the MF was critical in yesterday's when a turtle I think you know they were they were actually Tradingcall GameStop in the early stages almost got to be to kill their of course did not and then I ran over by top but I have been solid how they're going to have to have a really good performance here I do like the answer of the Kindred into the graves I think that you know this is one of those jungle matchups were where were paycheck the other one is going to lose but Kendrick can actually out scale an outrage the graves especially post for Mark's you start to really get the advantages you just have longer range from the graves and Graves Kimberly struggle I think to fight in team fight against some of these longer-range Marksman Kaitlyn in addition to a kindred is going to make it tough for him to close a gap when you start getting more items in you take one or two before you close the range and you're all the sudden not able to fight anymore it's great that Caitlin with the Luxe in there for the dueling that is an extremely dominant to be too and as you said ignore likes to go more for the engagement play for the five and five I think that you could get very heavily punished if you try to go to the something like a wreck on again because if you lose the push against Caitlin and Lux they will sayscraps of one side of your Tower field drop a Lucent Singularity that lucky on the other side and it becomes nearly impossible to farm in between all the sudden become so tough self I would like them to prioritize their to be to a little bit but I think spells good things that has been doing so well at world and picnic here allows an out a couple potential difficult for them if they want to try to protect solo but it's going to be some good scaling for them and Elaine we're still do might take a little bit of a beating but he's always going to be useful skill Shakira on the Kindred that is the origin of his actual screen name in Korean a Mark that it would be for Kindred is ketchup to pick up Summer split on purpose but it's cool that he gets his namesake here in this game in the de-facto battle for second place in this group yes they were rematch in we2 where we all know how the LCS fares theresay hey there's no thank you very clever band with that set but aren't there other than that you've got the right you can have some other driver and a galio coming through I can do things like that you can also even go like Shan and N even play something along the lines of a perhaps a Statin did I we've seen that quite a bit actually come out in a from Jovi music very proficient on that champion how we can see things like even chenin Blanc are there are a lot of options here I'll be your sissy where they do go looks like it is going to be a narf playing the Romans 2:4 going for this Pantheon I do worry for there to be too I think this is somewhat difficult you do if you lose the push and I and I think pantana's going to have trouble actually an amazing that I think you probably pushno matter what and what you're going to play, but trap on purpose and put up the shield and the duration to be about as long as you're busy with Stampy and tire combo and play hyper aggressively and I also agree I love maokai I think there is a wealth of Top Lane tanks if people don't play but they're outstanding maokai definitely in the downings absurdly strong should have no problem and I want to see how good and this is one of those things even Poppy I think has a lot of room to come into the meta Champions that are being kind of overlooked people are looking at Warren and Chene and sometimes malphite and kind of just forgetting about the rest of the tanks yes Warren does have an advantageous match up into maokai especially in the early game how you are to have very good trading into the Malachi utilizing the Bellows breath being able to get those girl products on Malachi but that being saidif you get past those very early stages about the damage anymore you know you have a sap magic to be able to feel through that and trade you can Farm it out you point and click DC that is going to help to set up for the engage very very effectively you can utilize the ultimate Apple doesn't engage Builder also honestly as you drop the ultimate as you're moving forward to study done a tower and makes it really tough for a team to then stay on that power to try to defend or chip it down a lot of ways to play that out on the other side power people playing one of his signature Pixies on the Oriana very well known for all of his kind of a typical bills that he was going at 3 on the Comfort scaling made you have form for the top site allows the law to sit back and I think a lot of his game is going to depend on both how people hack hold up a little late but also most importantly the bottom line I really do think is going to be where we see a lot of contentionI definitely agree I want to put all my eyes down on the DRX pot Lane see how well does deplin carrier can do this is maybe the single strongest deal you can pick in League of Legends right now it's very hard Upon A 212 that will beat this heads-up yeah you might win and other places obviously the utility is far higher when you have Pantheon semi Global in cages and Advil across the map yes indeed but the two on Tulane play the lcf is spending to world he is absolutely outstanding and if he can have one of those from game that he had domestically than that of the possibility and so we'll see what comes through this one as we are on the summoner's rift as we open up game 3 of the day dear ex and fly plus are fighting for second place in the group right nowso as always with Kindred you are going to have to track them marks it as I can make a pretty big difference if you get lucky and have the marks pond on the schedule that you kind of have control of or not one thing that you will see some experience Kendra players do is if the marks on the other side of the map to actual just try to delay taking the Scuttle and try to force that to actually spawn on their Scuttle than later on and And Delay that but you have to make sure then you are controlling a Quadrunner the map and that you can't get double pedal by the grave so there is some risk associated with in it also is falling down at the gold and experience that you would expect to be kind of injected in thereall right now no chaotic invades we have seen so many of these games opened up with a lot happening in the first minute half the game this one is going to be one of the most docile there is at most a gboard coming down from solo soaring saying alright I'm going to see if I can figure out work and it's starting all right but has not been touched at 1:31 I think we're good to go to Bentley Trickett at the exact same time that will almost assuredly track any invade Shenanigans weather Santo and does that or pioszak but it's going to be a pretty heavy clear he wants to do red and blue red blue in control. Talk about and then it really comes down to look who's going to get the first hitthis one away sweeper will kill the War II it allows sand turn to be tight this into the brush ignore still sticking around chovy its first move as well and he's got to have to be Mia has to be called finding dodged away from well played on the invade Terrier shows up that shows up trophy shows up for me to is just not fair even leasing the grand Pier for p060a lot of emphasis to putting this Kindred ahead because as I said the Kindred does outscale the grades when you get that range of comes very advantageous you can actually get ahead of the Grave early because incredibly difficult for the grace really have much effect on this game I like the patient's there from DRX you know they had that Rome from the bottom but that was smashed by ignorance really smart and he's straight oververy least get this and the Scuttle on the top side has a mark so we should be able to take the blue deny that Scuttle away and being a pretty reasonable spot here given the fact that there was that many resources to try to put them behind and you talked about how good thing tour in is a lot of credit for his intelligence in his passing is very smart he's adaptable he has good game plans with their malleable he's not just going to hard commit to I must do this path every game he had just based on what is happening in the game this is a good example of that I think pretty smart stuff from him to really not end up very far behind e-chords did steal away to camps to the one stolen of sand for those who in bottom Scuttle goes who directs there's still no extra pants off for Pilchuck long as we are going down. But we'll still see what comes through as they junk cars are fairly close an overall can't count as they're dropping down she'll take him down to the bottom side and he's going to wait until he knows top scuttles been killedtake a note to all wait till it marked bottom side then take Scuttle the tiny Toby pretty soon you can see show be heading down that way as well give me free easily taking the first Marquez long is Joseph was long enough to see if he does want to wait for that just seemed like he is so just getting it low and then actually delaying finishing it does always make a pretty big difference getting that first Mark we could getting a forest Okie every Marcus helpful because you're just getting additional damage on your spells every time but the first four is the biggest one that's where you get that really big range increase every 3 thereafter is nice and they're going in they find us something to find some damage areas are there sharks in the Flashjungle Gangstar how you make this batch of work and first blood comes through know how long the next. That's a picture app that sees a damage has been touring but flight was needed a life went out of the bottle and they found it here very well done that is one way you can punish this type of way because the way they get the advantages is with the push if you don't have your opponent under the tower as Caitlin wachs it's a lot harder to get a lot of damage down that I actually like the TRX had the recognition that alright Carrie is dead now let's minimize loss know he'll use no exhaust use they try to hold on as much as they can on the other side with a flash from Synthroid ignite from a narc cleanse is out from Turtle I'm so they did get the extra resources of course it's still a great play from flyquest but this is pretty smart stuff and pretty patient stuff from dear ex not overcome it was already losing Play It's because Mark stop throwing for a boots Rush here is that I could swing are 3 on 3 kariya is behindthat's so good thoughts out that it going to be in the brush does you know my Spidey senses tingling and for a seventeen-year-old Miss first-year competitive play that's been important one beautiful stuff out of Hanuman black West don't get to punish the in the jungle irizarry-colon pants always do centaurs got that one because Derek needs engage somewhere and so far st. Pete ain't no prompt replies toppling I mean I think that and he is in a good match up and he's going to be comfortable there and honestly going for it you should never get likes solo killed or really have an enormous DS difference in defensive matchups unless there is tremendous jungle interference it should just be a farming out style and I think that's a little will be very happy with that does scale effectively but there is quite a bit of damage and we'll see if they do pick up any sort of healing debuff because a lot of the tankiness from now, you have to remember actually comes from his passive the stop magic where you are getting backHealth you're based on the Spells you use and it spells you've been hit by it recharges that Passavant especially if you get into a spirit visit can get some ridiculous healing from that so we will see and when they pick up any sort of things like an executioner Resort or something help mitigate that going to be claimed so halfway there the first Big Range upgrade Ezekiel on this control work here is well and temporarily 83 Camp leads to Biarritz jungle with both back and forth and out there cuz Greaves Turtle feels pretty safe vs Ortho for Daft is a yeah we are actually win the 2002 like you got a taxi and you can stop us.
