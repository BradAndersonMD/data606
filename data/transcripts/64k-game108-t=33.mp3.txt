put the ball in Hunters Court allow him to get counterpick allowed him to look for slow push or do something because goldenglue as well as the bot Lane they have been significantly behind it feels like they are getting outclassed in this Siri and Golden Gardens is going to need to really make something up if they want to have a chance to come back feels like the strength for Golden Gardens lies in roughly two spots it's closer to being an incredible jungler who is good A Team fight again taking over a fight The Landing phase. So much gold the guardian strength but giving him a backline team fight like a failure Suites by the waist and everything okay at 2 to find your liking damage and and it was okay that kind of worked out the problem was all the gorilla game stats against losing the weight. You choose the side because they lost games you say shows red they wanted red side, but you have to believe they're champ select plans were in place to stay and it's interesting right you know you can go rest high but then you're going to blame pick your top liner anyway after a kind of pass work out a couple times in a row yesterday truck is a strong blank pic was very clear did this kind of housing through working giving over-the-counter octans to Blacklist they will have the ability to kenefick mid lane tier if they do so choose to Golden Gardens don't do that in the first round in Odyssey Blacklist expect him to dinner prep rental matchups against cinder cone board is going to be against in Turin playing and solo CT wish I was felt like I was his best Champion when he had been a Mainstay in the ALCS in previous years he have been really really strong on the GP very consistent player so I'm going to be a Guardians Matt's jungle or midir yeah and it's going to be looking like matching jungle the Olaf however that is going to be locked in so we have some decent option C we've been answered mid laner and unanswered. We know Sandra can be flexible what are the big things to talk about with Sandra Lee counterfeit cat and this is something that will you still have Guardians are on bedside they can still wait till 5th to do it later if you're willing and throw play this year and we'll see with him. But I am expecting in quite some time he's been pretty regularly just sticking to your Marksman and kind of going for that song also some pot Lane Focus pants here come out from Golden Guardians and it is Nautilus as the takeaway perhaps thinking that you don't like what if they want to go for a lower Mobility Mark Smith and they don't want to have that Nautilus paired alongside the various which gives you a really strong Ellyn scraps are trying to push them to work them constantly more defensive options fresh also does signify that they're not worried about anything that goldenglue can bring out they want to take away from the good aggressive pairing that Ferris does a bush golden Guardians 2 playlist it more expensive I think on that bottom Lane which to me is telling telling me that fly and utilize that in the Sandra takeover Nora Midland kill the move to the sidelines and not necessarily have to babysit theft Autumn Lane by Benny Boyd threshing Nautilus forcing out something like this Braum's yes there are two boxes there but it's not the same sort of reliable engage that something you're like this Nautilus or fresh could bring Waka Flocka okay well I'm exactly that's why I quit hovering LeBlanc what is your hike down bear flyquest 1700 e on the bot Lane Dudley syndrome Pike we weren't sure what any of it was going to be it also means that don't Guardians have very very few aggressive engaged to a soaked in comes the Spy list to steal some kind of Engagement and maybe start things off with various lines and arrow or Silas you do steal the pantheon in this is the same idea how do you say ginger doesn't have a dash to be very susceptible to all ends from somebody's hook South Champions Lake Drive to Nautilus so. It's been using that and they do have to ignore again on a playmaker we had some really good on this throughout the year one of his biggest I think strength is his Champion flexibility there's a lot of initial upfront Bearse on this squad now when you have LeBlanc when you have syndra these are such a what is just need to get somewhere to 20% so that Pike can dunk come and start that fight off on the right foot if you can get that first reset Pike can completely take over a fight and they do have a lot of ways to get that initial burst out to get someone low to set up ignore Force except in this fight alrighty well we are on the Ritz Cancun final game of the best-of-five flyquest had a fight of a first game win but absolute Slaughter of GameCube including goldenglue playing stylist here in the mid laners they are going to walk by a horde of us invaded in dark and very cleanly walk away from it all right it is also a hail of blades on the Pike a lot more of recently allowed Pike to have the ability we hook someone didn't wear when you start them look at these kind of three quick Autos out to have more of front damage feel to try to get someone in to sq range and friend that will all in Patrol he wrote The Flash they found that first to make it happens that would that was pretty floppy from Turtle they knew they were there and he just kind of wandered up anytime you have Brahmin these level 1 invades you got to respect the Q if Brom Q hits and that passive stun get sprach as it did you were going to go down and her was unable to flash a bronc you unable to flash a stylist just really way too late on the summary of usage and as a result stats first blood not only given over to Golden Gardens but give it over to FBI yeah usually important right here we saw a level 1 level 2 diver the bottom five and centering game this time around though to be fair FBI is also Flash and so here it is he gets slowed up by the band tag by the Bronx you vent a golden blue sun and golden flashes in for that auto-tune rock that prompts unlock the team actually flashing and finish that up very nicely done now looking to set this up there pretty close to Tower but remember there is no flash available and we'll just load and yeah just a little bit then right there when is farming heavier you stole the chickens find the X backwards this isn't a pretty big world of hurt they got ignored flashing night but he does nothing that should turn and walk away closer basil I've ignored left alone Gallade Turtle can't be back as Lane and he can cash in on the way things for him if they can do it takes a bunch of shots and he won't lose too much he didn't even lose the cat that they actually were able to complete it down there but still all credit deserve to your five golden Guardians a really great start Turtle makes the initial mistake getting over First Blood being down that Summoner and then they realize there was not able to get to level two prior to that dive coming in he was Trump's very low so he couldn't do a lots of support turtle and turtle without that Flash doesn't have another defensive summer they have no heel down there there's no exhaust down there so it's easy to get that damage down and take him out and now you know no flash no TP his base only netted him a fairy charm obit danger who he thinks he has the shield still and try to keep the wave away from the trip delay house is going to kill that down my gold grabs done for FBI only a fairy charm for recall timing me the FBI is far stronger than pretty sad when you have a 125 gold fairy charm vs Goldberg pretty rough stuff there for turtle but we'll see if you can actually just kind of skill it out and thankfully he is going to change in the house of very good way of clearing can play Ghost early defensively he is going to go back and just grab them in a crystal and boots and it was able to push it in so of a spot as previously what and meanwhile Top Lane midlane both going great yes there is quite a bit of farmed for pickups wait and see exactly how it had sold his butt 38 cs221 temporarily is a monstrously 4GB he gets the first dates on his Sheen which is really such a nice scenario at the TV anytime you are playing that. It comes with your dreaming about and also POV and I was going to have some minions pick up and be a little bad there too the text defines a Sunday. Can't find that one now Andrea gave them away as well as well and was completely would not midline fight not a problem at all 140f for men mid therefore flyquest we didn't the FBI make that room so they had the extra member show up and were able to get that kill ignore barely surviving and now can look through actually threatened again hear a Serta love even gets back to bought Lane to pick up the wait so he really didn't lose much of anything maybe a minion on an initial Push by Turtles give me really happy about that room and these last couple minutes here despite a really poor start is black with again battling back and showing their Superior landing and in the soul you put on right now you looking at another but I find a way in a few weeks until it will be covering things up and go grab first rake the first time of the series that is something on the board for them to go to Guardians win this is starting out like what it really is this is by far their best start that they have had you know looking pretty good I need early minutes driving dragon going to be nice and we will see how long does stair going forward again solo officer and put the early Tabby to unfairly offensively makes a lot of sense when you are up against not only the GP but also the pantheon who can come in there that's going to make things you do more difficult for them to be able to afford taking him down but at the same time anytime you're expecting too much Armour there's a possibility of swapping things over and putting POV in that side lane again sponsor maybe they can answer that already well chicken clamp cleared out closer is a couple of cancer has also managed to gain a little more than his opponent has easy first blood level one closer playing defensively in his no-hitter defend against then he should be fine just to get rid of that vision and keep the farm going but it was location of trade flows back and forth solo knows that Olaf is somewhat nearby and may have to be respectful of that think that wants to do is Stand Out The Wave enough so that it doesn't just straight-up crash on his without killing so many minions that is going to push away from because keeping the wave right about where it is now is pretty much as safe as you can be on GP means that Olaf really has no option acceptable on committee for a dive Style gang and hear your ear not going to really be in much danger so it kind of a concert and it's awkward situation the guy looking right at the mid lane as it is a Farley for power people ignore lurking around as well location relatively known dog sound effects to know that someone is stealth nearby outside who he is too much of a little bit look for something else to do and no olvida steel just yet it's almost back to school that's a ward it back and close out this midlane goldenglue and the Restless as they are pushed in the Midway over there once again going for a first hail to CrossFit which all the games so far Golden Gardens bathhouse. Every single for sale people get one trip late for 3 people deny it but you was down here as well and probably get plate number to and if the Harold doesn't get more than two flight how much can you get out of it sometimes you get a kill into a Harold and then you not only get a pulsar it but eventually it will get a charge on a second. And then things could become really good looks like it has already gotten the outside if a lot of farm denied pending Hornet looking to take away this blue buff in the meantime but golden Guardians are moving back towards this bottom side and they're going to be a little bit careful about this working their way over here to the Port Colden blue alright almost of third plate thinking about us out of no one defense this it's missing one more wave to cash in on that third plate will see while to play defense
