Wishing by Edo can work out a price on that team like he's supposed to call play that he loves playing with their back together I mean CSM height to be very real but this is still binds to the very best teams in the week good game that I'm excited about some slight today Yeah by itself so are so many of you know of the older fans that have a lot of nostalgia and it have all those associations with the relationship that he talks about for all the players let's jump right into that though I mentioned the Calista Calista still has not found her way onto the band face Tavares is probably going to be Perma banned in my opinion should not get through because there's just way too strongright now and we go for one of the power pick the champion OCC ated with appearance in came over as first game even over in the ALCS so many Center plays for the sky and Amy Carey but on this team it's like a 99 to 1 flax where 99 is going to be rigged yeah yeah I would be surprised if you SS game on Sandra's it split it can happen it is worth doing but has not been typically all that gun made in his career and I think it's fine as Marketplace very good at it was very Spanaway you've got that is real that week because he's too often those are the most likely possibilities and if she wants a high price baby carried out is going to take it in the zoo this round picks right nowjust great. Glennon as well it's BSM I'll bring the Calypso it meant a lot of pressure down there that's what I'm looking for here for double with his vile were the reasons double it talk about it always enjoying playing with Ralph rottens how aggressive they can be in Lane Mac something that you really want to do when you pick up his Champion especially if you're going to stare down the barrel of what looks like the makings of a nice killing 14 liquid with both of values and I know you've got Terry scaling Frontline as well as read write what's the next ticket to be for TSM to round out the first round alright Terex going to come out alongside the callista so early priority down there and set up for a lot of sass then I got to say this is one of my most prized violin theater in the elf that they should have a good time and it's almost all teams what does court datedental office that Eric hick I like it going with a barge for harassment you can throw so much harassment Monica lista para clane's Advantage for a cellulose part is just so nice in the early stages you really do have to watch out for the Olive and another thing that goes along with you if they're picking to listen to Derek's is a lot for the team play to not just about to land because Calista gives you the play making opportunities the gold button in there and that are trying to layer his own done but also it gives you a way to make really good use of your territory, timing on the biggest difficulties with Heritage hiding. Immunity to actually have value during the teeth by enforcing your phone is to fight you and it was so cool so long way in solving that yeah definitely to be an important to watch for is the bands are coming throughyes I'm going to throw some Midland bands in to look at throwing some jungle bands be going to lose the Leeson and the Jarvan to fairly highly prized Champions Braves is gone so he wants to play a top of a farmer in little obvious go to but you look at it certainly kind of pitch to the DS to the Jungle full already with the frontal lobe the band supporting it and jungle everyone always talks about 50s and maybe even more difficult now with with adding SS another star to team on the map and with all these bands going towards speak a little bit more. You mentioned in the New Delhi I think I went to Goodwin Kendrick in my opinion is also quite couldn't do the Toronto but it just means you know I'm looking at the team I would like another front liner to go along with tarek 40th them so you know either going to be a broken plate Champion or speak of Champions we have yet to SDcramping for them stuff to your with the a deer pick up play output going to look really really nice to that got kind of there their physical match. I got the front line covered it means that the Top Lane getting really be gravy write this pump worked with the worst you can play that against blood flow through that ensures that broken Blaze not a threat or you can play when I left the group and even better and I love you lock it in the place of the National League probably not paid to do is exciting all the space yeah I got a lot of changes after the dark in toppling here and I really enjoy the lower cool down on the queue for cane because you that said ability is just so much for clearing campus also your Mobility for extra out play stuff and if we got a huge bus fare and they actually had to pull back on some of the cell fillings for Rost which is what I expect I'm about to transform into go after hitting melee Champions to get his red form Came Polly form really hard to pull off in specially if I throw play and and I did give you a lot of taking a 5 of bility but I personally go so well with no Calista are the Stations of stuff but that's the world we live in a world qualifying weed so he will always have not won a fiddle my very first Main in League of Legends so soft spot for that champion For Me jeans are there more to Kaiser in the toppling here for Team Liquid should a very good interactions and what are composition if you can hold him before the fight starts or early enough you can't give it to me and vulnerability and you saw what are most accurate are coming out of damage Champion that's going to feel really good and that pic is pretty useless yeah love trying to think intelligently about breaking compositions with mordekaiser because you get your one do you want but more importantly you break synergies of the enemy team know like that that you me grabbing one where you can make your pop her off for not letting the yolk illicit Eric work together any sort of surgery that you can break their to it really adds Extra Value to the pic in addition to it being a strong one P1 top laner yeah definitely strong overall so I feel like we've got time to fill here before we have to start the game is this week as we broadcast the games on a delay for everything it still feels like we got a very sort of obvious team fight composition here on the team liquid side tactical is set up with a ton of supporting cast members of the bot Lane it's going to get it done right because Calista Atlanta fellios but Bart outlines tarek and so is this 212 is it should have lived volatile where all the nerves to affiliate with the course of time to finally drop him from them Spartan Pro plays for the first time since he's been really released to the world they have been consistently to his early game output his early game healing is worse or the ganzfeld images lower exact same time he's been since almost forever so you know the weakness is there in the early game and Calista is is poised to defeat it but I got so excited for that pick up cuz it really does add that the extra Dynamic to this Lane and of course should be able to get off consistent harassment many times you have bought Frost Epping up as well so I'm really excited to see what what you can do with this pic and if core JJ gets off some of those really impactful bar drones one of the one of my biggest loves is what I'm at junkyard I have a Bard on my team getting some of those jungle invent help with getting the vision help with getting Midland gang soft that type of stuff even a bar just as soon as your your level six and trying to lend a tempered Vape even if fully commit to Elaine can have been a very big and real impacts and chords JJ is one of our support players that that has been highlighted over the years so many times for a lot of the other such a big twice yeah I definitely want to watch for the other side of the map right you've got you know speaker who's got I'm actually sorry he's got the cane and there was really exciting it used to be to help you only champion of the year and it was one of the people like I should want to play this one but I think it's actually a decent time to talk at length about wearing 10.8 Lake in Jungle camps are worth more experience than before and that can change player Behavior as well as Champion choices and how they play out in the game and came very good at farming because of the Q die menschen like that the cube off is the single the single biggest bot that can't have gotten in so long and it actually prompted that pull back a little nervous that they did to like we're talking about that that is always going to be true that his his farming is better now and like you're saying it's in a world where it where that is good plus if you're intelligent about getting the correct color orbs trying to get your red orbs so you can get your transformation to have your CC for your knock up with your W-2 have all this extra tankiness from the healing that you're going to get did you become a very very big factor in the team fights for your team and it's it's it's weird power Spike that not a lot of other jugglers have come when when can you have 2 transformation I kind of like how that changes the game and changes your your choices and what lanes are trying to go to as well you have a big fan of that one so yeah she's going to recap what what happens if you're saying something is very very good the typical Kane Builders three point q and then then you come back to the W so for the first 13 levels he's actually got a better cool down on cue then he would have rebuffed obviously that's all very very relevant you really look at is in those later levels though from a minute 15 on words when the drawing was about level nine and then and then put us the game these camps are worth more experience and it was a nice thing is normally about 15 minutes into the game is when the junglers really to play more around their team it's when for the baron spawns at 22 just drop they're not really fragile and easy to kill as we start going to try to knock things down that's also when you have the most incentive to gain experience because now these camps are worth more you're getting 50 more XP per clear it's a no reason Lisa Stansfield out of your budget and it's pulled some players towards well but I really want to get the crows cuz that's like 18 more XP than before and that's relevant to my interests and it's even this open some more players eyes even though the bus are till the average level 9 I seen more players in the early game being like Oh yeah efficient farming is and so that's why I really like the opening game from Cloud 9 mattress got we've got some more time here at the to talk where blabber he did play the Olaf aggressively and was able to also keep up hard farming these camps so that's why we always talk about passing and efficiently being able to plan out the your next you move all right where did the game forget that history lesson be efficient as a juggler throws time is money that's all you have to remember always be killing something or placing boards a Broken Blade bringing the Royal youth emote his old team FAQ in Turkey I love it if we made it over bringing this wagon to the LCS here has been a good top laner it is time on TV so far and then one that is is worth putting pressure on to it against white it's my business on TSM is a how often does TSM play around top mattresses around bottom side get speaking realistically to talk about opinions on vaping honestly can't do both well you can do both to a mediocre level or you can do one of those Lanes very very well and I want to see which one is going to be because both died within Broken Blade are worthy and you get a lot of jungle attention so that is a question for me it's my CSM this way does how that shakes out of course I'm Silas how well does coach jacket turn to look at around 7 and 11 and not a scoreline that a 4 time back-to-back two back-to-back Champion is supposed to get in the end result is a new head coach to do 80 karrie and tactical taking over the reins down there. Do you want Spotify have no problem talking is down we can even talk a little bit more about what generation on Cane because they've done so many little tweaks to it and it's a little bit hidden hidden Knowledge from a lot of players and so they've done a lot of little feel good things like you you think it's still sealed up this kind of extra or Generations if you haven't gone to hit a champion in a while so it ended up being a lot of players do this thing where you do the farm a bit then went to build up a little you want to go at least touch someone and usually you want to touch a male a champion because usually people are are looking for the red form and then kind of balance without go do what you need to do to keep up with your efficiency and and kind of balance that that's a little bit of an extra objective I like that immediately Yep they're battling back and forth little to go to the TSM side core JJ did go Relic Shield but end of the day the threat of Clips are kidding you mean see you know doesn't really get infinite Auto Tech the minions TSM gets the early push almost dies in the first few ways but with the red gun be sustained on a fillers is absolutely absurd the pope doesn't tend to matter that's done talking too much chords recently saved obviously has the men to put down some healing pads and a little too for the bot Lane on both sides but not much of an issue csmping would take that brush control as well I got a little harassment
