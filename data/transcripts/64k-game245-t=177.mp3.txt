plan on right now what are one on scoreboards gear as we look for what's going to be coming through this game store that dropped off a truck just the thing notes on a Tarik going to be coming through you me taking off the table as well remaining at that under for them presents the one time from biofrost that was enough for no one will ever want to see it again the pretty much any pro games as it was a very very attractive in that match with no waiting to see what else comes through ya ever allowed around but I will wait to see you when the last time I feel he's an aggressive course they're one of the teams that would have been probably willing to let out take place on themselves as they were trying to connect tickets backlash against TSM is optic throwing watch sport bands at biofrost discussions pretty instincts they do tend to think you can still play a lot of Harding age that men to Italy and Leona and Nautilus in these types of Champions we even I believe saw earlier today in LA CA poppy played against it at the W can actually block you eat from from jumping back and forth off of people you can get this done with that because it is a dash so it shouldn't lead pencil of shut down phones with play making that you meet has a row don't have that the rest of the grass has been focused on the flex pics on shutting down date is still up on the table so is rally at a likely going to be one of those band out but what do you propose I party junglers and it also could be an option where they don't go for either and then look different apps trade those kind of powerful definitely could be the case here so if it comes in optic ar210 those wins last week were against hundred thieves and Clutch Gaming through the other teams that were about a table and unfortunately for them still R CLG was the other people wanted optic that missed playoffs last time around so what I'm here to see though it is with play sell improvements how high can off the go can they take down to the LG can can they you know it like they have been able to do in a few just let themselves and then and then from there there there any playoff teams and then start sounding with what's think that's really exciting for optic because they didn't make Rodger changes coming into summer right for them it is about refining what they already had about being more together on the same page I think oftentimes they had a lot of tragedies that that made stet that's a dress made sense in trying the South Region always been execute on what that's what her strategy would require you know when they were going for school bus there when I was getting vision for this before so they weren't always Yankee for the football sure that it's kind of what I'm trying to track it. Can your guys's make sense but can you send a follow up on the steps which are required of that trash and so we'll see what comes through very high-profile pick up in Silas was grabbed it right off the top of this one ruined hate Sorel ES300 power people some exciting and toppling personally and xayah can allow for very easy work on Segway Tours end of the first half the draft going to grab cream of the crop pics for them as there's sheets if you want it if you want to take postal is very very early on it take the best known as I think it's in the game and I'm curious how much they think OKC or how much they Next Band face yeah yeah they're at their is away from these I really works as well as the General Lee is going to be a successful there a silver certainly can be a pretty decent answer into it if they do like to go that route we will see CLG though if they grab their work on here have the opportunity to be in on some of the good support answers things along the lines of no more, even after they are going to go out there, they are going to elect actually prioritize their jungle here that's far too it is weekly grabbing his Jarvan and he will be going up against me deals on 20% acetic we want me just only had two deaths across the two games and one of those was executing to a turret as they were winning the game so certainly performed incredibly well and we'll see how weekly who also had a very strong Week 1 new in particular in there when he was very dominant again under these I was really pushing amazing around the map so we'll see if he can come to replicate some of that stuff so hyper violin Gabe jungle pics grab seal Jeep Wrangler than they actually pair up the duo down there still the Jays fan comes in keep my CLG to get first dibs on a Asus Banfi wines down they both teams need a support and a stolen actually exist and sociology gets the better of that one and we'll see there's there's nothing they can remove and then we'll kind of figure out what they want to take some salesmen support and encounter pick the last solo but we'll see. I think that would make a lot of sense unless they have are going to really kind of at the Norfolk that is conditioned upon dress the trash it's really good but only if they don't have access and then you will see people save a support pick-a-little Leona Banh sinh Vera's is office team is kind of heroic encounter I've seen that be very effective a lot of time to visit may also a be hinting towards the fact that deal do you want to go with a different base support you know you you also see Leon has a very strong answer to things as a long line of his are they played last time if you want to play those for the folk style engaged is often very very tough to deal with the enchanters are gone right now they are the atrox on a truck balusters here but yeah with John is going to be Lux now picked up again we're still assuming Aftershock most likely but it is going to be of support down there I think that makes a lot of sense based on Leon event know this is another one of those pokestops at bored to death want to have rain she does want to cut a dictate the pace of that line I do think though if we could comfortable blanket that I can still be a good answer you can also look for other hard engage answer's no thrashing certainly isn't an option if they wanted to go for that route copy works very well Zappos Darvin and irelia so you could take this up for your Top Lane here give that to doka he played it last week as well as being able to block a lot of the dash is there you and that is worth so much really is power is actually driving back and forth through these men ways to deal with the use those recess in a fight can shut down a lot of what I really want to do definitely agree to means that we're pretty much guaranteed now that Crown is playing Silas here in the Middle Lane and plan around that pic now is thresh comes in for bit and if you're rude you can take a lantern but if you can do that and now it's time for Stihl G's final pick they could always move locksmith for crazy with that but that seems a bit less likely regardless though we'll see what they want to do around of the composition what's the weather going to be what I want to do if I can go there as well they take epoxy counter pick which Victor sorry I was Vladimir that's what it more looks like they're irelia versus file at the mid Vladimir beating up a tank in farming it in the top my dad very likely will be that sort of Jackie but we did say that last a week or when Crown actually did play Vladimir a guarantee but does look like it will be the result irelia also works fairly well on this island has an ultimate that is not very impactful if you do steal it great you throughout the Army don't have any reset you haven't accused actually use off of that gladimir should be able to kind of force out a lot of Mash Bros it's all different bilcliff and it's always think it's very important when you are talking about a tank if you are a different type of damage as a top laner than the rest of your teeth be all the force out spector's cow or an Adaptive Helm and Berkeley tried to leave early on dopa means that when he gets a G by Guess what does irelia G4 call physical damage in your going to be less prepared for that reality when you get to the campsite definitely important we'll see what comes through this game if they can make it happen to an 0 a good start to the split now facing off against counter logic gaming with their new changes a new top winner imported in replacing darshan who had been a long-standing member didn't get the pills back into playoff form a tough fight against TSM was the most recent loss over the beating off again be the thing for them American ready to go loading up on to the rift we are ready to go in this one versus TLC could be a really exciting one cuz this does feel like it feels he that's more set up for that bush is optic who's more looking for that team fight now this is the two or three can you cure for optic where they essentially have their main consistent damage dealer is only are right you know they do have for pseudo frontliners and then Arrow that's a lot of faith in this marks player be getting worked on in the team fights yes Crown can put for some purse but he is not going to be the one to actually be winning that fight on his own it becomes very heavily rely on that silver and it's cool to see them putting that faith in him once again into his credit I think Arrow has come a little bit back more toward form of this split and I bet you think back when he was on Phoenix one that was an MVP performance he had that title to his name but it hadn't been the same for me last year and a half or so this feels like he's kind of getting back of that for him he's been a good performance so far weaker opponents to be clear but still a possibility will not be enough you will walk away after my live there and wraps of Austin is more willing to commit to it they could have flashed over the Senate and guaranteed that kill but you are never certain that you're going to be able to get it and actually do end up getting both Kasa TP back to Lane since they waited so long to do it so that was honestly a great play here this is from Pee-wee's Vision you did actually spot someone up on that top side but assuming that the jungler not the bot later he had no vision of these guys but that's none was massive the boomerang blade does connect on both sides Crown getting that first password reset in the Sun and outbound the bottom side help to hook for two so far been doing a really good start as bioprocess junkies just 200 hp he's already because I don't have time to go back to base so spending the spells in midline and then having to walk straight down but he is already out of only was he in the mid lane fighting exeggcute or the brush in his jungle because he didn't know if they got them anyway cuz I'm cool down and that is a very difficult start now comes the part where you get little too when you start using the spell shield and a spider was play Dashie Super Deluxe a couple times and bought Lane doesn't mind game of your spell Shield versus for clarity and if she doesn't pop it you just burned spell shield 22nd clever nothing funny watching some people will play against ever you do sometimes see players doing exactly pencil sketch out to the side of them trying to get the in a throw of buying attention Officially missing out to the side and hoping that they will your reaction uses Bell shield and then it becomes a specific good enough to actually sit on that spell shield until they can guarantee that it's going to take him from and then use it that becomes a pretty high-level mind game and I will respond to follow that butt up on the top side Brewing is playing klepto he wants to Farm off of dhokla he wants to scale up and really put himself in a good position not to be dominant not only in the team fights but also in the sign language is really where he loves to play get down to make sure I can stay safe and wants to go right away on to her a CDL class without Farm doran's ring is such a curious dark here though for the 16th at all it's almost always going to be a dark steel or even if you want to have more potions that can go that route for you just go to the door and you'll allow him to have multiple potions at the start unlock the door and shield and it is still quite a bit a pea in the health and becomes more 80 which is pretty good and it's a five on hit damage in Vladimir's auto tag pretty crap so I get an extra 5 is helpful so it's very much my laning phase is better and if I shouldn't pop is an issue it is not the best aggressively hey I don't need the extra postage from the dark steel I don't need the reason for that you know I'm not going to be ready for a sadorian shield isn't the answer in these types of situations a lot of players will just try to go to the greedy by which is going to be something like a ruby Crystal and go between the CBR but again as you say that is left breast if you don't have the AP you don't have to be on his help your theatrics so we now watch as the middle and come through again temporary for me for Tarheel but as many waves bigger big trade comes in there but can't get return Auto Tech on the crown who's waiting and wave during good stun and a half a cup Crown goes down regardless and blows his own summer this is a no summoner build planner who just got a skill in a 1 b 2 for first oh my dearest music by the first it was blowing air out anything actually will stay alive quickly to kill the algae that is really big and you can see the power of evil what's like you want to go with him so he actually does grab the early recurve bow is very likely will mean he is going to be going hard core for this with the probe you replay it's a sin for the reset does go in getting a very low careful not overextend but there is The Flash just too little too late he goes down to spite flashing out harveyville able to walk away but oh my hotels in his Tepee still on cool down one level one so despite the solo kill their this actually may end up putting him behind look at how many minions he's losing down in experiencing that is the punishment for that level 1 play definitely coming up big here so going to get to watch it one more time. Trying to go in the Sun but Crown what's the menu at first because of that minion Advantage despite the Dodge on the side just doesn't matter power of evil didn't have a minion to get out and the ultimate slow is more than enough oh okay well good pick up there and we're back on the map with a $500 difference cuz you're knocking down some more.
