players we have seen make huge plays you think back to the last time that power of evil and ignorant worlds they took SKT to five games the quarterfinals and a very very narrow series are the ftt went on to win the championship in about 1 if I recall correctly and regardless and exciting match and top Esports starting out the world championship group stage course number to team out of the LCS back-to-back finals for fly Quest trophy in the summer split they also won the mid-season, it was pretty much an LPL dominating a fair and now I get to see who can make this one happen again is bands come through pretty quickly and this is a mediately here because there was a pretty big a difference between the players that I talk to you from group stage teams being surprised that the meta that evolved in play in being so much focus on scaling and on team fights and a lot more from this Grimm's from these groups 18I've been on Top Lane carries on snowballing and top-view sports are definitely positioned well to do that but with 369 but even so they been out the shed that do locaton blind for flyquest in playoffs he was willing to play tanks topside weak-side year for flyquest I was able to dry out that early van now Lilia first pick your for Saint torrent I know lylia got a lot of slaves in the play in stages but I think that was more towards the teams and players usage of the champion flyquest have been very good at designing level ones going after those early Raptor invades into red. Counter jungling so stand for in having that one is definitely a big opening here for flyquest plus they get the playoffs on syndra against night you're not allowed to give him the championsNight by a lot of the world is the reigning MVP on the winning team is going to pick ya Carly if it does go mid vs. the singer is going to be looking for that level 6 kill levels pics all in on this endris of p o e n Santa word better be ready for it by plane is going to be the focus obviously there's a huge advantage to being red side here and this is something that the lpo teams that utilize very effectively especially with 3 6 9 and the attention he gets from both night and car stuff so they're banning out some of the most prominent blind pick ones like Renekton meanwhile flyquest also they don't want some of the counter picks that 369 has used for super hard getting topside being taken away as well the Jacks no fuel or I can mail those types of things as well could come through I want to see if the orne band comes through here as well to get onein this draft is the first pick AP Jungle 2 on the graves and to be fair most is physical damage when rape is Mordecai's it only has 4th most played if the if you put some honestly physical damage but I'm curious if they can get him off of magic damage it allows you to stop armor in survival jungle top game unless you have to worry about true damage coming through as a welder some some crossovers there with the likes of yours so we'll see what they have to do what they have to Blind Pig for him because it is going to be right side First Choice here I would expect it to be I was actually expecting it to be support but looks like they are going to go to the Camila after so many Top Lane Champions have been whittled down to me is that this is going to be the first Camille game of the split 436 but it's going to come through hereis a great run Champion Camille seems to be in the meta as you're talking about Kobe Bryant's top tents to play weakside attempt to not get a ton of attention so that is going to be something that maybe buy a lipstick Leaf like with might have to change brush for ignore right now the hovers going to be a great pic those one of his very best Camp Comer con definitely the two best Champion for ignorance like last week we lie so much on his playmaking him and santorin are the ones who Curry action for the steam far is top loin counterpick here now there's not really any great counter matchups left up into the Camille because Camille has started to run grasp for the Top Lane ever since they had that Nerf on to conquer and it just makes her early and face so much easier to pull off even with the volibear with extreme Lane 3 hours to hear the ability to take extended trades with Camille Camille can actuallyyou will really good W suite behind a slow and you just go in for the grass Bach as long as you don't let volibear get multiple of W's off and makes it pretty difficult to really take advantage they're all right with the draft they're locked in and if no one else walks anymore set support is going to come through we'll have to wait and see if Jack is going to farm on the senate or just go for the metal sickle because keeping mine since to play competitive farming synagogue Nerf and how many Souls were gained we saw some split on Farming versus support center down there so wait to see what comes Thru by Jacquees of course no stranger this campaign has played in a fair bit and we'll see what comes through definitely utility from both bottom lanes and that's actually something that wild turtle has excelled on since the regular split there for the LCS when wild turtle was benched for awhile actually buy flyquest and match came in once while eternal return to the starting roster he just felt so heavily on a lot of these utility Focus 8Carrie gin obviously bring through the long range and snares that they can look for pics and flyquest especially as we prepared to head into summoner's Rift have prepared level 1 to Great Effectiveness in the LCS playoffs so I'm expecting it here especially since they do have Lily at 2nd and Niall ate some of those trash cans like Raptors and wolves look at the 7D games for you can jump in the support light II akali game for the mid laner nighthow far apart is going to be exciting game regardless flexibility of these flares was highlighted by the analyst desk and that just gives you so many options when trying to crack the team compositions going to be a whole lot of fun as you mentioned do the level 1 through flag quests in Turin is the first blood king of the LC there's about worldwide 50% first blood is one of those three Canyon over on down One gaming is stuck in those my believe the threat isn't that worth this year he is absolutely a great really game player to get the gold leaf and that is I think the one player that can stand up here I really do have hocus and Thorin to be the difference-maker if there is to be a flag football upset the odds of course are against them this would be I would say the biggest upset of the year is like was working sex I am already on the table for youwith what people expect as the best team in the world on the right hand side their top Esports had the last two trophies and summoner's Rift the summoner's cup is on the line here we go for the first time in a group stages in world twenty20 flyquest number to team out of the ALCS and top Esports the number one team out of the LPL and the tournament favourites are doing battle here on the rift and we heard from Solon wildturtle they said getting out of groups would be successful R Us that would be a great world performance getting into the top pay for Tuffy's what you saw that tease the LPL want their third-straight world and we see some defensive wording on the bottom side here with the little pixel brush at from talk Esports and the hubber there for the possible Lily Adelaide invade they went through with the early sweet make sure there were no Wards and place the word of their own that Wards ensures that they'll see if top Place one later into it and will be known for the start here for Saint torrent as we said Lily can I lease is Raptor can't because of the are we in the burn in the kit also being able to kite very easily this is a move from carsonville trying to answer that is over the wild me to leave try and get the buffer but don't believe he was just going to be level 301 it's lilias shows up with white fur blue send foreign did not burn his point he was going on right there and Carson you talked a little more or less can happen with Lilia that's why people are so surprised that you know some of the results from play in how much you coordinate your level 145 to milk already is not enough damage to kill it on the top side there's no more potion left here on wild turtle as well in the sustained Advantage will be on the side of talk Esports if they are allowed to continue in this bottom side match up because there's plenty of regeneration insects get through the passive plus I'm with Jackie love having his own biscuit as a well they will sustain the life Advantage with the Minion plush is going to be the difference-maker there as well turn on agnostic and try and get that one in the 200 spell the recall ignore is patching that when they're going to be sticking around going to need some jungler intervention down here on bottom side 3/4 there are some of the smell is Alessia Cara is the only one here his flash is ready he wants to make a play there with that threat so we'll see after bottom size has been cleared looks like to go to crab should be in the hands of horses while he finished his dad up he could make it pass through mid so we're off early colon. Cleanse Right Now cards are going to just make his presence known in the Middle Lane for Kent's down topping and putting back before then comes back in here comes a bit of damage was caused first applied for himself weather Camille this is going to be very very devastating for the match up on topside teleports are still ready so so I won't miss out on any of the minion experience and get right back to it but the early gold will find the Camellia here trying to get to that tree Force as quickly as possible if he goes with the toll for an extra investment they trying to get some extra dividends out of that first Blood investing it for the future there's nothing to look at it at the shield there for solo 2 is going quite good guys extra W off but 369 is able to continue through them despite even with solo flashing the stun yeah better training better Fighting by 369 despite the scale shopping dog bite making this more for the shield and damaged it was still the better stats on the Camille side so well then a369 300 sports so far lands and most places fairly equal to CSF set volume limit because they're still awake to pick up for wild turtle and Aiden are but he's got car stuff blinking in Right Here solo flash list might very well be in dangerous guns to town for a while but Carson knows he's not spotted nose pin to be safe and solo just getting whittled down the moment a free TVs in this is danger sake of the team is already there and this is something you can see from scouting the LVL cursive very often spends his time talk triangle of the map visiting Knights Lane visiting 369 slain and with the summer spell blown up on the top side plus the first blood taken very nicely done for him it didn't actually take very much time at all sleeps into the brush their for Elaine game for himself to capitalize on it and this is going to be a devastating Camille he's not rushing straight for the Trinity Force he goes for weight control because he wants to affect the rest of the map isn't it attack you can make on milk when you get such an early lead like this a an early Tiamat you can violate this minion wave and look to make plays later Camille because of the Rings with your hook shot can set up plays for the rest of your team still effective you going to play as walking the mid lane but Power he was already on the recall for lost chapter pretty decent first Spike was there same goes across per night though on boots and a revolver is going to feel pretty solid text watch a prosperous I want to listen to be shot up there zero in 6 and 1/2 minutes to patients for 369 pays off you wasted that line Bush long enough I sent orange clearing out the ward and they finally strike taken down Bambi returning to the topside without losing too many minion all this is about the way I think I love you expected this game to go top Esports I'll say it again and you're being a big moves out of the top and jungle right now Carson able to lock down and get it pretty easy pick up here in these mountains rate bot Lane Farm Lee has been going to Jackie love so far even just like those retail timing chains about an 8 to 10 PS difference over wild turtle going to have been on fire are the number one team from the LPL
