thank you very much and we are into Champion Select and hopefully sooner doesn't get banned if we can talk about this sick mechanics at Riu has and Jack does not do things guys are watching the segment though will they have learned it I think it is very unlikely they would learn anything from jet segment there these very rare is gold feel like extremely good syndrome players that are now to do what she was talking about bands or G rex versus hundred thieves okay well anyway last game of the tournament for these two t Exodus fighting for the pride of their regions fighting for certainly the pride of their own teams both want to show that they are a team that certainly you can pick out please other top teams looking for their birthday when is looking to stay dominant over the elements whatnow you know the time test results Galax. Could mean that today I guess that's why she picked in the bottom light bathroom in one thing that I think has been missing from this hundred save Squad is the ability to get afro volume to one of these unique and they tell me why I bought or blitzcrank even a fraction I think this part of that is to do with her Sara hasn't been the most stable midlantic all them however I do have high hopes for this game it'll be interesting to see if we got see the BART earlier today certainly didn't work out against fanatic but he did play is thrush last time against you have a very good game on it I do also believe that after I moved you is a very strong play making support he can take over a game on his best day and he's going to be looking to do that here for me when I forgot another word for something when you play forgot earlier on so I can see better look for him I was sad to see him on Scion both their games today in the group stage butthis is the look of a composition that I say put two of their three best players on big Champions and characters with the agency over the stitches play one of the standout play as for why we hired another group stages getting in the middle of the game 80 carry that does have its own playmaking ability as well in the callistus Italy says his direct line up up with except that we have a lot of potential there as well with a Twist that you can get on top of your Spears up I'm certainly are some powerful killings you could run this could be a support brackets for koala is a flex available there though obviously to Jungle for emptyyou should see where how do thieves goes with the 80 karrie cuz there's already been a couple Marksman band that they did decide to go for the chili at 4 and up before the second round of being so few more of these Marksman and try to get themselves a preferential matchup for Stitch see if he can be the difference-maker in this game and One Direction looking really good and play into a particular phenomenal player hopefully he put another good show for us today and they're going to move back to the picked up but we'll see what he wants to go for I assume they'll wait to counterfeit mid length of a car is fixed can be locked in here historically Alyssa has always struggled with her at the Landing site take out the trash can just walk it actually take this is a fairly positive line for a hundred days and nightsand you know for a tiara bands out of him to second tier of marksman fixes all really good you got the photos caixa and xayah who were almost every single game that where you looking at losing art restorer the serous think they're all very good before I do think is a strong leader to be these bands talk more about mobility and immobility reposition in a fight you look at the bat is the reasoning gear and that is initially what I had assumed when you see those Ben varis is going to have a hard time getting away with that being said you do also have fresh with afros in a good position can land you out of danger in somebody's buy gallium Nocturne gragas everyone flying in on top of you and it could be Calista office that is flying in on top of that fair at them they're certainly going to be going aftercaulifla Mobility carried like the Thalia like Tavares who I think could be very vulnerable in this game I agree to a certain extent but I think that that is a great game plan if you generate a lady to push forward right now you don't have to push in the midline you don't have to put in the bottom line in my opinion either if they go into a 1-3-1 set up show you can pause but you can only have so many mistakes before 130 just ripped it open to look at going to come down to whether T-Rex trying to take those windows and so far in the group stage they only have like two degree definitely would agree but at least it does get for them a very clear way to play the game of very clear wind conditions at something about a talking about the ability to pick these dive contest to give yourself a clear way to win every one targeting this one or two players everyone going for with the same goal it is much easier to execute very often than it is to play a front to back or to play 1-3-1 or somebody more complicated Place dolls and here we go into this one is we loadfor the last game of World for these two teams if other things when they picture themselves third place in the group losing to the LPL number 2 in the EU LCS number 1 and Thing 2 in for a fitting couple victories over here acts themselves made it through pretty they were mostly dumbest throughout their game hoping they can at least get a single Depot in which team could not just yesterday here in the group State and so doing one of these time for third place in the group to definitely some pride on the line and we can see what he's going to do for us in their last game of the yearthe players are as well and we'll get ourselves into our fifth game of the day laugh out of her first reports coming in after this one tear up the blue hundred thieves in their home colors of red Sunday on a bit more of an influencer in the stop playing in Milwaukee is Rios going to try to prove himself on Rise and I do want to mention the fact that they wrecked coming in on planes he's going to be able to make it out of that group and kind of what this means for the album estrogen is a holiday really would like to win this game and tie it up at 1 and 5 just because you know when you say mad coming in people did have some expectations on the room and keep my soul has flash if needed a body slam from quality really need that I can take some out of this world crowd control left leg injuries and depending on how hard and a goes they can maybe force delayed recalls but theoretically they can get back to Lane and not miss too much here that's the reason why the fountain still really nice level one and they may actually startthe red will see if they're going to stick around at all they have a lot of words dropped on the side of the map but could be another delayed invade it's really good bit of work to do if they want or spotted yeah that would be a pretty sure they didn't notice that was actually dropped because that word was dropped in their Vision so I think they should back off and go to their own blue but we will see could be it could be a level 1 rhombus is pretty crazy start they know that no one's even exist yet now they can see it and as we're both getting weed stuff koala have a feeling I wouldn't body from the right if I were him a lot of words all around make sure that they might be coming down he will not be the body slam he'll stay alive that's probably to be before 3 call Lynn to be hard with that little healthy yam and he's going to have to go back to he's going to try to lasso back in this is already a bloody game and I have to run a car on top of damage charts overall come out on top I would say with the steel way of the red and it's going to be a bit of a tougher start there but empty is already counter Dudley he's already taking away and is red so not even sure if that ends up being true an app remove going to have to use both his potions at does get very hello but they do. Down on the flash left can Sunday come down his own. Y pique and if he's still on the run in front of him with me to go to having a fairly good side to this damn nice invade I think over-aggressive from afro nearly cost them but then pause while back to the top side of his jungle football stopping at blubaugh and able to shut that in Baytown very far ahead yet level 3 he stole away the bus and he's coming over here behind Danny and he knew that and I was right there he knew that he had just killed his jugular that he would be on that side of the map candy plane without the respect he doesn't have a cleanse he has no way to get away from this but here is empty no word in the brush he's not sitting in clear that camp from the brush so you see if end is coming over and should have been able to position perhaps a little bit better to keep himself safe model is in fog of war and then you can't get the jump on them you're throwing pebbles into the Raptors itself helping and clear out the gas station she's actually has up by from and I love the fact that it keeps licking back towards the middle part of the maid maximum distance between candy and the tar that she's very well play also positioned himself to block that Jeff is so not enough difference was really ever going to be able to be created there a really good start 400 series but you have to feel a little bit has been kind of donated over to them here by G Rex in these early minutes I'll look it up in a pan here it's only $300 difference bookkeeping my other line's been going pretty well you got good farm from emptying of Italy for cyst on the bottom side so rude to be had a nice way for butt Stitch does have plans if needed and a seismic Tuffy's and has already for you know very nicely done from a hundred thieves jungle dream game here four and three killed in 4 minutes is a very impressive star for him and he's looking for Maurice get behind candy here he does have flash he's going to stay out of range of this real rise so that won't be a killer summary of the first failed Bank of the entire game for Android and I like how active hundred days of pain on the map you know we said we would like to pay it again soon pictures they went to some place I didn't really work out this time around pretty much every play the F-14 has work to Allen White look this up the story called yet will actually let him go back enough it is one of those games now where if you are dear X you need the game to slow down a lot to come on lunch yeah you definitely do and 1/2 remove nice with a flash play the classes available but not much chance of getting out of that one without his flash up he did have a clan but not able to create the distance then you see end up Lincoln right in to get that pull back when you get it when you get hooked self still could have even though the hook and it afterwards and now we go again too far away will that make us play a Frozen fog take a lot of damage I got to try because not going to land good. Buy fish and if I'm not going to let either koala stays Alive stuff from Stitch I need the sidestep you will stay alive and now it's going to be a 3-man play or potentially to me and play your album the topside directions to keep somebody from getting back to his turret so up to the not as well fit PK so if he's able to land the Miguel the flats key over there's no way out for some in a sisterly going to stop playing going down and a lot of farm lost with already tipila stop when I need to play around PK on it was very good something I would have liked it to go back to us more stop playing carries and that's a good Kill Ya certainly and I mean it's just the self is less impressive to me than the setup that he'd already put some day or twice before seeing the TV back she'll come out again free 6 then he has to make the long walk back and there is there waiting for himself or the execution may have been easy but certainly some impressive Landing from PK to make it happen and I think the more impressive thing is they confirm the kill instantly that the flash people flipped back guarantee ultimate we've seen so many ultimate come across a kind of hoping it hits they know that they have to play set up why not go for the hundred percent way to complete it nice more and more Farm 21cf lead up in that top 20 game might just be the force that directs needs to get a win of the board here in the main stage world are they will sadly and forth or time for we'll see which way the ends up there and I'm going to keep clearing the jungle for now though and equal in far but me Hunter gold brother kills he's gotten the most be funded Through the Jungle happy and you know it makes me laugh game the ignition off and a half way through that second flip the media is the next at the end of the year is tithing required to this laptop suddenly changed the way the hundredths place had to approach the game on the flip side you remember that they were playing a digital midliner additional support player sometimes two additional jungle is at the same time for T-Rexes a team that was trying to find that magic recipe computer other mid-layer play but let a couple times candy came in once in awhile now Stitch going to be looking to do set the game he's got to be wishing he was level six so badly right now if he had the ultimate perhaps going to turn something around there but instead it is that's two kills four hundred thieves and everyone get the way but app remove 100 days of just lifting much more coordinated
