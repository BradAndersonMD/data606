Gardens play Avery T fighting opposition they can you really heavily off of Jarvan jungle that was in team fights but ultimately power of evil just took over the game on the Block I went and looked at the year-long top board meeting worldwide LeBlanc 11 damage permit across over a hundred games do the half times the professional average absolutely massive RJ performancethat was when they were on blue side now it's like what that guaranteed counter Pick 4 Midday and if they want to hold their LeBlanc or did they made fixed till later in the week off the table flyquest do not want to deal with that once used to be a band here as well as respect and it's around afraid of Bengay to get to work on an exterior that focused on this bottom Lane using their early draft picks to get a strong bottom lamp for the fence though really like lyrics right now really strong Lane conditions quite well with a DSebring on top of it all right and I got to wait on the support pick up right now we don't really expect to see some like there is stearic but flyquest do really really like the atrox enforce Polo he was pretty lame down in the previous game with pressure and honestly been pretty good team fighting over all that didn't find a pillow kills didn't really see a lot of Roman up to that side of the map but end of the day we're going to see if there is a chance to sneak in the jungle or a middling counterfeit as gold golden blue Bureau in week. I to get them neutered in the play on defying All Odds. Blue has some spring split I do agree with you perfectly think you to try and get that in round one that you have effective I'm looking for these bubbles over the wall to find pics in the mid game going to be quite well with the dolly forward on top of it we're going to work at Vera South Kent let's grab the Blitzkrieg let's York the time can bin22 valores a teammate the safety's a two-for-one deal will kill them both if you really want to go swag you can collect the full the blitz right at the hooks and get double distance stop Windows if he starts with an angler and Pantheon that's a juggler and a half are they just installed doing so much you can make a fist power shots after trying to get a lot of extra pressure when you got a blitzcrank light off. Halfway there just so many options here for standard form to shine through and do that is one of the top junglers and he's been putting in the work Pantheon we have to fight fights are both incredibly powerful throughout the season and we send her closer number to All Pro junglers this split in North America do Footlocker on tank Duty as well. Malachi comes in afterwards chatterpix freak a red cypress like West in this game they wait to see the Zoe and then used as a red spot over and over on you fly with a showing power of evil very confident in our people doing almost half of his team's damage point something percent it's just ridiculous scale up a little bit later in the game doesn't go offensive quite as early as LeBlanc who can do this time in the apply Quest Super Carry power of evil initially about power of evil it was about wildturtle ignore more or less what it what you want you heads up giving them the control to go for the early Drake it was solo honest when the 101 top link with the priority pick on the atrox and then yappy we basically farmed equal Diggins goldenglue hit me. In the mid game and PeeWee took over the game if one who does not find a way to punish the cast in this closer cannot find a way to punish Power Bill Cassidy it's going to be hard-pressed to find a way about this before he's seen today that pee wee can take a mobile the semi assassin or maybe just pure assassin and just take her to the game with with mobility in Target selection alrighty so all the summoner's rift shortly we're going to go as we wait for a buffer to build up for competitive Integrity since again in real time there was a remake on the game but I'm definitely excited to see if you can come out ahead on to this one I think now KY is definitely underrated tank clear the pro teams have it 80 or below the organ that was what Hunter played in the first game is what flag was abandoned in this one but ultimately Malachi should be I think a very strong pics I think he has a very very reliable engage he's really really Tanki you don't get it yet but I think he's very strong I think it will look good overall in this game I want to see if I could be some impression that I really want to see if close I can get it at midlane can land a couple of games because kassadin before level 6 does not have good mobility and is a gank magnet and I want to see those Gates actually land completely agree before the Cassidy gets level six and has access to the extra Dash from walk leasing is very good at attacking the champion has pretty good attack damage early on in the cast of them's got very low armor so if so we can land above 11 or try and help set up something then they can attack the kassadin but the power of evil plays it intelligently and also stand for in on Pantheon covers mid then that can get very dicey cuz you overextend Pantheon is very good at turning those around yeah I definitely Washington jungle match up a lot we had the first name start with a well-timed invade by Golden Guardians down the bottom side of the map they for Center on off his red they forced him to go to Craig's end of the day the two jugglers is traded camps back and forth and neither got a great gang soften till they be 13 minutes or so and when we had that first Blood topside back kind of started the ball rolling for few we were they kill off Han sir but honestly it was it was that about to fight for his work clothes are found good knock UPS be found good oldies to it's a lot of people in bent over and found good Smite these turn around these different they're incredibly incredibly early-game focus a comely pressure Focus the one caveat being the same toward August Pantheon should look really really good in the mid game looking for side leg pressure if someone tries to match power of evil in a side lane Pantheon comes flying over the top kill every time I all right let's get onto the wrist and they are ready and this is going to be an action-packed early game as well everybody eyeballs on the blitzcrank I want to see if there's a level one from flyquest some sort of delayed invade I do see a sweeper on ignore that is a key component when you do have plans to go for these early invades because very often teams when they see an opponent blitzcrank will leave a lot of defensive Wards early on and they will expect those moves big. They tried to bury us and turn the corner and show themselves but yeah yeah Giants as they just barely walk right back out as bi completes his recall comes back to the map and it looks to go towards that bottom side no Advance on portable spot any jungle exits if clothes are goes with say Red Bluff to invade it's going to be spotted ultimately we don't have it really a bad by flyquest a little bit pensive. Golden Gardens might do and don't choose to risk it is going to end up getting leashed up at the top it's going to be hot after giving him that easy one up there so look into a similar thing least percent or it will say a charge to do more damage early on so it'll be a faster first Ampersand children did it will be supposedly sick all right top side starts for both of them then we kind of do expect early actually done bottom so we might as well talk about that lane like Swiss Francs into tahm kench pretty obvious reasons that it's pretty easy to hook into tahm kench even if they do go over really bad. Pain DPS over the top to take that first trade with Guardian But Here Comes the first seal for movement speed and it's all in who he is well that's going to be your friend to just 5hp but what a great start flyquest ornament First Blood yeah. Like his dad Progressive quite so much anymore because jungle different pantheons sand pouring we had a highlight on him looking for early place you go straight from topside Red Bluff all the way fly down to the bottom side where we are looking for some bottom Lane accident and flyquest do not disappoint that got a Calista with Franklin and a Pantheon jungle this spell early aggression since 4 and wait for who he and FBI to feel more comfortable after the tongue lash is used Stick it to splash ride in they go straight for various they know that there's no possible Valor any other spells because it's a level 1 somm can't use this Sunday the tongue lashed so they get the second flash out on top of it and this is setting up a lead here for wild turtle in eggs are with the Calista blitzcrank know some of the spells for anybody on the bottom half of the map so that means junglers will be around at least you're not going to land the key we of course have midlane pressure for gold and blue so it shouldn't be expected as level of play but passable lose the lathe really got it means that the birth control to get Scuttle control that's at least a little on the board for Golden guardians but this is going to be a rough one to come through Pua is honestly farming nearly equal you can see 2024 in CS that's completely fine for Castleton Augustine First Blood bot Lane looks great in very early looking like we're poised at another flight facilities and this time around they're the ones with the bottom line control in with the Calista so you would think plan for flight Quest should be kind of similar to last game where you can use dragon's head towards one of the early dragon souls the only caveat is that you were just going over different when I sit and really does need more time to scale goldenglue here on the Zoe should be able to help out with keeping a lot of vision in this area of the map and its Rich really only the early kill and the possibility of blitzcrank Calista play making that kind of sex that up I'll see if I can keep happening as they are just watching each other Drive the paint than clear the waves of the topside again and it I mean realistically right at the bank no one should be dying here the next level or two probably could Lane well at all your sing solo start to relieve pressure in it's got a man at all in with still don't have that constraint he's doing you know better and better as time goes on and we're going to close or she try for a play I'm not sure what's going to work one Trickshot and afore solo pops really like that set up from hanser that's that's an experience Malachi play right there
