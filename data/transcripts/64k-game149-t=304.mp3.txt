little thing that I would it take from last weekend in Josh's one watched about the bottom line because I have also been very positive on everybody was really wondering if you can let us be on stage but they did have a really deep in Richfield Play where is teleport with relay out of that seemed to me or him whatever whatever but the teeth wait not quite Instinct Last Time Around in delivering to toss their first loss off the band's here. Lance with kids and will first pick that set-back baby that is incredibly strong whoever he did lose over in game 1 of the base maybe it's not as good right now or who knows the rock up is available and a very good top laner of course her spell the philios on the board for Johnson drafted by The Misfortune right away is a side of the tableis a lot of forward pressure FL this is one of these Slater in League of Legends you can all in this guy talking about, to execute to if you want to try at home Oak Hill Lane with your buddy Misfortune and Leona is the way to go because you hit Level 6 going to kill someone promise been picked up by ding Tai to try and stop that Ron's idea obviously but if you're on breakable when the ultimate come through try and block that I went in my experience you just still kill the Rob maybe throw the combo down there still will be very volatile and especially if a jongleur his present that is what he has them are going for me. Last week DSM looking more aggressive they were much quicker with their games I think they're average game-time literally dropped 20 minutes from Week 1 to week 2 andwe thought, doing offensive volts forward with diarrhea flashing forwards do you know the team is looking to create their own advantages rather than sit back now so I'm really excited for this match up to 3 how well dignitas that actually played up Turtle this point for plaid pick they don't want it to counter a frog and style Champion smoothie my thinking he wants a big obviously things are going to be more susceptible to go to Stockton stop playing counterpick and if they wanted Midland kind of a cute as well I just talked about. Octo for a second he is 300 and 3 a year long in the first 15 minutes he's actually doing a ton of work for dicen in the early game what he talks about MSBL to being a good bottom and the Gang for Canon versus set is I was going to be a whole lothard but we'll see what made in bottle look like and I expect. Off to get the better be really good match up here this is a very moody style top way match up kicking the can in there waves at jungle I mean theoretically yet he was speaking it into CEST it can be rotated to Jungle as well so deftly juglife a lock of the kale I don't know but yeah but I mean I think it really is going there like a really good wine and set isn't up with your Ford Artic so that's his 52 champion and 5 pics they got the flex to put the final match of the Brooklyn wants to play and broken Place had a really good week to be put in a lot of damage of a lot of work and you can start top Link in a bowl for match up with you really can absolutely take over the scannerespecially if your gate work at 10 to what are we go super long-range Great Wave clear you back to W quickly beaded top window as far as I know and I talked to a lot of Frozen versus all the time trying to get tips and tricks but they have all been in my opinion I had more fun with it because she might give you more Mobility than you're used to on top like that so any extra Mobility does feel really nice however in the jungle position it is much more difficult to fund a build of Trinity Forest sparex style and they're just dance is Way Out Of Reach the super hard like big hairy crazy unkillablestyle built are much more are in the jungle unless you are super popping off very very frequently do you get these full tank suspender hog full Defense battles I took those are actually really effective if you can get stone plate because witness little bit of snowflake you can really soak it up and you still get out a Baker's you still feel want to lay in the middle for two damaged stuff I think it's going to be a little bit different to look from set then we stopped from broken plates which was amazing for CSM and got them there went last week that will see if I can return the favor all right through the game we go as TSM indignity battle she gots what's 3 + 1 * 12 mm back to the LCS and frog and gets his battle with Purex in this time around he's got a real team see what I can do for himself as a gun with a wreck right where's the dick chance I forgot couple who like to have parted lips Duke's more constructive I think he makes us feedback little bit more constructive than before when I first run TSM he was there's a little bit too much red you know little bit too much of like emotion now it's a lot more constructive so I would say that's part of his growth that's one way to put it is always red energy by the way always Flav anyone in the vicinity even if he doesn't have any malice towards them about it off just because he thinks it's funny shut up Kobe stats it's really nice to hear that you know people everybody that goes in and out of DSM que Fue Tu Auto Lee Broken Blade pop it off in the early Lenny face still got a proportion Charges going there use it for the extra burn on his trade won't have that much sustained left for himself though so I could see the damage oh yeah couple of grounds there for some people Farm while he was pushing up to so not only did you miss one as well but also so you got a good trade in their the earlier stages of Elf eyes are a little bit more finicky until you can get your super clean it's the double w cat decides that good stuff. No Broken Blade out of church Branson take one tears are for the auto I maybe take that one nice play the Broken Blade yeah I definitely take it he's also fixing it up here on Hootie let's see if he how he deals with jungle difference though because oftentimes you look at a matchup in isolation and think I owe what was a good trade or bad trade is this even of winning match up well that he knows that he's drunk with his bottom side of the map could have been there but we'll see if they win this almost too slow if you ever goes left and right now that has to be a flash you can react to that with your reflexes we found isotemp right there I almost want to go back there looking at Midland because that was the difference between our first game and this game you're still hovers down to the bottom side of the map where they have a Ward safety side on the bottom side so he doesn't put himself out there for the elite what I could prove you're talking about there's a trait of low at the bottom side and yeah that's what you get with Brom the biofrost we just far more help and I remove does they do push the wave Endo so now they got time to Rome they can go get a schedule because Leona has a stud in her kid I should feels really nice if you can take that as a bottom lane Maplewood Dr. Crossing mid though he wants to claim the jugular Bounty that's gold is rightfully his but right now it's pulling back to color for app cash money in the pockets there you go meatball drag just taking the high gold Camp of crud take the recall 5 campden but you've got more farm and more dunnottar like right now have you looked at the bottom side but I think it's life is so unlike with healthbars is full of say are they cutkosky at alright challenging spy for him as well so he's not even going for the stroma sure saver doesn't want doesn't even need the extra Mobility we will have to check if he has Nimitz logo cuz he has sorcery he's letting them is Cloak and he's running water walking who's running the movement speed portion of the story secondary tree so that both the Red Flight will still give him some speed right nipple got changed this season the movie on summer spell Houston ultimate use so just like it's running it's not nearly as effective as skirmishers Naperville with the I found it so why even take go down with it but we've got a lot of course they're going to have the extra defense as well goes a long way for jungle set cuz of course you are going to be lower in Gold so they need more combat effectiveness of the topside fight may go back and forth 143 cowesett Broken Blade to grab the United Farm closed and locked back to Lane fragen have to walk away is bjork's in teepees in let the first reset through that documentary temperature for AC Pro Controller the area busbar 40 at them because they get a recall out of frog in this Dragon play may look bold but that's all because Rock and reef out there so they know there's no possibility of Midland coming in it is because of the difference in the Summoner spells here so he doesn't want to get pictures done combo your dad uses to teleport and get some a dragon like weed on there it would pick up there right has the upgrade its might use the W-2 form a lot of damage heal back up as well and that's a nice way to pick up there and put it on the board for TSN goldstate little bit dignitas favorite nice trade right there could suck don't you come down I'm pretty good for a lot of spots actual gold is bust a little bit cuz you can talk to you think again trying to find this gate for Greg formerly on Dirksen steam just be months ago now against them hope you can find some pick up there not going to cross the midline spotted now they know he's bottom side is afro recalls away I'm still sitting at connecting to pretty close early game broken play topside checking back in with the earlimart Reds versus Canon I actually do like it a lot of people playing a lot for tenacity but can in studs are the real thing you have to worry about flexing your getting your double Effectiveness out of your magic resistance because it's Annelise jungle so it's the perfect by a hard crowd control NFL you still going out there it's like you've definitely Always by Merck Forest if you do not exactly the correct Choice there to see it on the set as well and probably Leona although movies once again waiting around for next day display a text about a fairlead awful early game and the attempts of gangs were there they sat in the side brush but no real fight been happening about us going to learn from the first try that you can't really eat and then brown spotting early so are their training Farm back and forth switching inflamed very best food for themselves and we're approaching the 8-minute mark are so the pushing team which is, a vile Frosty reports he has them should be able to get there are retail swap off if they want looking at top side right now who needs does that the ultimate ready for himself but hopefully I can bring the watch that fight as well and early because he's got the cooldown reduction year of roopa in preparation for this fight if they force the back from fogging again it will be another neutral objective okay well pushing in right now is hell's going to be going down at 8 minutes 20 mins game and this is definitely TSI math teaching you control the topside they fly the middle and ending up there as well and now it's working late Samantha decide to put away Harold picked up bring him back around but no good fight and look at that shreds means you don't get chain CiCi's out of your tenants done all the plastic all the ultimate coming in play today's top hits first what with the flash has taken there actually goes to deep under the tower lock them up in the end and that stun is enough to get to kill under the dower turning the kill back around on them take another look at him chasing him down. And even I would say even this far
