they are closing games better all the good stuff is going on TL very much improved in the second half and their loss is really in the summer split be coming from the first game to fly quest in the second part of the proof round-robin it was a Ford Credit they were getting a bunch of nut gear was across the ninth with kind of one of eight game best record ever in this playoff format. 15 and 3 inch healer poised to make them for themselves so this is a macro picture one of the best flips ever in recent memory is Team Liquid right hereI hope so Tim McGraw. I agree I mean they had to happen to him very very well they've been so incredibly dominant especially against the lower to your team's none of those games have looked even remotely close their losses have been only to some of the top four teams in EG obviously not as good in the second half of the first I was there looking like one of those really good team but it seems like a mortal see if it's been just destroying them so I am expecting TL to be able to continue along those lies to be able to grab a win here to cure first place until then I'll continue that Improvement I think you know the questions for TL are no longer about the regular season this how we stand up in a best-of-five they have drafted know very much towards play Candice rafted very very standard they never really mix it up whatsoever so people are wondering who can that be exploited come playoff time because they are a team that doesn't really have a lot of Champions play slow and no maybe a TSM or a C9 are there someone to throw a curveball and try to take advantage of that. Did the number one or two thicken Pro play right now Boulevard I think tide for that kind of spot and very very strong here as well and was interesting is with the karma band would it harder to find a good Lane match up with into Caitlin skateboard very very strong upon aquaflame several times before and it's so hard to beat overall and with a fresh you're not looking to win through late I mean if you can get them released play where your fork visit making am I hooking right and left I'm going to hit both of you and you guys want to blackfield yeah you kill whoever you didn't block Shield right but that's tough to try to make happen in any part of your under your trip so I really heavily favored Immortals do a late but hey it's out of land as bad as a monster is going to get other things to happen that's one of the things that you can always remember is that sometimes the best way to challenge the unbeatable to be to South Lanes is actually forced the opponent support to Rome with you right so if you can actually get movies get out of Lane as that thresh Force the Morgana to try to answer because you're putting on so much pressure towards the midline for the jungler is that can be a way they can break up that to be true that you are expected to lose try to make things happen obviously the act as a lot of utility to help those kind of fights also you could spot out the jungle you can spot out these movement around the map with the hot shot and try to find Windows of attack an Indica at Lisa's right these plays can convert Leigh hoppen Team Liquid have found ways to do so they actually have gotten better and better in the early game they've got other things I'm incredibly strong to go to put the wrong on red sign I'm kind of expecting them to save last pick for him to make sure he can get a good counter pick you were seeing the Shop blind overall game I think these are probably the best bands you can get from Mortals looking at this graph State I think that's the best I could possibly do Olaf game farm Heavy Champion where you you kind of put more the eggs in his basket to carry he's really much more supportive overall to take kind of broad Strokes here for top-line it's not even though it's been Panic not even one of the most that she has been ban against them even in the top-six so I think they never do go to it so if it's Mitzi can perform that is mean big things here for we had seen a number of really dominant carry style games from Olaf's troupe is split I do think that Mortals have pretty powerful they gave the cured here with the Caitlin a 12v is here they're lacking engaged though and they're kind of lacking some of the support of style tools for the Olaf to give him the war of the lasting power in the game if he's going to be strong early game no matter what but if you don't have any sort of support for if you don't have the dive buddies for him a lot is going to be for worthless late so I think they need to draft the Top Lane Scion is going to be DFA but honestly is not like reliable hard engage like you that you can kind of salt in there but it's pretty easy to do step in front of that is one of the members buried that from coming through ya I guess you can like tank in front of it yeah the orokin W into it as well you're right if you still go off if you're going to like this why you off and just bring her out now I got to walk the number one spot in a chance to borrow against the at them as well kill to do that but they are now a window behind play a position filled in dignitas or at 5 or tomorrow to play a tiebreaker or hey if it was Ghost with some luck they just get to spot at 6 wins for The Mortals are fighting for their playoff lies they've got to win at least one of the next you will see if they can do that at some point Pacific side and graph you've got a counter pick a collie from Jensen is going to be hype and it is going to be very very exciting and you are right it is 1016 where those boss came through for a call either win rate went up a couple percent a very significant thing that we saw collie and Lucien both this weekend in a solution ekali right before their Bluffs when we haven't actually seen them coming out before this is this is a big step away from what TL has been doing though they're consistent image of this cough is pretty bad when you're looking actually over at it it's basically just the ash you have essentially three tanks if we kind of put rush into that sort of in a bucket and then you have an assassin and and scissor of dairy a typical composition here from TL it's it's not as though they are just guaranteed to win the fight if they sit back yeah I think that they could easily lose if they are not proactive so they're going to show us a bit of a different look like he is playing Just magically Champion azir LeBlanc TF do it like that is all he plays he is back to assassins here and I don't see how it goes and I want to give credit insanity is a very very good player I think he is a he and tactical or my easy front running for rookie of the year I think they've both been very good so far in 2020 Immortals going for a late invade here on the Olaf to try to find themselves in early chunk they are going to I believe fully shipped the night here I don't believe anyone saw each other on the way in but it's easy blue Bastille as rocks it is doing I like this look at Rox is doing his like no leash Red Bluff topside we get an early aggressive-looking and from Impact say okay it's not a Blue Bell start from the old but with this passing it with hot oil coming from the top side of the river through. Brush it means if they know of anybody who yep do they know that is actually a pretty risky move there from from Mortal things you missed the finding so that's what that was enough movie First Blood coming through Apollo took a long fight with stomach hurt even if they were fine if they had something else they were fine so I can ignite but they didn't have all the combat Summoners and now the re-engage portege will not be rude tattoo can walk back the lane and all my gosh PL got handed first one of the bot Lane the full hundred to do all in after the Mystic binding I mean they do if you do cuz it cuz that was pretty bizarre I understand that it's a fairly strong what's a binding misses you just need to walk the long way around instead they walk in the flight lands here from core the day they get that early heal and then just feel like we got a little bit dated perhaps know by this by now because the night still comes through that he had already but use early for the he gets laid in again and then goes for the que hierba flash is still available to tackle the night splash I was that was not even like the best case for some reason but court is it was still full helping the other two were still going to die right it's not as though you were about to win that fight so pretty surprising at the very least though so far so they did push it back to base the first one went score JJ so it doesn't really matter that much and we'll see if the Immortals 2 V2 can recover from here and try to take it as they would have more expecting a plane from the end of the day there is still so dirty. Use a plate 40 take me to the bottom side shock comes down from lorman time comes for with the matchup what you see or NW to start charging you let it go for a auto see what's going to work out so Lauren really liking this matchup but right now his back is winning in farm what are you taking some decent early plays I was he forced himself is either Ruby Crystal doran's ring from earlier on yes if I could have been informed by a lot lately careful round dinks in the top side cuz broxah is already here use the word but if he if he's just a little bit more far forward I think it's easy as can be probably dead I could not live this I don't want to find a stud he's going to flash back with you got to be kidding me they actually meant to find a way to be W I can't believe they got this one Rock The Flash the sun couldn't get it in time that was a great turn around there are able to flash out by time he arrives Insanity with the quick TP and they do end up getting the kill their over onto their Olaf and 1/4 impact back to base his TV is going to have to be used it was some Farm midlane but well worth it there as a protector top cleaner and get a kill alarm when it was very far up in this is not top hits you think he's probably dead you are assuming that the Olaf will not be here in time to save him but in he goes there you goes off at the same time knocking a processor Insanity arrives there's no TP on rocks are there and they have overcommitted USA got that kill zombies enough to help turn that one around so after the TV is coming through the best case for sale was the one for one but it ends up being a 1/4 yeah I just want to see if rocks with flash sideways a little bit like it's warded you know where the key was coming from just just don't these guns are 300 damage that's lights a little bit better at least I think that is mechanical Miss Play My Darling by Cady Stanton dlpc level differences would go for the all-in but doesn't care what they kill will have the family will enforce is Saturday to recall and he does not have to eat this will be a lot of his way of getting canceled as that is a freezer for the turf attentive as a freeze he get the flat also so really nicely done their way Jensen you know that was the other part of what has been the actually lost and I mentioned the farm but he seems nice. now that's the way these roads on in the spare Lee problematic because that just leads to an extent instead Jensen just want to save it to be so he's just going to go back to Basics by after that push he will deny more farm so just trying to make the most out of that TV to top link from Insanity telmate a the TV Advantage he'll be up for him up experience then I able to get back to base and grab another loss or overall game state right now 100 gold lead the Team Liquid oxy first blood is some of that but there was one could have backed by a mortal overall Farm advantage of the top side of his the Middle Lane and different spot that's probably fairly close overall in the game is really close overall level 6 on Bill top leaders here TV up for a lure him down for in fact Flash the other way around 4th and Pac Tulsa what place in the queue in this could be damaged matchup for Warren is you can see when you're forced actually see s s ion is in this case will see if I can catch him back. But when you don't have access to walk up and finish them off with your melee so it does result in you bleeding farm when you are into Lisa 76 matches SI impact sling it well and punishing as much as you can today trying to maintain a pretty strong for him vanish just look at Barclays. At NCS difference here for Apollo NACA will get a lot of that was the fact that special how to instantly recall off the first wait after getting that is fitted with only assist me to build a bear with bottling pressure and middling pressure just need to walk it over to help me get that plywood Rick picked up before 8 minutes so far so good to look at to be really comfortable with us early game is going and honestly not a farm in a disadvantage of Bartlett. Took a pretty good as well exactly I mean when you have a stress into the cave Morgana and in your playing you into an Olaf and you're the one getting the dragons you're going to be pretty damn happy about that that being said Mortals does have a lot of scaling so it's not the standard TL style of game where they can kind of just depend on their late game and say all right to sit back and take the incremental advantages you do want to see them
