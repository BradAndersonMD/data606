Creations that you can only really do by playing the game by being in these matches and we are already now into champ select is giving absolute Banger Cloud9 and TSM this weekend classic they had the academy they want both of those so TSM looking to take him down here again what would be the most important match 90 n round robin tomorrow yes the early drafted than Siri Siri rap OK I am actually wondering is this Wukong bought is this actual events or or Vulcan playing at you know as as the farming Wukong that is a strategy that I've actually been seeing uphas popped up a little bit in Pro I do believe but I've seen it until a few quite a lot as kind of distracting Center we're going to have a senegence playing the two types of force out rule for adding picking you do have the roof on his power farming and in grabbing all of that gold and you know really it can be pretty powerful strategy of course this could just be Wukong top could even be Wukong jungle article that out scoped out of the flexibility is there a horse's year will be near Blaine we know now it's going to be Misty's azir vs. your sins LeBlanc you would think given their kind of typical roles said it would almost be reversed as known much more for getting out of Lane for invading with his jungler for really kind of playing this up-tempo style and is generally is not that unless your plan is just a AFK push in the lane and allow you're going to go today that way and it was actually pulling off that when we saw a clip of him in the heightthis one but going to get gate number two on either of those roles has like incredibly high band presents you know it is still the most banned by far in the world right now and it's almost always band on right side so it's back to Cloud 9 left it up here not only did they play a game did not get pant they didn't first pic is a very clearly wanted to get this over to DSM I see if that was actually the last time I remember there is getting through picks Advanced but they were the ones giving it over 30 Mason going for a blitzkrieg Calista and trying to punish you in that way so I'm really curious to see what cloud 9 strategy is going to be to try to punish this Veracan blue be paired with the bars that does mean to be a really strong lady who owe a having the double ranged characters down there can be very punishing if you want to send Wukong down to that bottom Lane as the farmer can be pretty difficult as a melee Champion into double range to be able to pick up a lot of farm without just getting for rats completely out of the lane well we'll see what comes through here at set is locked in and I can't be certain which one's going where but yeah I mean set to go junggle top or bot Lane was what is going to be set at the heart of the pork and pot line BBQ number down there with sent over there I will say that Center did get box to Lasting scent like play Katy Carrie sent it to get stronger if you packed because we see the occasional player play it I feel like the forecast for Hugo spectral sickle but we'll do the rest of Champions are at is going to be one of those Champions guzzling because Orin is I want to pay the top later for my prediction is born being flexed around and that'll probably just be depended upon this matchup I do think that mordekaiser you know obviously is a pretty good match up into both but particularly difficult for torn so that could Ornstein bought the farm but with the current raids what was this way we won't speculate but it's really very very strong are the Santa has a good amount of her ass is trying to create face for this week on the farm you're all in is actually quite strong there to you know if you can land the center of roof and into the knock up there from the Wukong you all had potential is pretty powerful obviously the Senate able to give support and added damage with the ultimate for the week on allowing him to dive more deeply with the ultimate Shields there also and it is a little more of that kind of team fight style of composition here from Cloud 9 which I guess is is less difficult from them and they have been more picking like roaming and skirmishing and winning lanes and all this sort of stuff so I'm going to be really curious to see how this goes because I do see ways that TSM can actually win this I think that they have an advantageous Lane toppling I think they have an advantageous play mid lane actually give them Pantry winning Lanes here whether or not they can execute on that is a different story but I mean you have your verus barred against the Wukong is trying to farm that's actually really really difficult in the early stages LeBlanc Unit has the ability to it suitably out a z or potentially in the early game you know he can be a organ 50 50 matchup if the if there's your kind of just out push do bong soon as you can to gate that a bit more guys are definitely favorite so this is interesting and we already know that kind of club band plays their bottling weak side of of the players in this game the bottom two and goal difference at 10 or Vulcan and then Sven beneath that they are they are very typically behind at 10 minutes the other three on cloud nine go ahead obviously TSM very strong a lot of latency the real Cloud 9 flip is between 10 and 15 is when they get all the money when you start giving up and playing Team fight that's a really big really big games ranked for C9 but I agree the early Lance are going to be very interesting we know licorice tend to be super down up the top sites put second place in gold Sprint at 10 and not top link is broken plate on the other side has the two best performing top laners an early lead David they're going head-to-head and imagined as you say is going to be Broken Blade favorite your liking all these lines here and we know it is an outstanding player through as well as a speaker is I think the second jungler and goal difference of of players have played more than like four games there is a lot of good stuff here on the TSM side I expect the early games look for the explosive I think the team fights to be really interesting because as ear as to do so much the heavy lifting in the overall team flight status Wukong not the same persistent damage that you're going to get out of a verus for example so very intrigued as to get where these team comps move around as time goes on as a group up as to get the TM Fly and see what the players loaded up and ready to hit the rip is finally time to jump in to Cloud 9 versus TSM hello and welcome to summoner's Rift been giving the thumbs-up because we have to match of the week here Cloud9 and TSM a battle between the most dominant team announced his history and the winningest team in LCS history TSM got all those Stars the Jersey Brothers trophies they hoisted the number two team in the LCS right now would have only two teams to beat Cloud Nine all year hoping to bring it back again it's going to be a really exciting game in a such different styles of compositions coming out for the team because he actually on both sides so move around the map to match aggression you know if there are any games for me and you have to be very wary of those types of plays and minor thing but this is actually yorkson getting a deep Ward there you can just start the distortion on the Block you start over the dragon ball drop that work is very safe. Actually looked at those types of plays because you can just double you right back over that wall it is worth noting I did look up some of the Wukong Bots that so it is actually 5 and 2 and pro play across the major reason so has been fairly successful obviously fairly small sample size know of just those seven games but is already doing quite well yeah of course we got to see Matt Lyons work out twice as well dropping said it would come into various Lanes so other teams have gone for this exact sort of setup for you do any of the match up there is 10 to be very frail or the game has a lot of range but doesn't tend to matter when you can close the gap on Wukong he's so hoping to infuse baby low durability got a grasp on set up really really nice as well of course you're cute by Plies on hit you can like whacking they did once wait 3 seconds then Q through and you poke them Plus at graspop so your your book is very good there it is for example if he's going to go for that I've been seeing which is just grass Senate and it's it's full-on like tank like frozen Mallet Rush with grass and you're just playing to be incredibly annoying to essentially instead of having a glacial augment you replace that with the Frozen Mallet you apply the clothes with that you're constantly stacking up grass for the bonus no permits Health that you are getting and and yet to talk about the terrorist versus the Wukong you know various Bard your job down enough that they can't look for an online because the all-in is very fragile especially Post 6 as you said he's very frail doesn't have in a tremendous amount of Mobility out of the all-in with Santa and Wukong can look very very good but if it were calling is poked out too heavily before it gets the opportunity will guess what you can't help and that's kind of what these two lanes are going to be looking to do it you're very a typical bot Lane you can expect the Wukong send it to be behind that they should be losing as far as Farm know that is very much so expected but I can't look for kids later I have Elderberry to the mid lane Mesquite high can a little bit too far left hand slide I don't know if they thought that they didn't I don't think it looks like they might not have another pick it up to go towards the Scuttle so suddenly First Advantage comes then puts a storm down blocks away and easy swiping through a play buy speak and grab that one takes a camp out there lies the total Florida cross tattoo done with your supposed to get to trade with electrocute he wants it back and get that for himself and that is what that looks like because you're not able to really reply to that a very very well done their metal trades infancy what kind of a bill he will go here we've been seeing more diverting bills from the Azure some people are going last chapter and then just sitting on that pretty much forever you know going to Nashua to some people are then even just skipping the Lost chapter all together saying I don't need that man I can actually just go doran's ring in a dark seal and then go straight towards my nasher's and death cap in the interest in these types of Morty pipe powerful items so very smart word if he has no problem there going to be a vulcan's going to knock down the next to take the following for 18 goalie camp but that will let the camp despawn and level have to go to the gym later on still is next be taking my speaker well done to him check out the top link temporarily is partly to licorice Broken Blade is going to whack him once real quick not sure if he got the the craft off in time and overall the far pretty good for liquor stuff like that you're not really looking to to fight the mordekaiser too much unless you can kind of Pokemon down if he makes too many mistakes were just about withstanding the onslaught getting as much pain as possible getting to your forged items where you start to really become very very useful ever clean those device and noticed that the Vulcan is actually the one playing the Santa know I wouldn't have been surprised it was actually the opposite a lot of people when you do other family center actually put your your standard parking player on that because they are so comfortable saying any of this Marksman Sol Champion generally speaking then would probably spend with the playlist I'm playing melee Champions and bulking and now it would be engaged just the wrong timing on that motor set up differently regardless though still for the double thumbs up a Vulcan 5% so him and misky obviously went at it pretty heavily but why is he wasn't sure if he was going to be able to avoid that sun or not to go commit The Flash in nicely done there they'll get the pee pee out of spend it is going to be a Sheen early on to very aggressive option he clearly is looking for that first you're not feeling afraid of this matchup and no will be going for or the most burst out of his Triforce instead of going for something like the stage or even write speed to try to play it a little bit more speed run good poker cannot get away from doublelift hail of arrows either so already spent at 1/2 HP and he couldn't have afforded to buy the full fee you know $200 no difference you could still go lots of Ruby Crystal and be like yeah you know I want the stats now so don't I know you know it's it's very clear what they want to do what would you see that it's like I want to kill you right that is a reason you by The Who by the genes the same things and only when you see no really isn't and stuff go for a defective items they are looking more for you all in less about just being able to get through this list is up quite a bit a farm and they actually kind of had held the wave in a pretty nicely it real quick out now to work and because he's keeping much later he's going to have the better by I will have more gold there so you know a lot of longswords sumle Fallon
