Kobe and officio thank you very much Dash and RSD in the analyst we are in the Champions to collect already and two games before Cloud 9 food Raven bands out against Nikki Heaton Vitality had an incredibly that they taking down Genji from North America reminder to get to make you picking it up again before I'm laying here by removing Adderley typically when it comes to Laney want to fight for their bands are taking David trying to remove some of that play making one through one potential to my channel to use successfully with their previous game the early irelia Banda forth with Echo last time but very soon in this traffic as well go with specially with is Raven band already off the board they're very much focused on the bottom Lane and you know I tell and Jack Frost might have good matchup for the boys definitely that's not a secret anymore cuz I'm a little surprised by Cloud Nine I think they were very successful in town if they can with lysandra in the play in stage and sang Hey you don't take the girl we can get priority elsewhere but they chose to go for a very stand-up in here and they left that Sia go to the Vitality that we saw from seen on yesterday against the highest pacifically destroys others that was definitely a problem for peaky yesterday is the matchup we talked to Z and R & D absolutely destroy Cloud 9 a lot through the bottom Lane they're opting in to do a similar set up this time around ready for round two if learned after day 1 to 50 I do I just want to see for telling your so I can if not but tell if you will take it and it really fits that place. They can do on record here if they want to and have like insane amount of a gape would really suit that play style and that's the thing you always like to have a 1 to engage with Ricardo 101 just have explosive and gave but if we need some sort of Frontline with me as well work on very frequently do very quick with the flash body slams ultimate so often. Definitely open 14 vitality and I wonder why they scared wilstein I have a calendar page for the wreck on seeing if they didn't take it themselves like it did yesterday I told me to get the confirmation in 20 more than I like it he likes to refresh a lot I always feel like it's very mixed results on it personally I've only played a back handspring as well I would have taken the rakan but maybe they're scared of a kind of thing and we have seen some good rest place so far at World this year but we have also seen as demonstrated by Jack on the analyst desk how very easy reaction time to thrash and interested more hanky-panky an overall so if you get into the head be head heads up and they both go in and out longer and you can feed Nautilus to a world so far could be a very good sport here and I was wondering Wednesday night with crab tank for themselves licorice more of a carry Top flavor but still has Play-Doh sword games with Jen games with Uno games poppy 31st I need a front line when they've gotten themselves that made in the jungle for Spencer and expecting a squishy for Jensen as well but will be out here just come through a different driver what are the slowest champions in the entire game and it's not a good primary engage because of that back so they're going to look for something else because they already have really good follow-up you know to Leah can put the map with the wall again about a creative uses you sit there and try to can follow but they might need something else as far as the initiation goes I think going on and then lock picking for you okay would be pretty smart if you've seen on a different things save me last week from it is very good against a guy on the Echo and I can definitely say that he can bring the pics as well he plays a lot of different styles of Champions by SIA band don't smoke it like an orange coming in and then you have pretty good and Gates on c95 getting banned Away by the time I get to spend coming through here the orang as you're mentioning of course a big one as well and has that albeit long-range engaged and Stucky liquid has most played of the split by man play the top winner from them here and waiting for their Midland counter pick out a dent then by the go what do they want well liquor is really has been such a big star for cloud nine this year ever since joining The Rocker learning rookie of the split that split-second in top wave boats there honestly even on text Papi play his or inflate have both been very strong so it's really going to be about how can the team actually bring it all together because getting their state of the counter picks for Fort Bend my pillow block been thrown down the gauntlet is there and tell playing so couple shop is one of the players he Prides himself on being able to play like everything I need to do to lose to the professional scene way before puneet did it I need like to try and go for counterpick but I I never feel like a super successful for Vitality when they play heaven to watch the top by like you always preferred on a tank I think Jonathan is that you find Middle Ground here you do have a pic while you can just play around it for you also can bring some value for 445 Anson engage tool so I think their job in is acceptable but the order on the side of t954 Metallica I'll Gallie I might be coming alongside rest a divers-down maybe it's hard diving Keepers benign a lot of engaged to play around Spencer and sneak is the primary damage that is the biggest difference between yesterday surrounding sneaky with tons of bodyguard lots of bowel control Supply plasma through the enemy team allow him options to escape into fights or dive in and move forward I think that the competition they can easily play defensively or off at the meanwhile Vitality with the LeBlanc in the mid lane that should always have priority over galio and it's going to be about which one is mid day in the jungle looks like it was the Jarvan that will say jungle in the top in here for, try to post one of his most played actually is ready at 4 stop playing in Kik is going to the Red Bluff in two level two gang some of that he has done versus North American teams in the past on different team or with the bus to Jarvan lowering the cool down on Marshall Cadence the passive a percentage damage Auto it's clear that actually significantly quicker as well we definitely have a conversation from Vitality way they can. A lot of place even in the early game all the lanes can actually apply pressure have CC setup for Jungle to play a round it's not as easy with your long-range engage that yesterday but that's a lot of playmaking alright let's see what happens if that's what it's going to be exciting one year up North America is always a treat to watch it Worlds by tality off to a great start they took down the defending world champion in their debut about 9:40 p.m. if I chipped have not nearly as good of a results as Uzi and Cole walked all over them yesterday but now it's time for maybe some veggies that a C9 hear this group does feel a bit wide open if I tell if they can make it out and we'll see if they can battle Vitality while here with the Predator Jarvan very excited to see if possible positioning here around early Wards goes as well as it looks like they're moving up into the fresh not going to be threatening to much as far as the invade how was your day Spanish lamp over and snuck his way in behind this could be bad for sneak if he shows himself all right now is Asos tracking jactroll they know where that price is going to know which way he's walking up for this side of the map so sneakers going to walk backwards and not much risk there is no one was too greedy on their movements and C9 was kind of profit season. If there is no one else 29 waiting and if we just ended up walking away they did leave a war behind on the Cloud 9 blue buff as well so Vitality will retain some information off of that invade they sending tickets over to the Red Bluff to start that one out by himself and I'll just continue through the Jungle Red to Leah Spence Karen starting on topside in my route through and it's already tells us a bit about the bottom line Focus they didn't stay to give a super good leash to kick his ass if you wanted to join seen on Insta me when the wave arrive so you can't get that first push for level 2 and when you're drafting is thresh pick instead of something I can work on you're definitely saying we want more focus on Delaney face everyone I should look for some pics around Jetro he is the kind of support release a lot of himself and he wants to be a huge playmaker but it's actually the most inconsistent support we have because he will be 1000 time it's also weird thinking that the option of not taking Arora Khan with his Daya is the option for more play making considered the extra range in the explosive engage that you can get with that champion but it doesn't feel like Northwest you know he has more options can Lantern Inn and maybe a cyst kick it up a little bit more in coming to that lane so maybe I want to have more participants in the bottom land party and I want to see what those parties going to look like it was going to get down there with you have somewhere to teleport in for Jensen in the middle and of course galio himself good at showing up once I was it comes around and watch a game face up against you say on this LeBlanc you can be very very scary has the ignite really good place to Progressive alongside that driving jungle how does early Lane face is going to go because so often and we've even seen Jensen himself in the reverse of this match of Alma LeBlanc absolutely punish players for early picking the galley up getting a lane Advantage pushing them in being able to roam first and accrue ACS benefit for the team what is the zuka going to be able to pull off here against Jensen I don't think too much because of Aftershock on the Galileo and TP like it's the super defensive set up on the gallery of hair should be very hard for us to get to actually get the kill as long as chance I can practice Aftershock obviously and that's kind of a thing if you look at the calendar pick here and if you look at the inside, it's really not about chance of being the big cares about licorice being the big Carrie Underwood on either you mentioned listen draft already it's all about sneaky like you want to make sure sneaky becomes to Pitcairn the late game I think early to bridge to what it is going to be the Thalia pick and what I like to see is often like to Leah with things like Alice. In this case it's an old was if you land on your roster what you are going to get pulled too and you can then land and knock back from it so then you can throw someone down really quickly yeah that was definitely more risky than as not to be for the hours for in Glick you may be a Gal Gadot aunt catches on someone and you can get the Yeezy size mix of but I definitely agree with you to Leah plus crowd control setup does spell a lot of early game first damage and some possibilities here for Spence Karen I know he's the one that has been starting since we got the group stages for cloud nine now back on the world stage and they're going with them or veteran of their jungler off yet for the course he played the last half of the best-of-five even qualify as a gamete took c92 all five games gabba play the first two was okay and then spend came in a kind of took care of business right the way through went to him on that score line and I certainly seen again putting a lot of at that face back in their old line of a kind of interesting how similar their lineup now at this point it looks to Spring split where they had all these roster shuffles back and forth 9. players Reddit for C9 throughout the split and now they're back to the same 4 + basil that they played throughout the rest of the spring I just kind of find it interesting they found of congealed back to that same roster and now you're back at work or motivated motivated that was the thing I mean we actually just have to give so much price thereto C9 Organization for The Scouting work they did and how did you like this huge trust because there are some of these names here that you didn't expect to see in the lineup if you go back a year like licorice office in the top Lane if it has been a great addition down in support of these are players that they didn't have to go out and like blow out the budget to guess cuz they actually got them from their own Academy team in to the main roster and that's exactly what that system is intended for me and while on the other side kick it was such a huge pick up for Vitality as well you guys can't stop telling me about how they were at 11 and one since picking up the new Jungle ER is absolutely a great story even Vitality new life and it has shown up here in world I mean they come out game number huge upset takedown Genji Go up 1-0 in the group and and really this was even still with a lot of the rumors around screams coming through not so hot for Vitality yet they show up cute performances and they get the victory would they screwed up massively if they did that surprises on if they get a chance she but we kind of looked at that matches what state does one game where they're going to beat these guys get day one is the first time they faced each other they can surprise the results I can already tell you that I don't think I've ever heard anyone say they were strong spring team it's always like that a lot of fighting a lot of kills and then no one knows what's going to happen and that's kind of been to style a band playing in practice on stage and I like that I hate team to play Super aggressive and screams and then play Super passive on state I respect if I tell to take for the same style even if they will fight and they played a very very good mid and late game up against Genji X they now they're in the
