abilities to carry so don't give up too much ground elsewhere yeah I will note for a cloud 9 sake that they're bought Lane seems to be slightly winning with a pretty non-interactive Lane overall now the office there is FBI new heroic bid for a tail and that's going to happen timestack away for that but the actual two-on-two went pretty well on cloud nine speed for the Deeds of course have suicide scene I'm at the laws have shows blueside here for the rest of the way they're going to see if he is going to not be on a global Champion will have to rely only on summer teleport for that and I feel a long time coming looking at overall stats for the player 3tf akali so he's going to be on something else this time around clearly had been very keen to play the globals in Canton now I am suspicious of a cloud nine cop with bladder on easier I feel like operates really well when when you have either rangeMobility onion on the on the Cari Champion to be able to make some you know how plays aggressive plays lunar doesn't do a lot of outplay he does a lot of Brute Force Pro Car Guy hears already gave the number to hear they're going to they're going to change your going to have a charge for Stiles now a hundred thieves do they have a lot of options cuz there's a lot easier to control with quit hiding than any of the other Champions at blabbering normally place is the XP at 10 different leader of this entire amount of all 10 players he does really heavily out for his opposition was a champion that is good when does leveling up his abilities getting rank 5 in Phoenix and then level 16 rank 6 in Phoenix that's going to feel bare feet and exciting and I'm a big fan of seraphine with walk at you melee championship belts you'll be off of them she gives haste of Champions likeyou only need it for like this is the making of a good composition I'm not sure if it's been I think she's good in both those rolls through fire like a like a Renekton or something along those lines some days Renekton you look for an even match up in here at best I expect a hundred thieves to send that use last round of their first phase Pixar on Renekton maybe leave a car instead take away those two main possible you know Champions here for flights to even feel comfortable on and then work with the famed Renekton nidalee use this so so many times you stood him up with W Spears land and if he dies honestly if if the grass is not banteer I think that would bepretty big oversight four hundred thieves meanwhile Cloud9 trying to ban the way supports on the other side you do for possible leans into seraphine I do expect them to go you don't either Misfortune or Ash. It's a similar strategy to The Misfortune where misfortunes is better in my opinion at it because make it rain at tens kids and you can just cast it as the cert seraphine shoots out a projectiles but land the first slow so then seraphine get to snare for follow-ups as long as you land the vale so we'll see 449 if they want it kind of combo with that Wombo the other main focus your C9 is trying to get some priority in their Lane Port Moody or to work with so they can actually a powerful and so he can actually get you know to the the turbo cam chain so we can get more speed for the canteen in cages and the Bandit way who he set you see how to see you throwing some bands over at Fudge get rid of those safer waveclear kinds of Champions and you mentioned the possibilityso you could do like the najib an oven take support us and then I've gotten three Top Lane removals but the Alex Remains the hover looks like to be the lock-in don't fail us with right you can see out of the serafino so you can get people away and then kind of resuscitate your team for that so it does I think fit a composition Obviously good setup for Kaiser as well you have to crap when she goes all into the canoe very scary people ain't as well and navigate to see what the last picture club Manor going to be we have to be top and you know what are the two bottles of Vulcans Alistar as well playing this okay team fight this guarantees you already mentioned you know sarafine very good with Brute Force compositions Tarik is also very good if you have something I can guarantee they engage I think they need something now to guarantee like like you know a hectic ultimatum something to to lock your opponent's down to force them to fight with an aultimate decoy scooter with the turbo kente can run very quickly but there is disengage the old and then here looking like yes you cancel engraved but I would put more money on the new deal for topside he definitely can trade decently vs. Renekton we have not seen this matchup in a very very very long time but but we can't go Phoenix for for Wave Control while he's trading with a Renekton the difference and since we haven't seen in a long time is can he actually take the stand toe-to-toe trays with Renekton try and use your turtle stance healing back up off the wave remember Renekton can break Shields with a fully charged W looking for down there so be careful with your turtle standall right top right now and he's got a key Advantage I guess we don't have to worry about the stat check that for her. You can try and pull that one out but Grace obviously going to try and use the rage Advantage here nice little twist from from cloud at the end where are they going to you know not back down on game 2 already of a best-of-five in their pick and ban phase they don't they do it with the twist they give up their range Advantage Care of vs. Renekton let's see it. Fudge cuz there is definitely a lot riding on this your top priority is very important if you're facing Renekton Italy to try and break that definitely takes a lot I just wonder if it's even really killable like a scooter cease be enough to kill Renekton when like minions block virtually all of Grey's is damaged like I'm not sure you get anything going topside Electrictell me when the killed because you have a bunch of birth they locked out I don't see the easy way for you know this this top site for cloud nine am done over there beside feels like some set up to the minions play around bitter Bots and you're only ever counted income for the top side we'll see if it comes through. It is a best-of-five first of the Season between Cloud9 and hundred feed the winner of game three four five hundred take is going to go into the lock in finals on Sunday waiting for EG Ortiz fight back, did not work without fudge brings in the top Greys for Selective pressure with such a lack of enthusiasm my heart just dropped and then I probably got a gay could you counter gagie is so important because you can turn this around so effectively and remember Top Lane being a long way in keeping your vision control of your side brush is way more difficult the most difficult for any of any of the laners there so there are a lot of opportunities for a champion like you do it does have to rely on just move speed to to take opportunities of controlling the brush on the top side of the map slipping in for Lincoln's for brush King also big big big Focus router is always PVE as everyone is well accustomed to now that it is actually become a premier pick and an Elsa gay and LPL except one of the most spectacular actually for this last week for both of those leagues trying to power Farm try to focus on the dragon control try to focus on your Rift Herald you don't have to score a kill to be able to have a successful top-ranking Caswell by the way you can just work with your grades either counter ganking or showing so he shoves the wave with full priority verses are in acts in a very easy for a grave to do to control that wave with a range of an ad with the alien Vantage and transition it into Rift Herald you earn money very very effectively like that just taking that top Psych show cuz you don't have to call a bottom side rotation over for it nice little damage there and Ice q auto could chuck and who he and you can't keep the farm going on the bottom side did go for a point there stands at 3 I do believe I might have missed that one regardless of course shopping around the topside Billy will be top sites to have to be careful this way is going to bounce I believe it was known that closes on blubaugh so but we'll have to be careful because it's capable very very soon and if it will take red you could already be yanking I would be very very surprised and flattered went for a point in bearskins because you can power clear your entire or jungle and get to level four fours go to craft demon Spa what does Champion Energy level for to get the Bears dance rank to Phoenix really really really improves your clear level four. Even sponsor robot game even ordered it first blood for old are baby let's go players season 1 championship with the speed of the clear again for your attack speed by the way the gay cop who he uses the speed you'll get out of the. Philip range of the queue get right back in. Ensuring this kill blabber is not going down without a fight free 204 the Udyr already and when a champion like this get the lead in the jungle now you lose all PVE control yes Natalie does not have to fight that you know you can always run but if you're always running giving up camps giving up territory giving up Vision on a map then that where the the objectives start to roll in for cloud nine to two very important early kills here for flapper remember he does not have a flash so using your bear stance speed to be able to dodge Spears and stuff is going to be important oh my God. so freak sometimes people also would ask me why why do play who Do so much. It's very easy to fall off your mechanics are the champion it was also previously thought that you can't miss Spears I'm starting now you can't honestly yeah maybe you thought he was out of it or just just simply misplaced it but that is going to cost them you don't have to spend their resources topside attempt to dive as well teleport from Perks comes in to defend this time and this is all going the other way number 100 thieves very clear game plan coming in good shape select to go for the engages and they pulled them off all game long this time around though Cloud 9 waste no time and striking back and there's lots of land surrounded play top felt I felt something has twice as much but I did just based on how things were going to let you know what they look at 3 for fudge sundaes back every time you don't have to kill fudge I will kill your bored it said but can we get any minion XP not really yet know I think I got a three-way light so far this might be number for they do get into the experience range birth with the rotation over does alleviate the pressure and even with another attempt your 400 these continue to try on that that top Focus that nidalee Renekton trying to build on their draft it is keeping put down and see us and he is here with the early visit towards the grave but as you say unsuccessful in scoring to kill true self lever going to feel pretty comfortable pushing on to Art 7 now it has been an equal can't count for both junglers Bowser has Farm equally to bladder and they just haven't threatened to kill so they've been as active just once been more successful and you can see the 600 gold lead to Cloud 9 is the result from that one gray is from behind though he's barely a champion damaged steel caps all ready for when they match up again down the line and you know doesn't have much you to speak of you can temporarily blind the rise that's not too bad but not that you will have the combo deck painting his life to make sure it happens now can you
