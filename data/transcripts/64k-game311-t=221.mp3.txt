don't be able to watch them almost more importantly Genji did not look good yesterday they got absolutely steamrolled by vitality and the echo play Ivor right already again and kind of sit up here around the bottom Wayne ruler and Luke are both so important to their teams in our city KY set it off the table not late game Cari Champion with y'all know the best in the world and that's what he played yesterday otherwise stash baazar, to fix rule has been using a water used to ask yesterday although he was my first little one for him but I need to see if it's as I approached becoming an inspection with airbag on a truck already fan of your sidebecause you can trade pics back and forth is orangey saying we don't want to wait to Kerry from Top the Forgotten a truck they're gone and then she get rid of two of those heavily has a purpose for bottling with the Kaiser alexco be to someone and I really like this angle from R&D in their band face you'll be late is notorious for his playoffs and World buff and Galant buff and he definitely is a top laner who can see what are the champions to the hard carry potential Farrah dusseau the Diana we did expect this is very common for 6:05 the kind of presenting opportunity for the opponent to split up the lovers Duo breakup get the record for themselves and force them into a squishier but very quick are all in engage campea the right away the Scion get the grass here we know that is a flex between top and mid lane go wait to see where that goes down who certainly a huge Champion school for him and ask flute monster on RNG when it's not it's him carrying when it is going to be at 4 to take the backin science would fit the bill for The Weepies on top and jungle I want to forget it support of Midland of a crown to play with the Camille and greatest Superstore to me to scrimmage rhymes with shuttle from winning slot length too hard when I have to wait until the second face and I also wanted in the Attic air Precision Tire and interesting right now because the G2 game is so fresh and everyone's memory where do they use the Camille still effectively with Wonder Swift would think but I really do like Harley Camille jungle how quickly he can go for a lot of control early getting those gains off I really think Lulu camil is a combination you can do crowns syndrome was not great yesterday in The Gauntlet he was successful running a lot ofChino Hills Eat24 Patty made an exact to style you looking for with him or we going to have to wait and see what exercise to walk into the mirror and muscle built in Santa Fe items have a surprise though neither easy nor able there other 80 Carrey has played it all throughout the summer break in desire because felt you like illegal to block one blade color feathers but it does seem a little weird to me immediately. I don't think it was the root part I'm pretty sure it doesn't I could be wrong I don't know that well but it doesn't seem to me that they know they want to do that will work well here I trust about my matchupsI like it really a fan here especially cuz you expecting to fly become Atlanta and then the guy who can lock the kids and we've already seen a Rollie and now be super super scary houses available available in Ultimate rides ultimate available for themselves and Constance chu chu train right down the middle from Zion they can Sports engagement Force flashes and then use their follow speeds to chase people down where is Genji they do have explosive gel Chase opportunity for with the Olaf locked in that is deadly to be a stowaway and Camille has really dominate that the top side of the map love Lulu against rise and listen around the Midland Bagels to loulas in that Skirmish and shut downbest rice place in the world and he will be able to move to a side length of light constant pressure of clothes he's just going to be interesting game to watch. Looks very focused around ruler flu limited for it's a lot of extra flap their the brown for the Frontline the only real big damn it said to Camille and not as threatening as a team fighter as a damage dealers are the ruler getting a lot of the pressure here on the team and certainly an incredibly top-class bottle in a ruler is super super incredible probably the biggest carry on the team I'm excited to see what he can do stuff against the best spot cleaner in the world and Megaforce and a star in his own right as well definitely all true statements here for a freak in the opener3/3 as well for Carson lease in this mid jungle to be to that you're talking about has so much potential the mobility of least in is very good in the Oval Office and have them one of you want straight up that will go to Owosso you really do have to get more creative and choose your opportunities there use the execution damage and make sure you actually finish off the kill I'm here Wego picks and Bans are done the lamps are secured and Royal never give up a 1-0 start Two Worlds the pre-tournament favorites going up against the defending world champion their second game of Worlds 2018 Genji was upset Yesterday by Europe's team Vitality but they can make a statement here today by taking down orange and we are out of the rim very very true if you lose the Korean. 1 and 4 I've never seen them have such a bad start to a tournament me why aren't you can make sure that China's State undefeated so far here in the group stage and it would be Genji fall in Korea one-in-four in their home country some irony that would be in for the home crowd but they will hope to keep their fans excited here for this one and look for a little bit of a semi on Vader when he was rushed with me for maybe a a trick board to come down or someone over stop slightly I like the trends that we're seeing the more teams willing to go for these level ones trying to get that advantage to open up the game we really big cascading effects throughout the early game so far nothing is happening in terms of inmates my kid would basically be bats level 1 champions in the entire game you can see Carson immediately respect backs off are they do scare his ghost for off that will put it on cool down so he won't have any more security and they drop off of work in the Raptor pit for getting a little antsy come down from Crown but Ming started with a sweeper and could get rid of that he wanted to help police then invade and indeed that will happen to 10 gold given over and compared with it would be done this one is how I was going to have himself a quick lube start so low as it typically isn't part of the same the top 7 the Red Bluff at the wrestler Camp contact would be looking to try and play towards the bottom side early with no Civic push is very strong an issue at the moment you walk down into the main page you're able to quickly take care of the first you melee menu definitely a rushing a little bit into the work they're does get the push for Uzi and then kills going out as well Guardian pretty standard therefore for JJ does black Elizabeth ship damaged well bit late actually Crown getting some nights glitter lamp is through the minion wave good base damage on her she can take a lot of these quick trade against a lot of mid laners for the main focus is still going to be playing with your junker in the early thing when it comes to miss exactly it's so much about the to be to around that midlantic drive faster route to set up moving fairly quick connect with Target but also the polymorph into an old run-down very very fresh and interesting he has of 13-track junglers in Korea the lowest jungle proximity was just time spent near his teammates in the first 15 minutes despite the fact that he puts out the least Gangsta sickly highest kills in assistant 15 per game of all the jungles in Korea when he gangster it works every time efficient fall off the time spent definitely not very high but the effectiveness is definitely there mean while all the other side car stuff he is running this dark Harvest which is gained a lot of momentum sister changes to electrocute for like a man that he should take it but there is a huge difference dark Harvest you have to stack up before you get your 100 50 Cent first hit only last 20 seconds after the last one that you just picked up Sophie was thinking that they're going to have a similar electrocute burst damage in early game and no skirmishes you don't really have to make it very quick after killing a jungle camp or picking one up there from a cannon in or someone died I can actually get that value otherwise you're going into combat without o'shoes part of why people use to take things like electric you on those type of Champions clear because it was Water by Gingy did the to Camp Red Bluff Crossing then he walked down to the wrist Guard rescue at that one just killed from swatting flies to post on us all focused on farming just wait for his food before we start doing anything we should know he might be at akademi Walter play the famous saying of let me always trying to just neutralize Tulane he's on the tank or we saw with wonders why you do not necessarily destroy sign in the early game get the two items and you will be such a massive threat in the timeline is that is the main goal for Camille is gold in the early game trying to build up your item once you start to get your GM at Bill your Trinity Force bill so you have first-hand that you have a always pushing on the waif then you get way more options you can take advantage of the Champions kit Camille with one of the longest engage ranges of any champion in League of Legends with your hook. Off the Wall towards a champion and X-Type ultimatum that start open up those opportunities one thing that does the price of it looking at this game is how much are India's pushing we'd only have to drink it for the village of their squads and have so far been able to not be touched by Harvey get to Harvard doesn't make a whole lot Steve do spend his time Bali that can do both average bottling ganker for lck standards and a spot I was texting to being so far though nothing much happening and if they would be safe in his bottom line it was coming untouched importance low there from crown on tooth shall who keeping his distance he's hiding this ride so that the roofers and doesn't go off what's that thing land that's where the least income it's all anime gets a big Bank around me like that he plays very well allowing animal off to take advantage of his very quick clear and how our farm truck scam on the bottom side now for how he's already level 5 concept was waiting for his Camp to respond that's why he looks about Midland but he is going to be pretty far behind an experience and we already mentioned that level 640 live with the Ludacris and run-down Shack if you win Midland Indians use that to go Portland and stop route from Free Willy soon now which is it that you just pushing the lame all the time he already is mostly a difference between the 280 calories but we know that the midline is still the focus so far so good for R&G they were able to do well on the bottom side of first overall the farm is quite nice on the Genji side with 500 gold ahead in the jungle being a very big part of that one 1/4 for now fighting the top titles with a channel not quite The Knockout do if you by not going to continue this fight as let me be able to do just fine on that prayed and camps to get little tapes on his own side don't have that she's smarter than men was looking around that Mainland to the queue there are two core JJ don't know if that small little visibility actually extend the horror of the name is pushing now could be that play but look how big is playing up you can jump back Tuesday make sure you stay safe just W's backward there's no way to stop that guy from getting out there no problem there and how it will have an unsuccessful get to the bottling rare pretty impressive and they're laying but it's not just the offensive play and they've been it's an ICS get that she has to leave for themselves into few already with their silver counterfeit but then also the defensive play their effortlessly almost debating and there's got to be a millionaire I just want to get out in 2 minutes just that all they just barely didn't have the extra damage do finish off the kill even with your Spotify pink eye from farts stupid gets out notice energy and how quickly to execute the combo cost at job said plastic holder from a sign that he was so much less DC right now see if you're not getting knockout from the Q and Q in Magic getting Raves near the wall he gets out in favor of Summoners in that trailer for JJ lost his summer nikhil of course it was ruler who brought TP to keep his face a little bit nicer to make sure those recalls weren't bad if it was going to take a long walk back here and it's not a cannon way which means he's been is Will's I rapidly men cannot reason for the pressure on him and it will be a lot of it has lost a lot for a movie that is very thick by Staying Alive top and getting the flash from Casa and then you're supposed to Fast Park Lane as well that was just so what's their him getting out because as I mentioned before the extra burst damage actually is there for cars that you finish off the red button before the 22nd dark Harvest actually fired he got there but
