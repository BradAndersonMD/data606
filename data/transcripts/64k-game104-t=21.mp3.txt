text coming into the playoffs they had the highest gold differences at 15 20 and 30 minutes of any LCS team ever still think have been this monster that other teams haven't even thought about taking down and so far they've been able to continue with a few different things to try and take this team doubt they picked all early game and game to as the animals dead Brokedown they still just lost they just got straight up out skilled buy C9 and some of those moments self I don't think it's a bad by any means and if there's a chance to run that back I think maybe that will make it happen three times in a row Cloud X Haley Banning away set not allowing these roots equalize the bull top of courses easy losing a game do they want to get your side flush in the against a on blue side you're hoping to the first pick will go well for them because the blue side game was the last close of the dudeplay so far. Clean things up and come through on the EEG sites I think that's definitely a possibility I'm happy that they got rid of the orange since they lost both sides of the ornash up and by changing up their bands C9 ended up dropping them a little bit and a filios gets through the band face For the First Time all series so like this for bang it's not necessarily something that is needing to be super lame dominant they can just turn on later and I'm hoping that you do push the focus in to other parts of the map and really I know it's failed miserably form the first two games but get something going in the mid jungle between Spence are ninjas UK because that's how they need to win dolphin Square looking like he's going back on the gragas had the option playing the pantheon now in the pantheon was picked one of us was banned away this time around they don't they still take set as without their favorite jungler in the now I got to figure out what support they want and they want to bring along side by side they have another strong duel in their urine game three foods you watch ESPN without having to push the brake pedal and I think this is the first time they've actually matched it again because as you mentioned It's a Jungle not there for the side of T9 and atrox already locked-in so even though she is opting out of the Orange versus X matchup they're opting into giving licorice a power PICC and being able to bed also note that like Zoe still up so I do think that maybe EG she just likes to throw a little bit in there like just in case since about a I think something is still in for a doozy rubber bands for stop there going to be pushed down a little bit I am curious what it looks like not on the Nocturne very clearly 591 play the champion a lot a lot of time and they brought out of respect for them so do you want to see what it looks like on someone else did the game's play a little differently we are seeing more fighter band so try to drop to mow down I feel like now Kaiser to the list I don't think it's a great matchup overall yeah that's probably where people goes to be honest and I don't think he's practiced it but the pic I would actually recommend would be malphite Fanatics latest today over in the LEC and you can just Stack Up stuck in a certain amount of armor early that you can stop him from being able to sleep and you be able to alter onto a Beres but that runs into Tulsa problems later because Ben could just go AP varus and you can also consume them off at altamed so you will eventually get out scaled it's going to be hard almost no matter what its I feel like it's actually little, but they banned up the Camille just cuz I don't think that Kuma would win that match up their base me to saying we don't even need this final ban against Cuomo and I think it's a it's a bit of a posture from seeing eye all right so Pantheon comes through certainly a very strong jungler and we'll see what I can do with this one so it's going to be very very rough Pantheon game some of that still has a global ultimate get to anytime he wants you to go see one out of nowhere from thin air and Doctrine a bit more going to grab that one regardless he's digging the top of a pick-and-pop comes through the Top Lane take Pickens yeah it's actually only going to be third Zoe game of the split his one and one on it so far but I think it's needed to take it and oh man if that's see it let's see if this key lock in the rides like if they win the first date rocks or neat rocks rise do easily rise Orion Oaks kassadin casantica. They want early pressure Pantheon Tulia well-known strong do over mid jungle we're going to win super hard early game I expect there is talk 1020 really lame I expect in the early Lane and you got em too and think about how much this team can ship on the map like the global pressure of the Tom Kent being able to take his bearing buddies and then Pantheon Leah flying anywhere they want so much total shutdown to any type of map pressure that is UK tries to apply and split push so what was eegee's greatest strength throughout the end of the split when they're on the big winning streak it was their ability to split the map and do one tree one in every single draft that she is done they figure this out they pick Nocturne they picked on Kent there was throwing the cherry on top with a Julia in this final draft still with eg wins it's not going to be trees Flatbush yeah ever go see if they can kind of make it what happened meanwhile Cloud out of course have a very early game skewed draft I am a little concerned about this feeling if it does mystically get to 28 minutes with a C9 average that you do 1500 gold lead in the first 15 by 3000 gold in the first 15 minutes and then nearly or in some cases from there so I will see what can happen to your Cloud I have the game for breaking out pretty quickly in and just for a little bit more historical context done what she is doing so far in the spring split their only been two other team to ever go 17 and one in the regular season it was 2016 spring Immortals and 2016 Summer TSM 2016 Summer to invest in threes so they actually had more game losses when do teams went into playoffs Immortals actually got out of the playoffs and then TSM went 3-0 in the seventies and 3-1 in the finals with C9 has been doing is there currently 500 in the playoffs and because of the new playoff format wood could potentially go now I know the last time you seen actually went undefeated in an NA LCS playoff was back in the summer split of 2015 when CLG did it in route to their first title so historic stuff to C9 is looking like they might be doing if they can continue this dominance closeout UD 3300 here and we want to find afford a half years since our last undefeated playoff Champion blabber going for early play play Nice List template liquor store Copley ready to go I appreciate the thought for the idea of hey we expect flowers to start them band Raptors let's set a trap for him problem is the Trap was sprung and he wasn't under the little pinwheel the little you know that the battle ever came down he's like on 3 million. Mention the goals of course dropped as well liquor can of soda off the wave yeah and they actually gets Diesel's exhaust on top of all of it is so strong level one that I mean you can't LC9 is going for the jugular likes counter jungling Raptors that early in the game as the pantheon is like a big bet about where Spence Karen going to start an actually was wrong with the fact that didn't get punished is a little bit miraculous cities take me to tractor the jungle he's probably doing you know Raptors read drugs than topside so I'll just take your top 10 before you do it we expect a faster speed yeah yeah you know he can certainly try but for now blaberus more than comfortable in his jungle pathing and with his Raptors of to Camp gone back to clear a flapper is Pats have been awesome what a lot of times Crockett's is do is L-3 Camp right side recall to get their Predator boots because then their initial gang is still high threat but blabber having discharge I can get full control the Scuttle crab if you really want is not the highest experience play but will be a higher mattress place you could actually double Scuttle in this case to Dino's as I settle for this game and that is the rock hitting the back of the head he just walks away Dead all summer's gone and a wave crashing into the turret that spends going to show up to pick up and they know it a full box light clear and take whatever you want and get to kill mid you say has an exhaust do you still want to take that trade but this whole series has been playing Lane like he has someone can for him and she just hasn't it's always been blabber there instead of Spence Karen and that's what happens yet again spell attempted fight down here or basil unable to block the piece of mirror from the vents of things would it have to be to have to walk down the bottom but poor guy got the clear midlane and take Walton look and now stuck talking about a side light flash pick up there Vulcan who is reasonably Tanki why do does nisky why was going towards the back side has been want to rejoin his old lady's going to be pushed back when he will stay alive EG make the fight work as a Botley and what a huge stop that is for EG if we go back to the whole series what usually happens the first batting happened and then they try another early gang in a little bit of desperation and that fails to this time it's actually work they played this extremely well from the get-go so they don't Predator until he's actually out of fog so they don't have time to react they get through it and look in the patient has been scared of body slam early right they know that that's wrong son is still going to be on spend so post watch they can still kill him and then why was little bit greedy he's trying to save his powers what tastes unlock him before he can get his Empower Steve and brush him down from that moment show a little bit of a Miss play from blabber for sure they had been dead to rights and they finally converted play let me go back to the rest of the bath now so I can take a look and look at the facts that kills buster gold because they're winning the length by so much is 19 tsp in the bot Lane 10 up and topside with again Liquors going early cold to make that cash in later on everything Google possibly could look at the depth here and there doesn't matter Cloud 9 or still just slobbering the early game he was going to send it to take the Dry Falls Bend schools at Fort Lee there's more yes I mean is this is why it's so hard to be Cloud 9 as they always find the way to apply the most pressure possible we do have to keep in mind what we talked about in the draft if this gold stays close in to the late game EG will have a chance because of the hanky next to Poppy can bring in the late game and more importantly just the immense damage of a late game of Fellowship we protected by Brahm so yes seen I had the little bit of a misstep with getting to Des bottom but their foot is straight back on the gas pedal and licorice please summer, is push off the wave has take a long walk back and now in the mid lane as the rest of the squad there. There's the knockback nothing you could to actually get a jungle bright like this is how Pantheon jungle is supposed to oppress the opponent mid laner just UK falling prey to the second straight Pantheon game Lita's back to 1300 I feel like we've seen these numbers before this stage of the game Cloud 9 doing it again and again and again if you had to push down the middle Lane that's why do you want to defend midline would you like this wave of minions here as I'm pushing it down it looks juicy as a hundred gold here right now to safety and this is where things get really hard for EGT
