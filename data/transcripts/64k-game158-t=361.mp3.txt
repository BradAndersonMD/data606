there goes one of my right now I think there were going to at least be upgrading their Academy theme in a kind of over the years they've been trying to fill this out and and create more of a system from which they can pull players up to their LCS Squad I think that's something a lot of the team did not all the teams really should be working on because you can find such a valuable player one really strong player that is a North American player that can be so valuable in the ALCS because that's a really don't need to import that's a rule that is really really worth a lot was watch the first pick up Elias they'll both be on the table like a collie and rumbel we're looking around what they might really want to do it yeah cuz his give me the Pick he is a very very strong later his face as a super low but his spells do so much damage is choosing 145 damage in that basement level twocast the paperwork you have to leave to get to Berkeley off and auto attack does a whole lot of course actually cared up with his dad has a very big deal gorica skid play afelio to yesterday again had a great game fun at 519 who he was Dead Poets on the broth that aired up with a bellios wife are the most and it's also actually very good into MF using that at Braum's Shields are to block out the ultimate so I would be very surprised if both Gardens don't grab from here that's also good at 2 or not I really think it's it's kind of a bit of a Mystic if you're not going to grab that really on because it's that can also be taken away by five 9 and yep yeah I mean you have to bring up Pandora and it's like screaming take from pairs well with a belly oh so I think it was only picturessing at least you with all this stuff right but the NFL come through I feel like it's so much harder for you also to be in the right place at the right time every time feel the Block Please add fpv that was paired to Bomb by fromis is very consistent remind me of the shield you just jump back to 80s of Those Nights by the way doesn't really matter what we do have an Ori grabbing me Olaf he's going to be able to have a lot of her also taking a lot of jumpers do light because it is for the junglers that if you like to go that route can actually powerform very very heavily doing antennas keep up more and golden experience with those Bowl winners that has complained of most if not all junglers these days as they feel that they are still under levels compared to the rest of the game so I will see how an orrery want to try to play this outbut yeah I'm looking at you know the jungle and then Gangsta Lane with about two axes and even try to run down to mordekaiser who is going to try to walk away very slowly I mean if you want to do that they're going to have to drop some more gangstas here or at least an option to go up to that top side but the more pictures of very good matchup you know especially if they are not going to get into rupted up and do that horn Oriana good blind pick and it does kind of work well with you all off with the speed up but again you're not the most powerful gang cats it though and let their last tech support pick your diamond that is really going to be kind of calling in Horry down to that bottom Lane didn't really have a ton of options on where to go and and those types of cases I tend to think the plan becomes pushing your lanes allow him to Whole Lotta Rosie jungler route map in here for heart my mind goes to Leona number one most advanced support intro play so far this patch she is left up for my can tell it's a bitand would work quite well tonight. But if you just want to go Leona and play take the board into another tank 4th then it's pretty surprising to me that you are acting too blind pick your midline do it is going to be fun with the Oahu you can actually speed them up and throw a bump on his head he can run in and actually extends I've been kind of a the wife of the Olaf in the game because a lot of people talk with all of his falling off very heavily late-game if you have a billion behind you you actually can have his late-game relevant the attic damage from the bomb Is wealth revive in the GF give you the ability to take out something scaryDerek Billy have a plan here if it's two different email Mages to support a noise Olaf he's going to go Cleaver II item budget upgrade that for him as well like we're going to see in Horry jokes about I do cop right here a lot of damage Victorino is very good at fellios is the most prized but later said you got more damage to the stadium with with talk to her that's really good up there as well yeah it really should I will say it does usually take an item for to completed before you can really start bullying you and will not match up early as bored but it has the ability to to do a fill-in to win last in a surprising fashioned against many many match up so you have a little bit more, behind you if you can get up to something like literally liandry's then it becomes incredibly powerful the profanity he with that on top of your passive you're stealing the fast when you open men's that's when you can really start to take over and looksplay that style I think that's only said Zion Spartan know what kind of know for back in the days though they be looking for a little bit that's why are looking for a little bit of cycling dominant will be playing soon don't worry too much about this one go to go to academy in Cloud 9 Academy going to be doing battle soon enough diamond and I'll chat r a d c is Boom great I love that they're probably some sort of issue there 4K out hopefully get right back in again pretty quickly but the war in solo queue it is from you know when I have seen it and played it myself a fairly weak support in the early levels really all you have is is that your Mom's done right and if you actually can't hit that you're very skeptical to all Lids you have to think that they're going to have to lose quite possibly the only kind of real option they have is is just run a hard shove and reset and not really interact with their opponents if you're trying to play a bit more up utilizing you know that the kind of a weed image from the bombs on the mini wave but you're playing at the Valley West Bromwich has incredible gang cyst and at least it so if you're pushing or putting yourself in such a vulnerable spot with no gravity of root of the Bron passes done know that that type of thing does connecting and you can just be screwed well I'm going to take a quick break to the council desk as raza's satisfied with all of them as she runs the interview guys I am running the interview is just going to have to deal with it all right this isn't I know you're the new coach of Golden Gardens Academy very exciting for you we don't get to see on the casting desk anymore but I want to talk about your team tell me about this roster because it's the first time I've ever seen him onstage driving honestly the moment I got into the gym and we had our first meetings super, individuals all of them smart soft-spoken all of them were able to have on his conversations with each other and it makes it super easy for Gorka you know the rookie coming into the team to really act Lemay to the situation so I think it's a perfect team set-up you guys have a lot of veterans on the team do they kind of adopted a teacher-student mentality with Gorga after every game and scram could just like to have long conversations with Pookie and they can just trade ideas like I think it's honestly one of the best situations for a rookie to come in with there hasn't been any hazing there has their absolutely not they have to go through me by the way I will let it happen he's not going to let it happen. Last question for you, I'm kind of curious about the philosophy with the golden Guardians and switching around are potentially switch around any lcsn Academy players cuz we seen a couple teams do it before in the past is that something that you think is there is potential for is always potential but I think stability for all players is what they want because they want to set themselves up to succeed so if it makes sense then that's going to be the conversation but we always give players on the main theme in the academy team the chance of the academy team wants to be given the chance to be stable with this roster go back to the Caster's it would be good interview buddy really well done rising up back in the day back when they used to throw out bearing all the time so we can salt it you know he was he was one of the coaches that allowed the team to throw out bearing whole lot will see if it's different this time around Dickies infected to Golden Gardens Academy start with that and so far so they're safe sadly King could not connect the Wii remake the lobby players all hop out we make a new one players all hop band and then we try around 2 and hopefully can this time we'll make it in hopefully you'll be able to get this going pretty quick should be able to fly through picks and bans wants everyone is in the lobby but it is actually really fun seeing Raz coaching in a cat is the guy who is great we've obviously works with a lot over the years casting of insulin it's really fun for me to see him there and I wish him all the best but thus far you know they are undefeated so 100% win rate for as with the Golden Gardens got me so far as we're only 9 game of the season so far, it's otherwise Team Canada is Team Canada from top it all the way down to coach I would I would almost be no want to play in French but like they're not all french-canadian it says like no reason to be really disappointed if you could only Far Eastern Canada conversion in elvive course but not a lot so you think he's going to be Grease 3 typical Canadian culture to be very aggressive towards other people and you know it's one of the country is a fellow Canadian play I took a bunch of notes for this game really stupid for example what are my notes was ironic that we've got Cloud fees it's not a very good point like I mentioned I think it's funny you're right that's Bobby what else can I do on a Raspberry I mean the Raptors maybe maybe you Rebrand basketball Toronto Raptors so you know she never went again Toronto alright so we are getting through the picks and bans and hopefully we'll have this going for you very quickly wow who could have seen this coming. Everybody or that yep all right what final drive to be locked in at least then gets crab in the final Champion is the Victor and then Diamond locks in the pocket Pig zillion gazillion is I think not enough players consider going Relic Shield instead of spell thieves now I think zillion actually needs a man region I think he's such a manner hungry Champions you actually need the man of reason that bail fees now gives in 10.1 on words but if it wasn't important one word the oldest out of his health health in a p I would consider going Relic Shield just because I'm not going to land her ass very easily all the time especially when Broncos can actually get some fuel pressure like just Auto attack for Relic Shield products like who cares what the difference is like 15 1800 ml but it's actually use for that cuz I am someone who goes Relic Shield in a sports is just if it is a match up where you have to play defensive we're not actually able to trade consistently then Relic Shield is is going to serve you better right kind of similar to if you're playing coin in somebody's defensive matchups prior right if you're playing on me or something and it says to Progressive match up where you can't trade you if we don't know I do think at least in the early levels is pretty easy to actually proc off of Brom I'm not sure which way he will go Relic Shield you know could work pretty well I have seen some zilean support even do things like Relic Shield and identity r n t r u feeling like hatch need a man of this badly that I'm glad she brush aside and then not really complete at Unity Redemption whatever and those types of things can work pretty well but it's a very heavily scaling build on a very heavily feeling Champions you're really kind of like back loading your power out towards later in the game so which way Diamond wants to go he is playing Arie he is going Cosmic Insight so wouldn't be surprised if this gets his balls Man full band kind of help out with some of those men issues and we'll find out pretty quickly if he's going to go spell thief's end he is there with all the pretty everybody Sports Battlefield and all that kind of stuff so yeah he's
