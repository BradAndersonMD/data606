play offs after game 2 just cuz it looks like there was no way that this t19 could be slowed down and mention the last time Blue's Clues so we know they're at least a little bit mortal it took a lot for you to win that game they were down over 5000 gold able to clutch back-to-back device to take it back so now she has retaken blue side there's no way e g is getting that first pic of Kelly O's and let's see if seen I can pull them out without sealed his records stays still make it a convincing Victory gear they still had the best of any team in the league Fife are fine but now he might say Hey will take your time difference is Ben barres you heard the animals kept talking about the damage permanent difference between been and being last game and it was over 400 because really spent didn't have any impact in the game and okay they would Crank That is Provera to that is your work going for Kent and trying to get picture of him again and see if I'm not having more engaged to lose more weight to play aggressively on last game but they faltered by mid-game a mom cat so we got here once again a decent cop vs jungle if those UFC on ESPN commercial break for the stick around and last time we saw the atrox blind in the second phase of band was actually last game of the two bands of Cloud 9 throughout was Renekton and Camille but the poppy actually showed a large amount of spectrum is so if we're looking to see something similar from this round where liquor she trying to get has been Avenged of possible that's what we see but actually since EG will have first dibs on whatever midday want if they opted not to counterpick they're just romantic Azucar yeah I like the slaughter band continues on a whole lot of sense I want to see what is licorice lose that match against boom players who won their first best advised to get here gold difference in the first 10 minutes of the game the only play with a week laning phase regardless of that like egms you were still able to pick up with that's good but I did leave your licorice going to win that anyway with the caliber flare you are still Cloud 9 prefer to Spanaway or let's neutralize licorice last game and 10:25 afterwards yep completely agree it's it's working in the favor of EG most likely to allow promo to play weakside and still be effective when it comes to the team fight phase 4 really going to see the rest of the scene on, come together here they banned out many mid laners and now have two blind pick something for misky misky had a really diverse champion pool probably have to bring me here so we won't be able to play a male a champ like Diablo Warner Elliot yeah I mean like Spencer Diana what you got time yes. That's the one and it's it's technically Affleck's pic to if they really want to stroll ramble top and let the atrox gomed depending on what does UK decides to match him with so let's see have had to be a little bit different is this is the first draft person has had a true answer for LG split push last game they had an overwhelming amount of split push answers with activate the vulnerable in team fight but the Nocturne band here to Tom kench take away means it's 9:00 is actually the stronger team in team fights and zouke might be unlocked to get a little bit more split pushing done even get to that stage that personally I would like to see Cloud 9 switch the locations of liquid to see in this game by the crumble coffee is pretty abusive everyone else but she has a great time citing her I think also a check to look pretty good in the Echo you can at least get away from the Sun cages so the players are going to stalk Champions against fine keep Liquors and more reps on it smells like feels players flop Lane I mean it's definitely possible it hasn't been something to see 9 has really done any of its generally they're the team that swaps champ rather than swap player last your Tod experiments a little bit was swapping Clair Lanes in one of the I think the third-place Play-Off match but more largely since I do think it will be nisky in the mid lane here this is a really interesting matchup because there's actually a lot of debate about whether or not Echo as a counter picking to rumble we had this earlier on in the year when I think it was p o e play crumble into Echo smashed through here on in the year though over in the LPL rookie had played Echo into Rumble and actually gotten multiple solo kills on him so there's definitely some skill match up their Echo pen at some point smacked the wave clear of Rumble but more importantly if you can get into mid game with equal items Echo starts winning the side lane so that's what you doing again it's going to be about whether or not that mid jungle can stand up for EG in trying to set this kid behind we have to see right away we're going to have a pretty standard looking early game we've seen a lot of a lot of invade these early game usually late invades around you know 128 and you suddenly walk-in look for the play had a couple of counterpunches both sides and as lava comes topside with creeper there they could easily see this ward in ghosts or the invade the ECM do so often actually gives the experience and the extra gold over licorice at the Smart play when one person to each other person feels about you both got the goal for the ward and let's see if we can pull up something devastating on Spence Karen here because Allah is one of the strongest early-game duelist in the game and also one of the fastest clears so he would have an opportunity to really sets been scaring behind if you can predict the right calls and take a large Camper vans and do it again I looked up as you're messing up Midland Magic looked up what are you online computers for the expected remorse Echo match up 1.3% less often than expected which means that they tend to be in solo queue 1.3% of additive when we don't get me wrong but in general at home play the Flames. Pretty on that a lot of really game push also knowing that his own jungler has swept out the red buff I'll be gragas so he's not worried about an early game Predator games as of yet but the echo at least not since it's kind of favor but if you're thinking about what's the more common propik it's definitely will happen here and as we go through the very early parts of the game we're going to have a small quick to can't believe parole office is expected no up against course. Steal away some pants I'm curious how much more efficient blubber can be as the camps are responding there is not a level before the Olaf they're both going to be 3 for the Scuttle butts so is the crack has been as leverage drops towards the way he's got the schedule in the correct size and I want you to stop that fella play yeah just tons of overwhelming lost power but it's Penske I can sneak in the right spots you try to go faster than blabberbuzz leprosy hurt but they found the back and forth both teammates have be relocated to have to do the predictive lash Genie feels like we can follow through and I'll fight them inside of windshield for Suzuki but this can trade right back after it and win that prescribe is blank Highly Questionable Bodyslam there by 10 scared to go in when bladder is right there with the level Advantage so I think I lucky to get out of that was just a flash burned is big and pretty cheeky with those trades in the middle and time to react well to cancel okay pictures almost killed afterwards but he stays alive for now but knows he has geekin by the way licorice walkthrough The Vision radio suspense care as blue cakes at the end you really just wanted to shut out the way because I don't I can't see the exact experience Barber chance he could have his stick there was a hole in the bottom Lane home an interesting what what could have been a really big moment for did you say I think it's not because he's still lost a big waves only got 20 CS it at 5 minutes and now they might kill licorice who burnt plastic kill finally a cake of the topside is rewarded a great then the knockback words stay safe keep the farm going but easy of ethical to kill their only son to go down they're still in it as they are still in the series after picking the skin off for me to watch a silica one more time to level 4 vs. level for Misty wants to Finish dish of so he can reset but he actually doesn't get hit by the return on the echo q but still ends up losing the trade despite bring the night so you could see what a dangerous game he was doing trying to shove them back away but changes and get the kill bladder ever aggressive actually out of the brakes is gold more snacks down to the bottom side Sven and Vulcan field they're both down here in this matchup with that kills but it's up to us to see which got to feel nice and shoving that way even walk around yeah and the greatness of our observers to catch always blitzcrank hooks makes it feel like Vulcans Landing everything down bottom that a big point of power for C9 bottom Lane and is kind of pulling blabber towards that side of the map for the overall control of it just like it sounds good but it is definitely still in it I mean I can get this place going on I feel like Spence here is going to Safeway farming to level six and unless you know can orchestrate a dive bottom here with Rumble off easy might be able to stabilize I think we have a really big moment coming up if if C9 price to use this current middling push from Rumble and do something bottomley I guess I could find a friend right now yeah I guess no no big play being done right now what is the oldest to come through it to be very soon but the Cloud 9 dueling down here Spencer and licorice going to trade blows Hilton from space but just Evite come through when's The Equalizer but they know he can find his way back over the wall so not going to have to just get to do get rain gauge points of damage does d as liquor Strikes Back has COPD and now back to the slow mode going to slowly make his way back over but will 6 on both drunk just bite the camp different Spence care if it walked away and see what's going on but doesn't even have to burn ultimate and I think he was losing this Rift Herald anyway after Spence Karen got Junk to work as lube up a really weird feeling I have in the series where we keep saying like Osteen on is technically have on this play what it feels like they could have been more ahead on the place so maybe you should feel happy about it you know what I mean because you're insecure and misky was able to all back to the wave to continue to keep pressure up and seen I just hasn't completely run away with it yet and just weak side poppy is still unkilled right so there are scaling up in these important parts and yusuke still even gold with misky so at least he's he's game plan is still intact because I group your point right to the one to the one hand we've been kind of tempered we've been given this pavlovian response as well but here's The 3 Tails out of why is it not three kills the bell rang what do you mean by the same time 3 where was a 5000 change the texture to games every single time but anytime or C9 are not closing down if he doesn't believe you like well okay maybe they really are just blowing down or teams of freaking out a little bit or yeah and I talked about this for a lot of split when
