standard goldendoodles contract when he was already on the academy team this is why don't they are staying with Viper in the Top Lane deer as well and he has his work cut out for him all right off the bat I like a t t Target band Phoenix no azir will make it through that's one of the most important things to bet against big dots of course the other one everyone's going to shout Viper eat in the game keep ribbon within your mind usually teams will use their second-round advance to go after vipers ribbon not feeling like they are going to early pick it because we need to try and counter pic real quick and then what that one through other side is both are basically Champions the rumble and Gangplank for a man for me biggest one obviously is going to be this do E4 goldenglue he has had his best games by far on that champion and what most teams that actually ban the rubble and left Gangplank up for honeycontinue to pick it and continue to win with it great he is Haiti a leader of all 15 players who have played on dignitas or EG so far this split the money is the man doing all the work type per second is his Lane make bang bang also time for second by the way at the top player not playing lower on the other side? There but regardless I hope they can pass know what's going on with this one has a fellows walked into 20. Suppose a little while ago full of air has only been played by a Viper so far has not had a game from Dar. So you can slightly expect stop laying there and then I think it would be a lock in for each she has played literally just Affiliates and Azrael every single game except for the one little weird Center game that they had other than that though one of these to Champion every single time that he does it again immediately locked in a belly or no questions asked with Azraeland it's very it's a very small just didn't read a guitar tab for out as far as that 80 karrie pick and he's been so consistent and caring with them it's very reliable obviously ashes amourjayda V Premier pic into a failure to both due to the rain to Bandon Lane but also a sharrow select easier to land on that champion there for the case there of course we are still in 10.14 movies out here are not in this past year so probably totally proviable next patch regardless to give that man some more spaced teeth as they still play his first fresh game of the split Phoenix Oriana Odyssey solid we know Jonathan play the sound of a should be just fine there okay been at the day then it's pretty easy for dig I think if if he don't try and grab that for Golden gluten in round one not only is it golden glue specialty but Zoe also does fight well until Oriana as far as most champions in Lane do with the range Advantage there so I thinktake to have an easy band hear the Rhythm band we already mentioned so all going according to plan so far for this champ select do you mean on Yelp Bowie and then Gangplank is the other big dick that's been great for Hootie that would be the easy priority for me we'll see if they have other plans here though there is the game play be alright meanwhile other side of Yugi following up your Ribbon band because you're probably still never mind how could they still looking at buy for the topside most people are only worried about his ribbon and if he can move Barbie curvy tonight from aphromoo things I've been harping on in the dick games they need to have dardoch on something that can force plays and aphromoo that can Forrest Gump play so I like the thresh deal from ege even though they did have to give up early taking this doughy they'll get another chance at it here I think that should be a no-brainer for them and they didout of Bard and threats to app remove should go a long way there maybe they'll go to aphromoo some sort of like Leona are Nautilus or something because games in a row they have had my stuff that cannot create ways and what are the games look like freak news best ya engage tools on the border Tulsa Shock Wave after it starts up but do you want to see Jonathan a little bit aggressive player would like to see a man strong jungle matchup of course the boulevard May well be his we're going to see Zoe not locked in for give gold and blue his third unique Champion across board games the galio come through easy. I like it every since they increase the range of Blitz book I feel like there's a lot more angles that you can go for it specially around the river she can join people over walls pretty easyplay with with a lot of people trying to make rotation to Scuttle crab and stuff and obviously I do mention it's pretty frequently picked into thresh because you know what GameStop in place and we will have to eat the cookie counter their graves picked up for Doc it's definite offensive jungle and they have plenty of specie elsewhere so they are going to flex that volibear to the top very strongly feel even after the attack speed nurse and of course the W nurse for only few jungle Camp so it doesn't hurt too much there I like the free eegee's save toppling for last leave the set Flex pickup Replacements Karen you are on Cinder hooktheory on this one can meal toppling to beat up Viper he must be confident in his full of air mass have iMovie novela bear is an incredibly, what are the most picked operators in Pro League of Legends you got to have it match of practice when he says don't worry Camille is the pic for me they threw a couple of bands by Rubblebucket Click by Jay-Z argon kamila's neck don't worry I got this and look at the engaged to writeshow me Chevy's to run forward and be the Galleria Target comes down from Camille you cannot get away from the galley or knock up go to glue can easily follow up and there was a bounce house ready to go for bang to just breathe fire on the back line as far as actual champion dive there's not a ton there's Volver Shockwave and that's kind of it otherwise I feel like being is fairly safe to do a bunch of damage the backlight key of a damaged cheerleader in the LCS he is going to be set up in the stamp and he almost always performs cuz I think that the initiative in the team fights is going to be huge in this game you know whoever is going to get your controllers in place first so that you can be the one with the blitzcrank pool or you can be the one delivering the Shockwave combo first that's going to go such a long way because like you're talking about we have some of the ideal Champion combination for those Big Y Mambo set up both teams have built Arsenal's to take on these Dragon fights so I think we're going to be in store for some some excitement this gamegoing to be a positive change from the last couple of of the games that you do fans have been crying about this one I I'm going to guarantee it right now just after 10 select this was going to be way better for a little bit slow off the start in the first one but they are going to look a whole lot better here I like to see it happen keep in mind on the lights are currently games out of playoffs there to do they have five games left to play Counting this one so do their key opponents they must at least pick up two wins if those other squads go 0 and 5 otherwise make it three make it 4 but they have to improve now if they have to pick up some wins in the very end of the split that is the road here for dignitas on the EEG side they are three games behind Team Liquid for a playoffsVice ability very difficult to make that runs but they can hope to do it otherwise he's going to be kind of stuck in that 326 section and we'll see you in the first round we are on a toothache and du Freak I really wanted that fly to I was talking earlier just like about extending the hook range for blitzcrank write something that's most solo queue games where there is a b c l o with a voice crack in it you can go to that Russian people often spend their support player in this defensive position that was the banana Bush where is daisa was sitting and you can hook them before they can react out of that midlane side brushed with new blitzcrank but I think they did not actually fire it off I was sitting here jumping eyes you are talking did the happening and we'll have to wait a little bit longer for the excitement I still hold true on my promise this one is going to be more excited than previous onesand we already had that Demonte versus dig Revenge but they've got dropped because of the big contract in money that was attached to keeping this player around and sent to Nene traded a way to Evil Genius has spent a small amount of time on the academy team in immediately has been moved into the LCS Squad he could not make thick pay him in cash but maybe he will be able to make them pay it was an LCS win that's a pretty good it's already been a good start for the new lineup on Evil Geniuses 2 and 1/2 record with hunie and gold and blue in the lineup and new chips are both them here and there for the game on this team and you got really pushing for gold and blue kind of shutting down the lane going to buy some of Phoenix's farm and there we go it'll most recent threat or Phoenix can just take some Auto Tags and keep the land in a bad spot show up on the wrong side of the plane on the way van shouldn't be too badyeah I like the move from Cincinnati to get Vision first before retreating down to the bottom Scuttle crab because it's pretty hard to kontest Graves on those If he if he tries to meet up and you start to use any abilities on a scholar craft first and you have nothing left to try and get that $0.05 go to those pushing them and what they look back and drive cuz he'll be careful exhausted on cleanse it away goes for the smoke screen and then Spirits here around as what we like that combo I got a credit app for Lisa okay sniper Laden with a gravity off him and my Boyz II Men Let me take that hook and trade it back good play my Afro Johnson could not talk to you until after I pee before it until it afro specifically this guy's been playing so much better in summer split then we had with a Teleport top the foursome off of the minion wave though early flash out of Viper because goldenglue is here that wave is getting denied and that is allfor the Viper will not on I-78 minions now all eight minions they're denied by the goldenglue teleport melee for his efforts baby to probably right before we saw screen but definitely a decent help or even though they don't get the Kill by force flashes down is teleport it was also expanded trying to get back there and of course as you mentioned to some out of that experience denied now there is a Camille one trick on European West where he's got really good informative match up videos for every matchup for Camilla comes out with one every day and even though I don't play top way I've been watching that he's just so good at explaining other little intricacies in every Camille matchup I haven't turned into the volibear wide but I recommend that you definitely go check it outthis time around he's he's gone for a grassroot almost always recommend going conqueror or press the attack Concord ghost so well for Camille obviously in melee melee matchup practice so much. Write this is Major Lane way easier and you can see us to tack up the grass on the minions you can go for your W Landis low plus to heal and even with a control you can get your crap Auto attacks off do I got some damage on the bottom side is. Excluding fudge making sure the pot leaves not getting dope anytime soon foot Comey I feel like a little bit I'm not trying to sell you out cuz obviously I've watched four of them wait for this is to be going to burn the cleanse away to come not just yet but still gets a lot of damage in cannot quite land to Prudhoe part of the punches being watched by a two-headed Health left buttock easy fight them is laying for the help our leader of the EG yeah I want for them just because you don't ask curious and I always like getting to know high rated Talent your insights but the volibear what I don't know if it was there or if it was super far down but they all have their little even your way straight on and stuff like that the orange one was pretty informative as well definitely recommend checking him out but again Dragon picked up here for thanks Karen actually are they going to do anything about it I control it inside the bit but I know they finish their recall so it is going to be E G Dragon no problem really far left over the bottle and he's like hey ya bass like I can come over but we have no idea what Ashton what's are doing all right cool we see or difficult sometimes right when you like okay we don't have vodka tour right now this could be tough but they had to go to the right and you can be just fine with that one soeg small gold good job back there for this one but otherwise you got to say Drake is going to feel good. Keeping up just finding and Spencer and I see first level six. This might takes down all of that you can feel really good about the chickens being is paper on the Move might get a red pustules well he's definitely going to get it I mean Phoenix has control over mid to push gold and blue under the tower so good pushier again another instance of laners. counter jungling Golden Goose China collapse I doubt whether he's got to be careful has flash but no old is there going to be a re-engagement hook might come down or play at least you can get a self write for the flash for the tots and a hook to make a little aggressive but they is eg kitten
