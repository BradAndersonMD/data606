that's true we're here and we are already underway in Champion Select your for the first game of the day echo-fox with their silly changed up brought their gear Mike young moving back in VLC s back on stage and be hunting for his first win with Echo Fox hope they turn it around 4 at the old being with Rush was that he would never lose on Sundays but true bass record so far currently in last place we could have turned things around with nine games to flag has not been so good recently why but we know they have the talents to go back up and I mean a lot of people have been pointing towards their bot Lane as as that weekend step Lionel a had not been performing up to the standards that we are you through from them and I think that's a big reason why we're seeing FBI as well to he squatted in in that bottom Lane yesterday and it did not work out for them either they did get very far behind but certainly I think a lot of the credit was it from me.he was there for all the counter Gangsta they were going to force on the bottom side and arrow got so fed on this Draven so interested to see a second appearance your for FBI and who he and find out if they can actually match up well against Parliament Aqua I was like to believe in New Edition so I'm still stoked for Mike young still stoked for FBI and who he and we'll see who can have a better results here today both you 4th did lose on Saturday 21st that much of a surprise bill on 9.12 definitely Queen of the Jungle and the most craft phases in early Lux here expecting us to be support for who he other at the possibility of it being placed around there it has also been in the cademy and then some other areas working some gragas support who he actually being one of the guy who had played this little bit away is going to be a great if you have 200 cough so they are actually taking the yasso away from Golden Guardianyour draft and you do have to knock up salon size it's as well write the cute eyes actually a knock up there from 2:20 that allows you to all of knowledge are you a multi minakov evening out as Folk has a slight little grab that you can all the off of so we'll see what the weather is going to be and it will definitely is making me feel that this is probably a Sephora in that bottom Lane playing alongside of you know pretty aggressive a d e r I think you could play it with lots but make a little bit less than me cuz didn't really want to go for the support of all in style of play If you are going to be drafting quit that at the pro level only the way it's too aggressive Lane as a grown up or FBI Lucien yesterday and did have an early CS leave with me as a counter gang Center in that laying around but it's still the same sort of look for the golden Guardians do overly Lena crashing through the game power as you're saying about the gragas being elected support that does seem to line up he had one on earlier so far that splits is one of his better chanceVolkswagen still wait to see what comes out of the end still possible for Less reflex around right you know you could still put that in the jungle you could still put the lock before it based on what the matchups are based on what has actually been selected for Echo Fox though Advantage there in terms of flexibility I think of where the things are going at the osmo you could theoretically be going to three lanes but Apollo does not really strike me as a player I've not seen solo really play it either so I'm certainly expecting a decision bidlane yasso here forever. I may be one of their players will prove me wrong but for now I think that is where I will be assuming it's going I think that's where he's going to Sue is going as well as champion in as many games and wait to see if that is indeed what happens here is the final bands come through Nico and a collie band outs they are expecting solo to still have his top cleaner to grab later on we're seeing Brown Band of wipes in case there's a pillow support to be seen in LeBlanc away from frog in a case that Lexus down there just kind of covering both basesnever know for sure if blind Renekton going to come through and came to the osawa so you could actually be taking his Renekton and give it a Haunter and just have him follow the author on the map for either so lame so you're that is a very strong early matchup you also relies pretty heavily on being able to be very evasive on actually look out playing a lot of still shots and eat or something came down and you could be looking at something like a Renekton put the grass in the jungle very strong ganking Duo there who could look who abused this gas well then you're getting locked in does make me think that hey maybe there's actually going up there to solo acting flat on your back when we have Instinct you are Marching In the bottom Lane but we will see what he ends up flying it's going to be probably also or this been aroundGangplank topping and Yasuo mid or bot I am going to guess that this is Apollo Stendra and Phoenix yato we'll see if it does become the cases Phoenix certainly I think the most experienced player out of that group but other is the ability you know that these players have to have been practicing these pick could be grinding on those pics especially with Rift Rivals Whitney needed yesterday so many bands harborage Wars yeah so a lot more respect than given to the pic at people really saw the effectiveness of it from a lot d d l e c teams are 590 brought it out before if Rivals DL as well use the average travel to great effect in it is going to be swapped there so as expected Phoenix will get the also and it will be the Tinder up off Galaxy brain is not coming Apollo on Sandra and Phoenix is Indy going to grab the Osco and as you mentioned Headhunter follow him around the problem is bell cost is not a good top laner No Escape long Lane slow movement that's going to make that hardleaving you know this is mid lane alone I think with him when the vel'koz gets locked in you may just be opting out of that throws drag do you know if this isn't relly made or something like that equal becoming more flexible but certainly not the case so I guess we will just have to spell pus forming bid against the office tomorrow and we are going to likely have Renekton vs. GP top when I can certainly am at the Kent bulle GPU very heavily for early on but we all know how strong he is as far as stealing it solo has turned into a very good game play performances to win frecklebox this year was a gangplank are they was against Eli did very well for this will meet what he picks them locked in not guaranteed it was pretty likely we are on Fox 2 and 7/8 mind for wind is Fort Lee in playoff position right now there's that big tie for first at 6 and then a two-game barrier for the next Squad 2 certainlyit's possible to make playoffs pill with 9 2 Play-Doh things teens can make that search yes it's really interesting you can see it's actually Fleet footwork on the Osco door and shield and exhaust so pretty defensive setup your early on to be able to kind of survive all this boat that the vel'koz can potentially for a while now you can block the vel'koz you with your rent while you cannot block the W you cannot Block B R I do actually think of the eu's blockable as well I'm not a hundred percent sure on that but that is how I actually remember that interaction that it doesn't count as it a little bit of a projectile and we'll also really going to have to come and see how comfortable does Apollo look on this end Resto + Nautilus does strike me as a lame where they're going to be trying to push you have quite a bit of a OE try to shove in and and kind of deny any potential pressure coming out from this Calista with that sort of strategy also at level six you having night you have it's such easy set up for this kind of the week you know if you would get any sort of Lockdown from the Nautilus that pretty much guaranteesLanders done and Auntie play right here we saw Phoenix Atlantic you onto the Raptors why does the camp Fontana walked over to the Lane so we can get the tornado a little bit sooner than normal but Frogadier Pokemon Sun to manaflow band timer as FBI and who he got to put the shields up a troll against that kind of watch the old nephew has put in the Autos in Apollo got to be very respectful here really like the start of the shield there from who he I think it was very intelligent instead of just starting key for a little bit of hope both members and you just are Auto attacking and level one you're going to heavily out math any simple dinner so they can grow back towards you in and you can see that is a strategy drop the W walk board before those Auto attacked him and try to put them down if we were all so far have been couple other else get the 4th also start that one cast of Basil game yesterday with similar thing and forward they gon Ice Cube's going to land and to go for an autorun not just yetdo I do with Carlos and who he going to earn 11 Gold Cross actor that Dad going to be able to stack that up a fairly easily at least in the early level II I'll give it more careful nice little jump away their from FBI to avoid that her from aqua and if you ever do get hit by one pair of Assisi the fall of is going to be there but you also have to remember it's pretty much a one way trip usually if you are looking for those Menthol in CSE pretty damn sure that you're going to be able to feel them off because if you fail are you are going to be in some trouble with that passes stacking up the Spears and you can potentially just died from the case your contract now playing in the bottom side of the map there doesn't seem to be any chance to take though is the crugs already gone so I want to look good answer for a dive here I think they are going to find damageairport already call is true all right that was this early dye-free 4 minutes or they get them both all their sum is well and they don't even lose a member that was very well handle there by the golden Guardians juggling this a grow back and forth if you are going to actually look to start it up and they do for a back road gear to FBI just bought back over onto who had the Aftershock and then just kind of costly resetting this contract flashing out they now wait for the cooldown to come back up Hit The Binding who he walked out after taking that first PowerShot in the are eventually able to get that final kill as apology fuse back in but no one left around for him to try to take down a huge point of strength and I'll keep mine Golden Garden I have teleport themselves was Apollo's back in the lane with a dark steel back to farming it'll be a long walk back for FBI bologna made that trip a long story people in farm most of that gold and I really did go to who he so he is going to have that early Frost Bank and he's feeling pretty good about that and you have it on these reports can be pretty effective actually know will allow him to stack up at frosting a lot faster gets Woodside still more quickly and new even work towards things like that pees a lot earlier on in the game which is going to give them a quite a bit about an hour and I generally feel like it it feels a lot better to get those skills on a sport like lots than it does if you have a content for a bra or something along those lines video super job very well as we put back in the mid lane frog and left again for as much as you can that you can see he's out of mana and getting pushed to his limits here is Phoenix is coming in pretty costly for snow manifold to be worried about it Beyond suicide exactly and then I think that's pretty key because this is not a Teleport vel'koz write this he's actually playing Glen doesn't answer to potentially you know the Szechuan East on the the knot later on if he starts with being so mean if it's just nonstop shoving him in the baking and stay around and use establishing a nice disadvantage as a result of these two ways ahead now we'll see how much of this problem can pick up but the longer foggy days are the harder it gets actually Buena maintained with this woman and there was crazy as well as even though contract with you would have to be pretty dangerous is level 5 blue Smite jungler threatening in a potential or abandon is Phoenix and know that it's a one do you want anyway if you chose up the case you can see both of us here on the bottom side they don't know exactly where I might young is so it's allowing following Jaco don't sit on this free stuff for a bit longer than perhaps they otherwise would be able to you can see FBI and who he were trying to shove it in with their long-range abilities but still having to be respectful the fact that sends money could be there because they're only ward in that box outside jungle you actually had expired thing they really have no vision in this area at all and that is make Place go safely and it's also wife on track is getting cold down we'll see now if the Guardians can kind of make them into any sort of engaged but at the very least contracts is protecting them to push it increases wave safe well played right there Golden Gardens are playing around bottom side and again this is what you expected me pick of draft like this they grabbed the early Calista they wanted a Lane Bowie and they got just that and a punch the bottom Lane Red Bluff has respond they know where this Camp was started and looking for Phoenix actually yeah not the red bus to the Midland gang so I can has a manifold hear Here Comes be tempted beyond the scoreboard now is well 320 really nice move out to take priority and just show up Vapor Phoenix and rightfully hold on to those summer I think it was no escaping that one was going to get down you're going to have to knock up there so much all of CC so it will get Dylan they should brothers Dragon for themselves as well golden Guardians out to a very strong early start never was swept out blast comes over Lanza site at least something is on the board freckled fox actually has my side I do believe I actually stayed around and help to finish that off your FBI I went back towards Elaine and then did you get punished for that now if I the tops I don't want their very loud house is the rest of the damage so low as to kill solo on the top Lane killed by a GP early on is going to feel so bad for Han sir this is a match of that it was just going to get tougher with time and solo going to be feeling so good about his position now in this won't be one
