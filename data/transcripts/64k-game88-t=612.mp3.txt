is a couple of samples back and forth a nearly had that to go start to be dignitas date almost had to whatever liquid the shock to me was I lost the counter logic gaming and we hope they can find a way to turn around here it's been back-to-back kind of poke composition losses for Golden Guardians you know ntl they did get a pretty Monumental advantage in the early game closure has been on these power farming in a dominant really junglers than Italy twice the Braves once but you know both those little league games were paired alongside things like Zoey and Chase and asriel and they have actually been good at closing out those games feels like they know how to play in the early game but they're not as confident in a playing out those competitions around objective 10 and not as sure how to close out the game so I'm going to use the app and going for and try to call it that up or if they will revert back to what actually got them the win their first game of the season against thing. Which was much more of a team fight Center composition know featuring Kai Sangrefrontliners so I'm going to be actually see where they take us very on the same now we're going to drop it off the table going to go to the first take on Ezreal instead he's gone you don't get that really fun combo but still getting a forest a high price pot later at fellios to the most obvious answer with Varys and Calista off the table this kind of rounds out the 80 or so no shocks in the pic so far I feel really is just see if bladder will just take me to Lee away from closer going to that have been his most highly prized jungler a volibear another really important grab here that has been getting a lot of attention and pick FANUC 10t Flex pop or jungle we have only seen it top I do believe but I really liked it as a jungle pick also have been playing at I've quite a bit out of the Jungle and don't feel very strong there too so it will be interesting to see where Blythewood takes up and if golden Guardians want to go back to that Natalie because it is availableand it would be taken themselves up for you know another pokedoll composition but TF is actually spoke with style more what they kind of got the win on in Game of her one which was there an echo game and it has been you know getting a lot of attention it so far in the LCS do we have any of that is also popular than the other regions and it does feel like people of people are still adjusting to this pic they are not always responding appropriately to the global pressure but it does have you know not always taking consideration when TF could be holding in and I will be there to see if you can kind of improve on that throughout the split well galio going to be answering Global pressure with some Global pressure for Theatre ultimate is either side lane themselves Cloud9 immediately start batting away the champion you thought might have been to steal away as in Italy is off the table the volunteer as you mention of licorice ison a damaged Focus Champion 2 games on Jace a game on GameFly with his second board game of the foot and last time we did say he actually gravity Gallia was alongside the Olaf but they had this whole kind of composition did that was focused on on helping out flavor in the jungle right midline Dad Gangplank in the Top Lane that was able to Alton help him if it is trundle you can do similar thing to always a pretty highly prized picked into things like the orne but the struggle is much more on the supported side compared to what we had seen blabber do. So this is going to be a bit of a different look here from Cloud 9 no tuning this is jungle trundle this would be toppling Volver very likely and there is a slight possibility of black sitting around but that is what I'm expecting in this feels much more all about then and then his teeth by damage because it is a composition that is actually quite lowon TPS where is Golden Guardians have any threat coming out here it feels mostly about the Affiliates and protecting him and they do have an incredible amount of Peel but yeah it is a composition that if it falls behind a little bit can be worrisome you know having enough damage actually get things done and golden Guardians are going for this proposition that can pop up anywhere you've met long-range engage from the orange and the ultimate can all get dropped to pick up anyone from Cloud 9 who's looking to fight in the jungle is looking to fight in the side lengths and this does feel like from Golden Gardens that is designed to scrap and to be Cloud 9 where they look to fight you because any team that was have a chance against Cloud 9 is going to have to be willing to take those bite you cannot sit back and seat objectives give up everything that I want to fight or they will run you over in a big thing I want to point out is that knocked her and has a really favorable matchup around the galio you turn the lights off and he can't get back to your teammates when TF says hey let's go killStelios and the light turn out from closer you don't get to let nisky show up you don't get to teleport down there from liquor ocean of Oliver he no longer has the hell it's just then and Vulcan hoping it's going to be enough in the fellas doesn't always have the tools to cut it out so I really like what Nocturne does right there I'm a little surprised that band didn't come out as a champion that we will see occasionally and end does have some favorable interactions when you see if y'all you a bit yeah it is a really good point you know I think it's a lot more pressure on those Cloud 9 solo laners to teleport instantly you have to make such quick decisions against Nocturne if you see the other Steve Hot Springs like you think you're about to engage if you see going to teleport coming from author he's got to be so fast and make sure you can get that off before the Nocturnals might come through that's also where is on Golden Guardians back to you quickly on that to not have telegraphed plays to Hidden that you're going to be looking for this so that cloud 9 hopefully for their sake can't respond appropriately because if you're not able to get that clean engage off and the galio comes in the trundlethere's an all these Champions are creating space for the event he is definitely a player and he is definitely on the Champions I can run over to invite you to get the right gun to the right situation he is the perfect champion in a in that spot when you're on sniper Nocturne or snipe him for melee range would like red gun here you know so that is kind of the fellows that will be another piece to add some extra body parts go to his money left on the table but they're pushing it and actually to make it a second thought I was just so smart with how they play out the early games they recognize they have way more power than this or Nocturne combo with a volibear and the trundle and I both these Champions effectively Auto attack reset to use the Valverdeyou have the Q R S T from the trundle that is not a match up that you're going to win to be to there as golden Guardians live got a completely give that up close and have to walk all the way across the master to leashless Red Bluff which obviously is doable but already you're delaying that level 6 you know has that Nocturne in this is something that cloud 9 is to really good at kind of doing into peeling a part of the wind conditions of their opponents and we talked and go up against EG yesterday we saw how how hello Barbara this week just TP back to Lane but it is Ghost Fern types of Damages going to force me to get a burn to teleport to the late early and it is a great release a Pokemon deck light off in that range vs. melee matchup galio in the early levels doesn't really have a lot to trade back with so very well play there by Demonte buthow heavily they shut him down played the Six delayed this geylang a nestling that they're going to want to try to do here with closer to delay the level six much as possible track him Post 6 and we're going to see licorice off them that early trading on the Bolivar this is a very advantageous match up for volibear into a torn and it becomes one of those those games were again whatever is going to have no pushing topside that is going to allow him to get aggressive but now find out here level 2 3 Camp easy sun liquor if she's moving fast but there's almost no way flash keep flashing at the wrong time is licorice got a way to give the old school. Let thumbs up fat gang should have been better yeah but I don't even think he had it you would look up after one on one of those minions dying so they needed for Absol bit more patience and now blabber going to try to make a pay on the bus side last follow easy stuff flashes lightcomes through bladder is on the show them how it's done had a very well done mom said before utilizing the pillar noted for thousand additional move block essentially there has been even holding onto the paper, not try to shoot inside son you didn't quite have the range but I'm playing that out very very well and already you're paying dividends from that early invade what was or wasn't level 3 for his gang or he would have got to kill then you're down a couple camps already work on that bottom side here it is once more bronston into the pillar Buffy I has got a kind of like water through a heat blocks with you where's the blacksmith in the top-flight licorice temporarily down XP the hits for I believe the minion died as he was next to the wave and light goes out okay foryeah very well done and it said the extended trade-in or has rate of front damage in a with with his birds and we were talking and brittle into these melee matchups especially you can have a really nice Republic of the trade but as the trade continues conqueror stacks for the Volver you get your second W out into your ear then kind of hitting into the Eastfield and so on and so forth from the orange statuswhere Volver will really start to win out so y'all just got to be careful that when he goes to his grades he had the ability to disengage afterwards and to make sure that is not going to be a really extended grade where licorice can get the best of it has been sick night is going to runHaymaker make it to pay for Golden Guardians man as Leverage The Bottom Lane liquor store to hear TV coming back in this is going to be quite the fight for Hui FBI's in danger but he's a look at it back as posted faith comes over at least for some Vision as well as punch comes in and that's going to be pretty solid good fight there gold on the bottom line is really nice from Golden Guardians just great presence of mind to know you can actually go for that fight you know you're the TV from your top cleaner you know Demonte has level six and can look to join up so they make a Punnett a pitbull a little bit of a roaming Mission getting some boards down and then feeling a little bit to save a little bit too confident get caught by that flat available there for who he is and is able to class of back in and just barely get enough damage with that ignite true damage plus the W true damage shooting with that Center belowYacht Club 9 will be able to trade back and grab a first dragon in this game is a little bit less Farm Centric on the junglers bladder getting a couple minutes later Dragon City often get Saint Olaf obviously gave not trying to prove a shape but obviously trundle a different Janet Roloff does different things include much left quickly but who yes he's never spoken of Kavita in the thing that really triggered it exactly that forever word 315 pop left for your screen they saw where the Brom was both them was walking across that as soon as they saw the meatly licorice with the quick TP because blabber is moving down but they don't quite have the damage here you know the horn comes through land to double knock up if his first down licorice you had a flash so he just gets absolutely lit up and with the F able to pop that ultimate there as well there was a chance we could be spicethis is great stuff my support set can sun and and you know intro to talk to their to get more profit so I think he's doing really well this is great stuff out of the Golden Garden bottom leg I think Demonte sport got canceled by Misty I think he popped the button with a call I can't show because it is he's going to hit me with this one but regardless this is now in early gold lead to Golden Guardian blabber is going to go ahead and get his own stunts the jungle they're going on at Redbox this is the first so far afield close game minute when every time but it is good to see other teams leveling up to the elephant s plug on a gameopposition is going to get really bad really quick here because there's such Reliance on his damaged and obsolete dominate in that bottom Lane. A lot of times over this past year but just the fact that you'll they are not ahead is a good thing for Golden Guardians and you're going to continue to look to keep that Global pressure off which I'm really is respecting right now and misky obviously was not in position to to match any sort of gang just yet so is Venom Hulk in just completely backed off the tour waited for the way it's come to the farm have the rod of Ages done for them onto waiting for the combined cost of money here is the Feast of protobelt or inhibitory Fitness key obviously going to try to follow ensure that four people are there to hit blabberquite sure what library was thinking you know maybe thought that this key would be able to get the alt out sooner and then that bite would look different but let's be honest the bottling for Golden Gardens was closer to that fight was already there you know TF has his Aldi and he was not in position to be interrupted by Nicki so that wasn't very poor fight to actually take from bladder and just being some of those mistakes.
