Viper G2 they have a lot of confidence Galaxy brain right there Nico is banned away from Wonder flat there's one else on the team calling for 14 which which side was draft early game over the LEC good early game setup for a Smithy out of the Jungle 14 what do the painted following early on a fix for them but wait to see what the first for the last bands going to be the end of the first pic but I feel like I'm almost every North American team for it aloud, what you perceive that but, he's never allowed so that's never really smile band Ford Taurus thing okay to take one that seems like the obvious choice br40 which lane is going to be so far without try the challenge because obviously off what was not the best player on G2 we learned that one yesterday maybe say maybe I don't know we haven't seen it yet but I know last year a lot of practicing until you actually play it so my default it puts him at his best off of just put them in the game right now maybe you need to realize that you will like wood going for sure I think this I would still take severe myself play barely stand up and away we haven't seen any other do you have a very unhappy but it is scale and getting Eduardo second band plays there at the rally off the table that's worse when you are playing at before they become position flights going to Tara can you plug a tank junglers you do need some kind of hyper carry or least drawn Lake infratel swear to support I really would you want to talk you know there's some kind of early on Instagram but we could sense if you think that was fake going down into the bottom line. You want to go way back to North American fans hopes to an income statement so keep your eyes on that one special I believe back in the day help them get into the jungle that was a very good one wasn't sure Route 42 plain a million assassin guessing's at top of this point as the overall match of the bed top with t f in the middle and I think you don't blame me because of what you need to become a centralized get some more useful so I'm the map if they want to unpack this Donuts in your early game we saw that it's Nico busted yesterday be very very powerful makes your queue is good. It's actually so toxic ultimate Seek and Destroy competition from juice to kind of crazy place like that stuff is not that strong with maybe I eat my words c l need a top or mid laner most likely top of impact and it's actually I don't know exactly what I want to talk a lot of smelly a fathom on that stage Lonnie but I just want to wait I don't know what you two are doing over here give me 8 more seconds and then tell me where it's going I think it's actually Savannah by the way that's my prediction so where is everything going on TV support jungle and then I think it's going to be a pretty invisible invisibility text and then falling heavily aggressive very limited not that great either free 6 in his own farm and imported a right at the very beginning so that's going to be but I feel like every single length but I'm guessing who's helping especially early on because Savannah has no right way to escape from this life it is a very easy for US 52 path of topside early intervention shut down one well I think I think it was your surprise than this one what's the weather in North Bergen help against the LEC the respective provenza right here as in the game and to get to know a price on this amazing wonderful be too drafty Holly standing by with brass for an interview because I am here with grabs grabs you said yesterday that you were disappointed to see this so natarica come out from C9 so you're seeing it again today what was the reaction I bought them but yeah I think you meant to spice a company have to give him a chance before so that's what was the inspiration behind this cop was this just a spur-of-the-moment so you can use that for something that you practice a bit. I think if I give me a quick percentage chance with any chances of taking this game I'm in the dark on 50 50 50 50 Lovett they see the hell is great so that's the draft yeah that's way better than so I like increasing odds I would certainly lose a lot of help and TripIt of Mana taking this stuff by himself. No problem was in the group Next that'll be fine for him CF very early bag of gold going to feel good I get my clothes for a few days early trading Jensen Hugo sotil Lane by Lane and try to figure out what this Jeep new Compass trying to accomplish. I think that's relatively easily with this Dona Champions that even in midlane as a melee champ has really good Wayne presents because of the way you can use his shadow to extend the range of a shuriken you can land a fair amount of hope so I think once this lane hit you with the human Q to set up with Lil and sort of guarantee this hurricane they can maybe try it out attrition but that's always be really hard against the Sonic R what was the score today for keeping my NCL does have to he was in the landfill minor you be both never going to make Headway here in this matchup take me. Without issues there and go looking to be earned it does feel like I'm looking at a very early lights don't come by here in this one maybe I won't be far behind either he's playing it pretty well toppling match up pretty equal right now to want to go to push it has to be some damage yeah not Trey is going to be difficult impact doesn't have a ton of health regen right now belong on the door and shield in the ocean and I'll midline or tea out of potions been good around by Jensen is the ward outboard going to find the key for the slow can he juked the queue it was the flash nicely done by caps no fly for the first Mickey out he ghosts they have to lose the flash been how was Wings in a really awkward position to Smith and just stick around here because there's no flash on cap for the 4th of caps bring towards that top side of the river knowing Yang cosas very likely on the top side of the map and you'll probably wait another minute or two before looking for a tournament I got to wait for up and down to the bottom Lane 24th PS4 the terratone Leif Wells with his best when he is a very good starting late night stand it if they trade back with a gherkin not going to want to damage and yeah this is going very well for Tea Leaf Lane sonidera not this time I walked by this Ward what are the benefits of the sudden the bottom line is that he doesn't rely on Amana so in terms of overall system HP why is doublelift and Corte De can try to build up their health. They will be lowering their Mana over the course of the longer they do stay at length before teleport first can BB will try and wheedle downstage pbar slowly burn through the man as well and then look for knowlen and they just a little bit of rice are you actually walk through like he was walking towards the bottom land after his office cuddle Circle then turned up in the jungle with a drink at work to you or he knows he's gone that way they think it out and I stream it. That's good damage at cor nothing to run out of Mana biscuit is it was already picked up by the wreck on a person just a safe and make you can just take that off and hop back in the drop-down this Ward and Smith evening for a fact they can look to fully reset this wave now is Laura man of ours doublelift and chords to us I hate sure can still put the Champions across that one cute so big hit their it's really rough 40 elderly on all three lanes from G to have pressuring you mention of it in the draft that one Jersey doesn't give him that percent max HP damage on it so he can work through the how far of impact does the Conqueror to do so stealing much further into the cycling one who's going to have a pretty sizable Advantage actually really interesting to see him bring out the Wonder is a player that we know love to prep crazy stuff for toppling you like to call him the seven wonders of the LEC he had seven super unique Champions prep for MSI we saw at the Pike I believe the main as well just wanna maybe one of those suits with always exciting to see what he tries to bring us to the one of the ghost bar goes away we get to see of Utah planes reset coming through Kindle jamming along for their for wonder which could be decent of Black Cleaver if nothing else I'm going to see Savannah to hard reset and go towards Catalyst that looks like either Bissell Matt probably not Rod of Ages of the great feeling that good so I can take up some lunch at the bottom Lane TP was not used by either bought land on their way back in TV through DirecTV support because you bring her with you and you instantly come back in Boston December on a slow pushing away from TL Taurus G2 But first you can see how helpful he feels playing up and not really afraid of getting harassed gold just about dead even there between doublelift and perks and now support the game where you look to see I think you do try to explode across the map yank those level 5 hearing level 6 caps has his Destiny as well so we can listen to roam around the map so once yank those pics over to that level six and gets that from itself what you should get after finishing the blue box take a look to make a plate or mid lane big item going to him for sweat spell books at the heliport now we got the upgraded sights do now for him as he gets closer to the actual upgrade coming through just $298 short so far nicer Democrats vs. Yankees around the wing and this could be a slow into the attempt to charm you can see it as well for between the bot Lane Flats so much damage what a wonderful day for the quite as well as at 5 p.m. right back out for me as well boards the back end of that deal just didn't have to sustain damage to go against you
