that won't go too much into that that potential match for that would be so spicy if it's TL vs TSM in playoffs with with some of the kind of trash talk back and forth between the old quad still able to reverse their Fortunes in this series if they can step up their play they can still take down flyquest and secure themselves a spot in the grand finals of Shield themselves pop to but the story of the series has been the teams that are mixing things up that are moving away from that team flight 585 hasn't been working as much I think I'm going to bed Kaitlyn their head back Hitler asked if it sent it I like this but I know the Alice has spent a lot of time over the State Farm El Fiesta I'm talking about hey you know Caitlin she's really big deal but the deer has been I think the champion of theso powerful has done much work on that champion at least asked if the only s t r a t carry left so to me it's not his first pic but of course he has valuable the Evelyn which TL finally leaves up is there something to look at here and TLC as well maybe we care more about callista something like the Caitlin Wright easier to play some the planes that do a party gauge and actually try to dive on the Ashen Punisher obviously the ashcan play with those lines if you can avoid that still has incredible amount of power utility I think it's while turtles best pick has been an absolute Smurf on the champion on this day for a long time very very rarely ever get caught on it even when they are playing it's heavy and it just build aggressively and never die so we'll see if that does continue for them this is the flex set I'm expecting it more likely to go to santorin but TL securing very likely have thrashedwhat's the thresh super standard bottom light very aggressive does have the potential to look for those two V2 kills I would be interested in flyquest want to go towards something like the Morgana but if they do that and TL go for the blind rise then TL control more advanced word power be able to try to secure a comfortable match up in that mid-length I all the rides over with his hair before and is the grass they want team fight engage question isn't there enough back light damage to back it up we know Justin can do incredible damage he's just not been on conventional team fight Champions almost at all in this series The One game he was on Oriana they want it so we'll see if he does that later on here I think it's incredibly High chances that doesn't plays auriana or cast Sandra in one of those style of Champions I would be really hyped for this for this long and it does get locked in so it is going to be up here for Santorum very exciting stuff to see how he can perform this is has been getting banned out non-stop the Evelyn can be incredibly powerful know Heather a relatively healthy clear your post 6 you do get that that passed them in this and it burst from my head is absolutely frightening you can absolute Shred the meat of Champions champions like the callista you have to be relatively short-range you can be putting yourself in range of that Evelyn to get assassinated and I'm just to be curious to see where else like what state does with their graph of the going to grab something that can dive alongside that Evelyn or they just going to have this is Evelyn kind of s as like a threat of her planking and taking people off and play the rest more standard because it was just the Evelyn alone with the set I don't know if they're going to have enough time to 10 still here to really run the backline consistently past threaten anyone and everyone sure I mean second try to go there you can try to go there but it's going to be enough is definitely question we've got for this game as LeBlanc and I thought there was a chance to sell it can be a think we've seen it occasionally though it seems very unlikely at this point Tom catch me to grab for safety the bottom side of her glands on a spring a right back out and you mentioned there is less safe Beyond ask there is on a Caitlin over the Tomcats clips that one no problem I just honestly it's because content you're committing to like such a passive defensive play style that there's no sort of follow-up that it has four and Evelyn and set diving forward the broth is not like this explosive support but at the very least you can jump forward throw your ultimate down give or ability to throw you know ccj and and and and try to help you with that potential. So I think it's more of a happy middle ground also can be fairly effective against that Calista jungle still has to be selected your 40 lb could go towards the heck room wouldn't be paired with the sheds they're not as all in on the dive but it doesn't open the door for something like a necalli if TL want to go that route I still think that we on it makes the most sense here you have to speed up for the heck room it's Absolute Comfort for Jensen it's securing some of that consistent damage in 5e V style of play. So that would be the pic I would go towards and if I were TL here it would be really interesting just leave them fairly low on consisted damage though but like I said that have the tankiest team so I'm not sure how much it matters in this does make Eva's job which is already hard that much harder because now you are single Target damage burst assassin here on the Evelyn and you died for it and you one shot that callista get revived that becomes extremely problematic you cannot just continue the fight is Evelyn you're really are kind of the staff here at 1 pick funny well Jensen of all Champs ever played more than 3 times a zillion is his highest rates across 13 games 85% this is going to be his make-or-break moment now again yes LCS playoffs are double elimination if they lose the series they play TSM who is going to the final possibility tlr not completely out if this happened to them but flyquest finally is allowed to play the Evelyn for power mobile see if we going to live Spain we'll see if we get a nice butt flyquest toys to cover the final from the upper bracket for the first time if they can do it here today and see if they could knock down to yell 321 it's going to be so interesting because the Oriana does have the ability to throw that ball over onto this Evelyn you have more access to word that back line now but at the same time on the other side if DL gets ahead if they're winning out in these skirmishes zillion + a zillion + Calista those are incredibly powerful combinations when you have the aura in front of you you have listed running around a thousand miles an hour you'll snowballing the game taking everyone down if she gets focused and burst out know that is easy to answer with Brazilian and that's why it becomes important to be able to land a damn it should be able to threaten multiple targets and that's where the shock wave comes in that's where you'll need to find more than one target they need to be able to Britain consist it damage rather than just the one. From and Evelyn because really can't do that too easily okay well we are live I'm going to see who could not going to land on the red team liquid on the blue when TL play conventional team fighting they want when they didn't they couldn't put it through Jensen on a tried-and-true Maids do not the typical scary looking to put a lot of rocks and tactical to be primary team fight damage output Calista tends to fall out bit licking how come tends to get a little bit the same there is some level of early game episode. Assistance but it is still a potential team fight for the first Thirty or so he's that could be an office like a fun to do a little late in the day they don't just leave her so if there is anything we had they will be out of War doing so I believe they snuck in and they want to invade right at 1:30 instead of punishing Red Bluff start I think they're actually expecting where you would start of it is leashless they are going to be here is split so we'll see if anything comes from the XP isn't the first Camp Trade It Back and Forth Ward they couldn't get enough attacks in and that means red getting cold and with the vision deficits like was can't take this fights of rocks it very slow as it got you for running across the map food and get little to himself with it and with orange 3-3 with Ash from Evelyn I think that is a really powerful at level one it is so tough to fight against Broncos at level one with a concussive blows there so if not I feel like Dave take a look at me more heavily to that but I get not wanting to be with your whole game at level one but that being said you committed kind of like halfway for this invade and it does this end up resulting in broxah getting into a couple of those little Raptors he gets his red Boston Health Barlow Trail and I guess they get Guardian off but that is skewed that is what feels like a mistake out of ignore toll to not be far enough back when those who's coming in but they didn't know what was going to cross their all late Tulane didn't have the breakpoint in mine it's not the level to power respect for evolution is Calista they didn't expect it but that's only you should always be doing when your parents are going to get level 2 with you can I can test it it could have been a scenario where they thought they can finish off the last minute and then get level 2 at the same time and if you fight it maybe they were feeling like that was the type of position they're in the end Sauders down for them for just the one over on TL do take a strong to be to match of the deal has and now that you have is for I'm really on the back foot and you can create the potential to to pick on him with a potential gain from proksa or something like that in this is maybe geekvape but in fact is that he attacked by sent for the got to play around the immune somehow get the knocked up for a crow not claimed yet every single time in fact I was first Blood you cannot take this site without Flash he dies in The Dive and that is gold to Team Liquid that's a disaster they really wanted to try to make it happen because it wasn't pushing wave charge you actually need to wait out this year in charge of that is the mistake here so you don't you don't take a crow until after he does his right that is what you're trying to do but because he punched him right as he comes through solo is being damaged during that Cece and it's what is not getting damaged during that CC so if you just simply walk up you put the charm on it with a W and then you threaten that attack he has to use during charge or he will just be Charmed up first right and then you have waited it out he doesn't have that you kill him after that CC expires and it's easy peasy Miss execute and as a result First Blood over to impact flash down on solo and that that disadvantaged you do matters a lot less because they killed Old going over I'm going to talk to my knee pretty close to hear conceive Team Liquid has a squad out of three to four hundred gold right now double cash credit equally across the board bot Lane early Advantage expected for the callista lane and there's going to be some Farm grab buy aspirin should still be a small deficit on the flight Westside -10 will be answered by about 7 is the wave goes down pretty good setup a big knot on a block in the shop but you can see how much damage is available. It's right there and not proxxon make sure the top-end looks safe with a controller to eat in fact is you can bring his Tepee a while ago so low now on Shield blocking but he is not going to live through this one gets us. Still going to drop and Team Liquid the more we killed her two nice punish their they know the Flash's down dies on the Dive Dive to the gag because he doesn't have Flash and because he died he didn't have a 6 as well and now no teleport the wave is going to be bouncing so much of his is lead is it going to be completely gone name that could have just been destroyed by flyquest because they lose their flash now impacted 6 office get the experiences and they go straight on ghost was pop gets right up on a solar solar with a nice buffer W there but it just doesn't matter the Orioles Matt had already landed you get knocked up off of that there's no way for him to fight his way out are you not supposed to go pretty good into tank the topside it may just not be enough here as you can see what the room is on the way but already done and some do for Sunfire cape and texted be comfortable for a while I have to feel like I will see if that moves on bed linens wedding farm back and forth we are actually not being the typical Evelynn build we actually on first recall Hugo dark sea lamp tell me if you don't finish this might till later because I'd like to schedule so hard of a PE ratios it's actually Alex got as well for your passive we had seen for decal deathcap first item pretty, as well I will see you this afternoon delight him first after the jungle enchantment but you're doing desk at first discover pass if you want to. Fall you like and we did see that the LCS that both games that they were on top of that there we'll see where are they touring does want to take us obviously jungle items completion is extremely efficient in a you are a little bit less powerful of course you know if you don't have that dark so early on, but he's just trying to raise the word that power Spike and we'll see if I can get anything done here because he is now 6 and this is where you really want to start making things happen that you can be ignoring that Vision just going to sneaking around trying to look for plays he is going for the invade beer they know the boxes down in the bottom side for the dragons so he can take away the cross and even the blue buff I think it's often up it back you could always look forward another dive but it is very very risky cuz if you feel that again it could be the surroundings have to wait it out goes for the three Charmed
