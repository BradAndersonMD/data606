both meanwhile a similar things for for its part you know what set up some of the changes in the hearing jumbled up for the play on saturday after they got there was an absolute dominating with the curator of that the peace talks really nicely into the into the net and larson started playing the calling the public and rescinded the super aggressive big so i didn't think i can river are going to have the repeats used to build coming back into the team get into their spots as mid jungle with the opponents that they are now facing meanwhile timing enough i haven't plane in other states for the seventeen or twenty six the verdict which to run down and read recently that they've been together for a long time and to me they were the best bottling in the peace yes blood on the seat school games of them not as you find came back in one of the jury that flight information regardless well with him in the lineup and the top includes those that were you present stop jungle bands know it's utmost our audience giamatti with the final battle these aren't so we're looking at great really heavily here then i knew what the jungle slipped up once again for beauty were not received it from what i'm going you more which they had solicitous within a few clients and it's probably gonna be a dirty kindred war graves of more than most likely and with this picture focus on them when they're very clearly trying to get inspired my mom and rules and with our borders and see if the fine and having him get revenge on the elysee they have a play and ron back in twenty seven deemed worthy of revive fanatic that bottle testified that they go to get on a row of so many years later out with new teammates in the new line and you can happen to flaunt larsen a player with a lot of eyes on for me it gonna be a rope when i looked all want doctrinal made adams barton larson and lucinda was the most of them champion against them the white house yes he was not sent them to be as he left that out and larson stoops that instantly the id there was a loose in it and then they immediately take that god and my son is dead been cast acquitted this does put more pressure on haiti jungle though when you meet the aunts lily of the handout you expect something like maybe the island comes through for inspired us to combine a little bit more effectively with the sole english and there's a great arthur balfour river no surprise there are one of his most successful i'm mostly champions in light come through here for this one is the most play that cop later all be in such love for a lot of aggression down there but war when you get into the tank that are a christian but now i'm not going out and you can't fly into it but we're busy now would come to light up a fighter match up like that but the bird in that battle of a risk and reward with the rope action was not yet begun to the kind of built what's around as well so far eyes on it there he is the very heavily indexing it to attack the image that are with jumbo and talk to me to eighty one to these early on in there that we didn't actually going to have to get that money before when there is the evelyn attractive that that's really really really cared what do you sit on the willy and italy dance for you but to go to their so now maybe i'll see the moon was supported double bottomley to go get a get their hands on for quite some of the islam the aggressive lanes your time like this before that i'm asking about greeted by the aggressively into an ensemble were he is you go with the words for even in the flying planes kill wings on one side of that i'd really like that look from rome and since they already showed the leaned to saline for themselves this is gonna be a key role that comes out a theory quickly looking to dominate siblings looking to try and snowball and so would eat the senate about rhino wide putting unified at that one hit my lot of utility carries for the jury and those lights on in june but all he played during the easiest white house yet was democracy and there were thousands dial the team to about one and so a lame duck into the fleet playback in to survive could work very well difficult but you generally to the team buying power all the nautilus the guy in most cases usually employees to win on land of that vineyard and okay bye bye bye think they're wrote me to end things this year was a surplus is your thing would be that you mean the peak periods for him and his performances could be so critical here on and as you can talk about so high with the actor one here on route to let you get to salute you for themselves meanwhile he as he trying to get the new man out of the software possibilities for it is the single out and a single rate is the point of exploitation yeah broke up when alone yeah exactly four out of four possibly four teams so that's why no tissue that really redacted pick the very clearly or calling out the other calling their shot they want cannot be allowed to be very very top side that's that's what he is laid out world's before it was you think it actually made it come to the totals see these teens i think building towards their strength to d. n. a major uncle are really really big deal here for rolled on gps he signed it hot flame is where you're looking right now we're not in the unenviable evolution of you bully especially when backed up by the outland analysis you worry are coming for we know a soul winners are there and really no way to flex henri top government and the note was for sure the question is what those toppling surfing the internet and i told the conclusion i did the mouth like yeah exactly what this effect warmer smacking tank in the talks like a deal with the difficulty in an exclusive to automobile i love this pleaded is that no he'd go ha been earlier like yes your column is out there like young really big rejected were pentagon top players didn't work colleague you out are you gonna drive by being treated like you know why are merlot stood here you've got a triple first make barber there would raise redacted was sent out the top side is full attack him it's mouth like to see them easy big fourth been in for the team competition that they are beating the compound that competes with the recon as well so wrote actually coming out of this one looking really really honestly or contemplate all this summer's what law schools to the jedi goldblatt out of reach out a little bit diapers vendors and plainly since it first leaked a report on ever came out yeah totally noted country well this point i'm like what's the impact of an old new worthy of you again we found may be rediscovered lot of support and that i'm not about the other hand on your side right very good reason for online still expecting senate to be performing a champion down if you find out the past is not as a possibility and will see how these teams can help while thomas them to negotiate and wrote i think expectations are on that they can turn round for the elysee guidelines that ross perot to ring plane you can't help but feel so that we want your shoulders think okay look metlife global we will take out where they left off so we were world b. take this one down they want the elysee summers what what stephen they bridged and that's the one thing you're up against used the talent in most of those players first time in actually actually but things yeah did you see down here they made the waves the planes with their substitute players and so everybody is looking at taking root for coming back into the team that you needed to that group states you're returning to this was in the need to prove that they know that i think the main and lighting battle down here i was willing to stake out how well these two teams it why it on allies were unfair and has a leak in the exploited to be a problem but he's no legal right to our must not no not quite analogous and to grow for spouting all of a town here top jungle and made it pretty much all got their elysee debuts on roads dig a talent scout and they put them in deadly larson play to get educated that although the count that team believe it's like this is world flooding in their rosner gathered from the fall asleep from all through the thing bill or a runner bring you back again with poison elysee day one of the elysee regular season they were the very first seen qualified for worlds because of our elysees form outwards and now they're gonna play their first game rose one eighth wanting to mount a widely regarded as it can i do like outdated their licks in playoffs states that the losses and they learn from him like weird talk about it and use those strategies to their own benefits and we're seeing them once again they got illusion that so it's you look at the word larson and inspired the players i want to watch a lot of the lion king and we've seen so much only game domination we've seen one team he clearly an the dollar we saw copies words braunschweig was to some exact same thing as universal love lost the rats and i wanna see it inspired and larson can put on that same performance here in a new order come back in season one large to the second best that and elysee behind tax and cats is what gets hot formidable world top ten player of the world or it wasn't enough lot right behind you mean you don't like the elysee for like you have two years like this is an impressive start to lose to rear its down from up on the world's things that we are the game but pretty soon we're not disagreeable bath and mike but i wanna see how well the rest of it can work on sama what is the great player we saw him back on the misfits ron hall while back he was really good down there if they get sick as katydid five rue eventually get it all with low profile that you're an end and are back at him as well i think that the been around for so very long and now it's the back of the fact that i like a dent on everybody there by god everybody gets their momentum and now we're on this ominous read the best keith allen belt they deserve their golden did i wanna talk about oddity in the top side this guy is always a theory top player this is what i want to see him on tom you know you made it came with ya so we're back in the day when here was on her brain and didn't come they do have the difficulties of going totally the top and jungle into the mouth i'd like and can still all focus on that side spying on it and brian work off of that strong side over the gates take control but five guys up some of those options hitler it there you can forget during you recall which now for sleepers and parsing sleeper top side for them to find all the to more but that's the thing i'm never been a gang you don't need to put your own words down because it's just you close with doctor down there but it does mean that they cannot get his own vision he's just going to be in the wings and mercies of on again river and if they ever do on again come down the hill blades for calista very much whirling focus filippo reluctant it would be you people don't know what to do this super super on can't work it out of the flush out instantly what what that white house has not yet a beginning and the only thing has made me your manner that is a career out of all road but the level one planning here because awake decently in the side pricier than his work items that you get them after the blast knocked up secured for and that is here that means that the values of our don't want that you know why we get for that first live little bit second page three headhunters is to have a right back up of course no harm you recall for the life so you know it is manipulating fact that power in office hits to their power of the esteem in the back of the reef no flash on are gone but the lovely front of it that was on the way you got back on earth and cannot let's throw it's like going to earth can throw it off right now without race is doing her or giving up the top five years old was but then theories of affiliation is that both of them about what to now one of us get paid for inspiring you want a full week where i couldn't fly think if you wanna spend time aforethought psyche you don't even look at the end until these levels to steal his duty there on the mouth like bees to lead the way it was mostly does not get into that please stay i just keep up his death it's protected don't take the freeze the trades versus them make use of your passes you wait for to come back up before you go over those riskier see as this time get the last six that you're looking for here too 'cause he'll blow the on that now fighting with three levels that opens on all of the play making for road to occur on the part of the new thing you've got yes no flies on work on let's have 'em is actually one of the well to live with the divers who are you going to have nothing to flies you hold on to the rank and he i hope he can it lead the god i thought my band their life not hunt was the the whole and pipe on clay and croats whites for meddling gates the bottom line begin away more than either jungle argument again and it feels good for inspired the two won't do it all clear on evelyn is having his bottom line to walk again for himself korea's all of this gives good just alike says bottoms go grab right there and look into the future do you guys yes this is fine sama ae bigger difference in multiple games for smuggling burning things last question him again without life for bottom i think it is yes but what they actually settled on bottom line and what is one of the u. s. jugglers to go be with these things because you can pull the trigger but when i walk up into the lead know how work on to jump to you as soon as the archives of the surgeon wing who worked on the mark on just what you want to a three who are covered by invisible to get the nod to don pablo and then you get a full sees the direction it's unfair of a phone if it gave would like to get that sees you walk down when they get flock to it even a semi taking to the vikings were not always been good i've listened to zero with that sense of when the phone with the invisibility provided to jump for work on an issue like he's your poll be coming through right now nine hundred boldly to rob is not the most money on arson because you are flying of this multiple ways though to biblical put on his sleeve or they can get anything he has almost no one asked that you like those of us see lots of whit of that
