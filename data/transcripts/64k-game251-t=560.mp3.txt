It's super scary when is a head right because you can reset the oil it not Reviving if you don't get the kill can sometimes me and you'll for junglers I do like to focus a track Lanes if they get behind early you can try and keep them behind and make it that way for the majority of the game so quick thinks of when I hear I know those bought the bottom and slightly cut off that is as real and Stage 1-e Band Away by C9 and Fibber and play stuff and Away by flyquest though stop robot Landmark seminar band and diet is grab right off the top gear as well to the lock that and even though when you work on his band earlier on it's going to be another late-game scaling Bieber recently booked as well help this dying for a wild turtle died in the last half-year even without the possibility of the rakan combination filled with so much power in the champion you got to mention a little bit earlier build very very easily into these print build and has a lot of Stacy from some of these dive tools with the ultimate hecarim also being locked in here very very powerful force been scaring that is going to be him on the warrior Trinity forest hecarim was a critical part of the C 9 strategy in Spring contact that guy that we expect I do want a slightly consider a truck still flexible Zekrom yeah I don't think it's going to happen to get paid. Top tech room jungle most likely but we have seen those Champs played in those other respect roast and now 500 that I made her debut here and there and then finally I think solidly in The Meta really a champion that's really good at diving verus by with a point-and-click with these low Mobility carries a good try and get that back line kill the Target by it's also quite good at snowballing Isabella Lane so vile irelia or Vive plus rised a very easy to execute kill combinations playing off the other ones crowd control absolutely tasty or get the Killer is the 241 up Top Lane could work very very well peppermints and the jongleur there in silence for this gives me to pick as well as I do want to take a tonight because this is been something has been taking over solo queue in very high rated game is the ignite headphones now undertaking ghost or Flash for that early first really game for oriented Summoner spell do so maybe not applicable to Pro play the look I'm getting right now in my chance that he moved over the ghost sadly not ignite but I think it'd be pretty hard to see as well there's always a chance and now that we are loading screen it is going to be closed tech room sadly out here otherwise nothing too out of the ordinary here in champ select DP on both mid laners 4759 doing two teams that have a good cry make Metro world number three and four teams in the last flick first game of summer we have a little bit of preparation your wild turtle on the diarrhea also taking clams in addition to the safety of the ultimate spacing of Galileo Lane quite a lot of possibilities here for use cases on that Summers bail if I have that read to you Auto W Auto all the things very easily trigger on Azazel Dahlia or even trades with the various if it got a Playa grow a lot of gold alright chant from both sides hike up in the crowd Cloud 9 fans very very sad of getting reverse sweat in Spring and flyquest we're so close moving further up in playoffs as well I'm at the correct that I am sorry that is a bug on the graphics of play right here on my screen it is lethal Tempo on this is it is not a love like the nephron that is a conqueror self soon enough but different please don't do what you're seeing on the screen right here if my expected refuse to believe to be believed this game and as we get ourselves out on this one let's see what these players have in store for us little ones have not been too aggressive nothing to outstanding happening right here is right for the jungle to start looks like buys going to be on the blue and a bottom side start for spent staring as well and remember now that we are on the new patches with the later Scuttle song lyrics are going with much more fuel level three beers do we do expect them to be forming up quite a bit more rather than going are those super early ganks Vian hecarim try to get a couple levels here so yeah they both just clearing out there besides and pulls from both Autumn Lane and they both get there a little bit late and Only One Mini Mystery air on the side of turtles and leave us episode one is doing be very easy tasty single-target camps out first The W very good for that though we going to get through this year I do like to pay attention to how the enemy teams are trying to track Gold junglers Anything. Both of the option of either rotating back down to the crugs or going over to blue side to start on the Wolves of likewise not completely sure if it's going to have a job to go over to the blue side going to finish up get that man origin of generation it done first and santorin does a full blue size clear device that you start machete it's much easier to do the camps that have left markers in them to go pick up the Red Bluff and we might see some movement here that's still a long time away so maybe even want to fight each other just yet just out of the trunk right there and now the sacrum is there to fight Center on push off and we'll lose a couple of small Raptor that's why I think that one but it's pretty risky here cuz you could be the reason to Thorne goes back in full Beltre has more Health in the mid lane but nisky had shoved a wave Inn and also was rotating over to the side so go snugglers kind of pull off of that fights in curing was not chased out there it's just you still had enough in the tank to the threatened following that roam you got to go crab it's fine just about 20 seconds ago and I was going to go to Spanish no problem at all and now we do have ourselves the other top total being taken everything from you as well as fence for infant have no meeting at 1 so it will be a trade but I'm pretty means one thing but the other side of that means another these numbers on a fairly similar Farm count would be quick at the top when it's + 4/4 y Pesca start for him mottling play the advantage for sneaky in laying alongside please a pretty good spot for the wave your on topside for licorice to is holding it right in front of the Tower so we might see some junglers called over to help push this up Viper work for himself does feel a little bit risky heck Roma is definitely a depth at coming through four leg aches because he talks can set him up with a small knock ups but it looks like we're going to have 10 tornados by hovering around too far away and you could delay enough to live able to use that to jump right back out of this infernal chains and no harm there either the Topps go to helping and yeah he was okay and not get tonight too much when you finally get that recall off double longsword in for Viper and the other pieces of the p.m. at One allowed so what helps us as well as we can say recalls off in the jungle has red spots for both books all right so currently then the telephone Advantage is still held by liquor if she's not gone back to purchase female Viper with the extra-long stores in inventories going to have that combat potency that I have to watch out a little bit on the side there meanwhile book junglers with the challenging Smite I do expect some early combat hear from from both of those guys they do get very very powerful level 6 All In all right though we are just waiting there was a chance of the early aggressive so far haven't seen it just yet you seen by her play free safety saw both busy and his W-4 there not many of the top five. Could we go out from JJ's Brown Deer as well and doubt taking down the old as he goes for the dive remember licorice had not purchased it was on the level 1 items are on all power comes from the flag Quest support as JJ was headed towards the bedside so sometimes you need a hold back a little bit this game though fireworks already fireworks Indiana to get back in the land do want to point out that of course be top link skills weren't for the fact 404 first why but if you mention TC Advantage I believe we're going to burn it just now shove in part of a wave so that hundred gold cost for losing that fight really on me taking off my pole vaulter I wish they had a little bit earlier licorice get some Revenge with a ROM down that was nice of a tipi difference status what happened are wronged in the mid top season 2 fight Viper will avenge do well through this pain inside edition 49ers disconcerts gain when on a dual rub into the enemy's jungle three-week want that topside fight again yeah I mean you talk about a little bit earlier but I hate rocks not going to be able to have your bubble 5 or earlier one going for on Aurelia this is what prompted the initial dive that got us all hyped up before ashes for it actually think level 6 on that three play number two on trying to walk back to Lane at little bit greedy on that inside or out hit on smoking the wall they're allowed it he's he's done for Viper being up against the wall already using the dash method no way Liquors could Dodge that's done and it allowed by perks to go for the all-in now
