considering this metal shake-up I think that damn one is is going to be a team that actually works better with this kind of War Vault you know when you look at guys like shomaker like now you're either going to be able to play a lot more of these flexfix Flex has never been a strength of TL they play their style and they hope that that works where I know we can certainly see things along wine the Renekton dilution the Tristana getting flexed around that is going to give draft advantages to damn one who's already sitting on blue side that kind of time outside sitting below 500 you know would actually splitting game with black swirls from the LMS how then when they did go back to that phone style really get that self-belief and you know behind what it'd be able to win out on the best advice I think that they should learn from thatas an individual have one of these made fix in a double of had been playing things like they are on his stream it still changes the way that your team has to play around you and Team Liquid is such a team that is built around team fighting 5e 5 protect double if that is how they win their championships that is how they had to accept that I must die and I do think going to amaze if I would be a pretty big step away from that recipe for success in Europe ban themselves know he might want to see liquids for comps has been playing Sona Tom kench or sewn at Erica's that sort of Avenue is still there instalok gragas oap General Grabber down here because he also is such a powerful take away now you know it's something that is really comfortable playing very likely could be looking towards you like Riga Taco combo incredibly powerful and such easy set up when you hit level sixgo down to the bottom of the barrel and nuclear stability in that calm it's also one of the few complications if you get it together and get it rolling in a team $0.05 I think it had the weaknesses of what may be nuclear and Barrel a feeling in this head-to-head matchup locked in here for them as well as possible and also very likely this is going to be not Gary's bladimir this is one of his key pixie like the playing Cuttery greedy Ariana going for things like Paul Litecoin she almost always takes klepto in lieu of things to do like that phase rush and he's such an incredibly strong leading player they can create these Monumental advantages but you can seebuilding for v u v this is very few opposed strategies here when you have a guy stuff alongside the galley OJ for you looking for v u v you're looking to set up around this Paisa I will come to see if they want to remove the supports and arguably top laners bastide liquid need to fill his composition as damn one themselves don't have a bottle in just yet unless that Flex comes through Lisa support for that's flexible there as well so well not pulling it Team Liquid pick and ban Vladimir in the small plane that's why I'm so surprised that they went to something like the job and obviously respecting the depth of compact champion pool right now but I think that this is a little bit of are you if you don't get to pick their in the top line has shown so successfully how willing he is to just you know let this plane has been popularI'm no we are I wouldn't I be expecting it to be support here for corejj but it is possible that could be going mid-length can do for Jensen or even theoretically up to that Top Lane so we have to keep that in mind but no corrige a day certainly what's playing the gal you actually pretty heavily back at MSI or List It was one of their go to pick 10 strategies alongside the Chrysler change it to Delia however threw let him for a solo Lando the reduction of that you just have such a good boy in the priority and I would like to take him if he just so far they have a really good. I've made. Bottom bunk you know if you're able to guarantee that priority and get that job you can really play. Electrons split Batman versus notary that's what Luke is a very successful and a victory and if you can't handle that and still flat oats to Big sort of support pick up Matt is gone a lot of course like me to be in the top teeth coming instop playing out like a truck that has been gutted in terms of early gain weight but it is so much harder to check out that late or something I have been seeing a fair bit in Solo Que te pegar El especialito parrot alongside something like the Alistar setup still incredibly well for the cage you can go in with that engage and is going to be galio support here as I bought you this is something that they're going to be very careful about on that bottom side because if you change the combo from Alex are into a cage that does up so incredibly easy for someone like brackets to come down the only real way to escape that is having your flash up their team liquid is going to play very caught with Leon that bottom Lane for risk getting hundreds of 0 between the ignite in the ultimate and that makes the Distortion from the LeBlanc going to beincredibly risky late James Viking tool as well because you could get for that I think there are actually a ton of fools right now the damn want to wind up by B-52 are we expected them to go to 131 not necessarily with such a good collapsed I think the sword father drop is heavily favoring the L DK lineup Stephen exciting draft right here is your right the vigorous the bottom Lane well past the time you can stop right there really hoping that this is a player if you haven't been watching since it's time to watch him now he's going to be a huge Force for this Watts the right now so he's my pleasure to watch right here but Team Liquidend of the first game of World for the North American Champions Team Liquid feed here if he cheated earlier pick up something I got a highlight right off the bat it's the call start year for another you're going to see if the klepto this is called this is very much his place out something that he's really well known for and it's so dangerous when you are playing against someone like this was going to be so talented individually and on the Vladimir skills incredibly well and if you didn't check it out for us did a really great breakdown of time specifically the field he goes to what is a guy that has been playing letting me the whole year and is revelot revolutionize multiple build he started with the door and drinks. Then he went to was it CC Dr Adam this time you're probably going to seem also go for an early Nomad Medallion being ever build up that's cheap and efficient CD out and then go generation items be able to flush a Medicaid and it becomes are really difficultproposition for your opponent right it if you are at Smithy do you dedicate your early game time is trying to keep down this Vladimir that is somewhat of a ticking time-bomb you may hold him down for a bit when that cut their goals is coming in to call flashes that cashes out you really are going to be ramped up in that big and pretty quickly and help other parts of the map that was an area of impact game I felt like. Much better for Tame like what he was constantly running out of that Top Line so I think that this might not necessarily Len to that place all I would like to see them go bowling on the bottom part bottom Lane is the fact that he was spotted while it is jungle route because you saw impact come to Lane a little bit late with damage on him he leased the red dolphin encounter surmised. Jarvis start a while to my knowledge but you do expect a week for the gragas so he's in a little bit more fog of War goinghe was actually spotted on toward their butt is there a really sloppy walked over where there's no reason that show maker should have been able to actually know play to the other side of the map you even called it out for you cuz they knew that he was very likely starting on that top side given that impact showed up late to Lane so perhaps a little bit of a Jitters there in the early game from shomaker very aggressively not having the teleport to get back as well that's going to cost him to experience and when you're playing against the LeBlanc experience becomes a very crucial because it all in at that level 6 months especially if she hits the best can become very impressive in the lions always expect can you tune a visit is going to try and even at that cat could also take a look at the buys right it's just a refillable know when you're looking over on the other side getting that dark seal on the 1st by is going to be very preferential here for Jensen so in these coming minutes how you certainly going to be sitting pretty but you're expecting that all then much on the way out has any kids up from first damage if you are able to land abilities and that is going to require a very good Brock control so I'm interested to see how they maintain this book and what do they can continue to replicate that in the link that I feel like it's going to be necessary I definitely agree it is incredibly important in awhile you can kind of play more aggressively I feel in these early levels against Veigar as you start stacking up that passeth as you start getting these Vibes and especially when you hit Level 6 the birth essential alongside Alistar combo with Ignite really does friend the hundred to zero type of place OTL is going to try to have to create event adjust in these early levels and in trying to get something done before down one can get there when we should look to open up this map is through a lot of what is already going well for the midline push is going to pay that bottom line push that opens up the blue side bottom jungle experience what is going to sit and if you open that up for Smitty it's only going to make good thing so I think this is one of those explosives and if you take a look very easily see where Dom Juan is playing to look here on the mini map for deep words in that TL topside jungle this is why we are thinking and fax it back under Torrid willing to give up farm he knows he is playing weeks out of the map and see if you step up if you're trying to trade with his Vladimir despite the fact that Vladimir's week in the early levels Caton could very easily be behind him so this is intelligent play from impacting despite the fact that he's down for him he has to play it out this way and the first time it's missing shows on the east side of the map he actually he's able to show up back to I like impact time and once again so many promising performances recently definitely Incredibles player has been one of the best top rated North America for a while but a while people have told him to number 1 to be fair to your point I think that's clear but he's definitely been a good player on the world stage when it matters most and you can see that trade get some pretty close and far 5ps difference. Too bad maybe a repeat like me to hold the button actually just been getting better in general you know if you think back to the performance is licorice was also able to have it was a role that was up in heavily criticized going International Tournament but I feel like it has started to be remedied yeah definitely agree you do mostly on the back so if I think impact as well as liquor she's got to have been really fixed and out for the team and certainly no excited to see how they will be able to perform against Tom competition here but us far pretty slow early game it is going to be infertile first dragon so if either one of these teams are going to be looking to make a move toward that but that's where it feels like The Unwanted to tracking a Smithy everywhere he goes they have had such good Vision it had so many paying for it down across the map you know you can still see their is 1 of a cup in his jungle over here no there's another pink or down in the bottom side he spotted out starting at this Dragon so it's missing is really kind of been stifled really good Ward from them on again for the breakers Predator X out but the rest of the squad when can they come down you got the Block in first before mother is there without Shoemaker showing up it isn't fertile trait going to Team Liquid very early on 7 Minutes in a really nice timing on The Inferno dragon as well that means you no one will waive pushed out the liquid candy into a Rachel and Top Lane flip is what we call it the second objective and liquid very much in control of the pace of this early game yeah they certainly are in a lot of it is just off of that furly game gang from around and show maker at 6 I don't do not come you got to jump on your body as well not going to go for the flash play so far okay now what is that trait of ultimates you can see better actually going away from a CDR Bill though he is likely going straight towards full apk here looking more for kind of that one round style of Vladimir when you do go for spellbinders orbund
