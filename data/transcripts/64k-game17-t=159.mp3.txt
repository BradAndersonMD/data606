on the LPS stage let's go and end I am I'm excited to see how these players grow over time and and could reinvent himself because he had the LCS title right he had that MSI finals downhill for a while from him and and he was part of the sealed you something down and down and down and getting more disappointing and now he gets to reinvent they look up of the roster were all going to show up we're all going to rise up and then get good again I mean he start can really do something great for you right you know if you've been kind of stuck in a ride at Six a has been with seals me for quite a long time even just a changing environment I really can do you good right you know maybe he can't have that Resurgence he is obviously the it's kind of like a clone veteran Force here on this team and as far as the LCSC concerned and we'll see if he can impart some wisdom on younger players if they canreally start to improve throughout the course of the split because to me that is a benchmark vs stats for Golden Guardians is getting better throughout the split seeing improvement from these young players because of golden Guardian can find you one or two young players that are from an essay that they can build around for the future. Hey baby New Year to you import players around them and all the sudden you're pushing for a championship yeah we'll see what happens if maybe it turns out that you don't know how is the next Licorice and iconic is the next blabbering we're going to keep dating C9 players and he's fix a one plcs in his first replaced and still want to fly to like these players I want to see that we have seen players pop off instantly I want to go back and let's think about world how many times is there a first-year like you've got all the guys who like showed up for semifinals the what year did when it's like the next like that you can pop off early on but let's focus on things are going to win WorldWorld Sierra from Collegiate world champions league world champions it's it's basically the same level of play Thalia locked in for iconic played good yesterday gets to play another high impact II Farm high damage has made based on the world record for most good top laners arcare EAD Champions I protected and Camille going to see that speak against the stamp was tragic I think we'll pay trash on Cane but going to go ahead and just give him a hug and Italy and he'll pick something else soon I do like it is at throwing that out there as you said you know these two Champions combined very well with lot of the meta top laners in a reactant is already banned out so they go to Camille I would love to see who needs a lot of Jack's here I think the Jackson Italy can fight very effectively against Camille as well as to Leah at the 1D wind is favorable to Jack's you out scale the Camille in that side lengths it is obviously has lots of like a reliable engaged that's really the only big advantagewhat kind of has a in their nara's what Tony played yesterday and did not have a good time on it and this is perhaps the safer option but a lot of people feel that Camille can actually win this one if you want it you can get all A's on the Nar in Minion are other is the potential to actually punish this pic that means that if you are not playing aggressively in that top line or if you were put on the back foot these bayley versus rangemasters become incredibly difficult very very quickly if you're under your turret getting poked away at by the Gnar and losing current place you can fall behind in a hurry so I will see how iconic in Niles can really going to pair up to try to punish you need to be is it feel like a super hard counter over all I know he played it yesterday as well as to what he went right post it as very very slightly in our favorite but like under 1% and hey you can take your greatest out with that data Pro play that was different but you know it's not like you're taking Silas into malphite where it's just the most free Mac of all timedial to me I think his most iconic Champion is Camille here like this is one that I seen it really pop on he plays a lot of so that's exciting office in Golden Garden to take your legality of me and they're clearly going for that that hard and Gates I'll leave them there of the Galaxy to get him there is another very aggressive composition with global pressure we saw the authority band display the galley oh yeah you can you can play that midlane you can also Play That's before I think that is also completely fine with missing a fair bit of galio support and some of the other Pro regions a couple of those marks and bands coming over to Ward's fix a he did play the caixa yesterday which is already been down so caixa MF to Mira all taken off the table Jin already grabbed out there for a loss so I really putting out a lot of priority on getting what should be a winning bought lay here for TSM people very excited about sword are coming over here seeing what he can do Fresh Off The World Championship Finals is this player and we'll see what he'swill be going for as his back because it is going to the last pick 4 Sword Art so does feel like yes you can use your lactic support to try to round a proposition for generally when you do that you want to try to pick for the winning to be too and I think that in combination with the fact that I already have multiple marker Advance feels like they're going to try to go for a winning to be too and try to bully Newby and 6 a looking for it take to get to go back to the other is a support I think it works quite well for the gate to let me know you can move your midline to something else I thought you might just like Delia based on just I look like he had before and serafine's also an option I think she's a good men and supports that still leaves the question in the air now I got to go for it I was right after allSuperstore. We'll see if it does mean a lot of damage and little pressure across the squad is going to have a lot easier time linking up with a Camille especially in the earlier stages the game that it support Gallia what that's larger why they're guaranteed and gave Galileo ultimate on top of the Camille ultimate you're locked in the hextech ultimatum does a very powerful in the side lane if uni is is exhausted if you make an ARG you're stuck in that may need our form you can all in on that for sure to Leah's ultimate behind you get Ulta din by kambi old galio comes in on top you are very Squishy in that mini in our form and you can get a first down so we'll see how well they can play around it the power of evil can, try to keep Ablaze all of locked in his laying a speaker can be around behind him he's trying to protect him from those sorts of all in because it does feel like they're going to be playing heavily through that and the last pick out there hear this that's feels more like it's for the team flight and just having kind of some guaranteed ball delivery here and engaged I rather than for the lane because I dohow to write she was playing it on the turnaround who is on point field layout a lot of those Alice are engaged in the 2 V 2 of course there is a potential for Q Flash in these sorts of shenanigans but it's not the most reliable as far as what I thought they were going to do you know going for a wedding to be to which maybe you would have gone to work like a Morgana or something like that try to answer threshing wind Lane devices really accurate is the head but when Camille dies on it with Jen or someone or Ian it's like okay if you had but the Camille out that breaks the ultimatum right nothing else to do with you and the actual spell itself if you kick her out then it ends and that's how you can let your teammates 5 to safety or find some way to get away from galio overall that's me and was like what it's about and we are on for this one golden Guardians started off LCS walk in with a win over counter logic gaming actually just CLG their official name TSM also by the way not team selected or just TSM they are on the right side a long timebut that's one of the very strongest teams in North America you can give him a small pass as it is early on for the roster Lords of the top Golden Gardens going to spot themselves on a wart and there's always going to get softer stuff for anything but I believe who near actually most likely be speaker who dropped the one that came back for a sweeper early defense of vision there and because they spotted them out we can see that lost sexy invading to get award down of his own very defensive start early Lane Ward and bought Lansing if they were so I don't know if this is just kind of scouting out what Golden Gardens has been doing in scrims or something like that but it felt like he s m was very much expecting the potential level 1 invade here of course to Leah has a very powerful level 1 know maybe something to do with just the Champions that they had picked but she isn't ready for it they do spot it out and stopped that so we'll see where they want to take us from here as a loss is going to be starting Lane doesn't have to leash because because starting up on that tablesite on the Redbox and it is going to give them the early push year and the earlier level two very likely as well in midline is the fact that the blaze Olive share that wore gold XP across four players I believe a four-way Cher still enough resoling to get level 2 off the first wave is that might give him a little bit of pressure does not give you enough so it's kind of important I was once a day or someone else could have hidden away regardless though stop playing early push going in that grass can be tough for Camille into range Champions or is that for 80% of the game so you know it look you're going to burn your hook shot just has harassed you're not going to get much out of the Keystone yeah I mean I think we thought was it would have been at world will be something like that the Omni Stone ignite teepee style your try to answer again somebody's range matchForest Isle of course this may just be a comfort thing in or not not being used to that but generally you don't see grasp as much against the range matchups and people used to do, that is less common now but I do see more things like PTA often times I or even conquer against these has the matchups because often ends up being more about the all-in then kind of the back and forth poke our grass is going to be most effective new stacking up the bonus HP from that and just being able to get these small trades topside we no speak of the other side of the map so theoretically a chance for a dive as icon is going to take down Scuttle crab and does be fairly standard Tulia clear which is Skip wolves do everything else start bottom go to top that's going to work pretty well but ultimately just going to end up grabbing balls afterwards and doesn't go for any kind of place topside and you can see that TSM was actually paying right on that scoreworkout as iconic was doing it so I having a very good idea of where he would be home with them to be in it's always really nice when you have a jungler who is very confident of tracking this or or perhaps it was someone else doing it but no largely it is the jungler calling out where they expecting to be based on the timing based on knowing the speed of clear for those Champions at having accurate tracking going to make it a lot more safe for honey but nice for now is because you did get the fully pushing and reset the wave and he's going to be able to recall without actually having to expend the teleport so grabbing a second or inside of a year plus refillable has the door and shield now plus the blade I will be able to withstand a lot of this kind of range harass that could come through here from uni and we'll see if he's going to be able to get control in this Lane Health minion are has I think the little lowest base Health in the game at least by high levels he's eventually got less than you me you know that feeling kicks off butcost of metal a bit because the flat 3 health for trigger is at Point back at 5 minutes we know that the first dragon spawning in a second we still got three minutes to go until everything else comes up and I just like little but okay I think it back wall into the roof then out of the route they do that pulverize knocking them up in the air so pretty much maximizing the CC that they could have their to get the extra two attacks in to get the extra bit of damaged and obviously trample stacking up you get the auto tax done from Alice star on top of all of that I just really nice layering of those four different species eventually soattempted of fries from Golden Guardians was trash like it was a nice attempt to catch the way up there and it's a freeze and then a bunch of gold next PS I have to recall it was managed there's only two minutes left and it's right in front of it this way will always be a gate because it didn't register anyway it's not going to do anything bad for them so I still got to the cannon Miss Zero cast minions mrs. to mail eyes and the only tonight to mail a minions and not mean that lost them you'll get it almost all the gold XP that said when is do they still got pressure over the lane with a means that ain't no problem with the Drake and Steph exactly sono the wave gets pushed out stick that yes he's not denying any minions videos won't lose anything because you did reset it moves over to the Dragon's egg rock that for themselves so not too bad overall I would say and I was just kind of depends what you want to prioritize do you want to prioritize the gold from from a freeze or you know going for those early stacking dragons and in this case I think with Calista it can make sense to try to move towards a quick or Sol and we'll see if he'll be able to continue that Zack can go in forward okay well this talking is going all right Farm free equal across the border into drugs are going to bootcamp each other if we get a reply the top play fight that we haven't seen exactly what has happened here I can't really break down cuz I have no idea but it was okay so flash ultimate they're looking for the spear from speak of but Niles able to flash out from that so what is just a trait of flashes from those top cleaner to me obviously spending the ultimate that's not really a big deal for an are generally speaking it's up anytime you do want to use it the cooldown isn't very long but Niles going to be happy to
