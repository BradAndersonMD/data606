ring in Moon who was the academy jungler at the start of the Season play to the first three games went to and one with the LG Academy here up on the main stage as well getting into rotation but this one you have to get him most Academy Sport actually only one and three with the line of soap have had some troubles the academy legal to see if they can step up onstage here yeah of course he did retain their bottom Lane as well as what most people are looking at Frost in 6 days while the team didn't have that great success by a tear those two were very good stuff people looking for a kind of the bottom of triangle of the math to do a lot of work for CLC email let's see how the academy guys do for optic Gates violin almost always yeah pretty much every time I've ever seen him so very happy to see where they are going to pull out here catching sharks band out on their side definitely big Stella Lane power fixed for the current meta and Galileo will join those two as wellall right well waiting to see the last couple bands to come through is healed to get rid of a star. Car fixed and I most believe they would call them carries and pain Rengar cause it to be in there they got yelled at on Twitter the jungle Air Supply would like to see you as well so I'm very sure there is a lot of tank so far in the ALCS in the fridge before it hit the rest is up or God is available right now rakan is available I mean file Frost work on is one of the best for time that I have seen and I had to get a lot of League of Legends free so I guess that goes through this first phase I would expect the LG to pick that one up for their bottle and as wellvery quick with those engaged you can combos are with the w make a super fast they felt like they really wanted to get the Impala first people I say that definitely worth it it could go to dark on but I would expect them to give that one to powerview Belen you don't put that amount of playmaking in his hands, for the self Champions or got the most tickets 2019 season so far in Pro Dry Dock on Camille's getting pretty strong as well as around Camille top us out of place but it seems unlikely you call the raconte that's in the Percy LG as well so cruelly gamepressure and counter logic gaming to lock and lovers do it on his bottom size by a giant you at 6 a.m. biofrost 115 their match up taking on any comers optic brings out pretty nicely for COC how they want the draft to go they've been able to acquire powerfor kind of there three Power Players very early in this bat meme at some flexible fix for themselves with one of the most about the most I can still be Flex the top weight as well around with this. So if either of those two can't take either Lane Crown you think of him as kind of like the malzahar guy right look out has a lot of option A lot of Versatility can't play defensively can't do play make it for the team as well it kind of fits with what you think of when you think of crown and I will do it come through on this one as we wait to see Greg is back and drag it depicts the moon has brought out and Academy league so far and I think tanks on a little bit of Spanish is not going to play Zack crappy of a game I still feel like they need Frontline probably stop and don't know the write-ups composition but we'll see if you will come through AlistairI'm getting rid of food Gates off computer as well we get to see of marshmallow have asked it is well by himself so we'll see the marching band comes in a collie right now with the police guarding against it because wassaja can be versus I mean girls looking through Tompkins also gone as well good Defenders of course when you got to call her running around you want to get rid of the options that can defend yourself against a champion so here we go the last you round to fix optic she was once a student needs a flatliner there a spice that played it once already in the academy leave I still got locked and I'm pretty sure and I got to find me defensive maybe like a Brownsburg 8 keep him alive very limited competitive history on Asta I had a little competitive play last year in various minor leagues outside of the outside of Academy itself formerly known as she played this week in Academy so very very short resume here for us before we can't without a tremendous amount of course and a list and lock you in place so it's going to be about how kids feel defendant is a feel very excited to see this one I get that poke through the minions bush is a wave on her as well so that the lasagna cannot Rome and Leona are leaving the charge to sign those dyes cleanse the mall. Even though the cumulative either Sophia we could be under a lot of threat those tanks are not defensive wounds were content of hard time feeling yeah and if there's opens up with the ultimate long-range garage people did Lyoto can throw down her own head and put a stop to that pretty quickly. Long range on that one as well okay last 20 seconds of fiction band is going to be no more trades we'll see what it looks like but it looks really fun to do battle spirits to make his house yesterday View for the year said to watch the Power of evil and frown at work both these players are truly excellent will be fun to watch them do battle for the coaches come out we get the handshakes do on one coaching Advantage for all right ready to get on the field for our third game of the day freak Fieldy and optic making some of that later changes to their roster. Even though we know who was the Texans are starting jugular who's very recently added as their started juggler I also coming from Academy League will see move another face once again after getting head Step Beyond Seas they wanted us try all 10 players get them the stage experience maybe even compare how to do on stage 2 scrims figure out their best 5 players moving into the late fees in and moon like the first time he's been around the ALCS of fair bit was Clara at the bit to find his next chance into the main stage he's got that opportunity CLG Novia great start to take down. At the Contemporary of his maimuna. Came up at about the same time that. Like I feel like found a lot more success you can do to find starting spots on teams throughout the ALCS moon to take about a year and Academy and thought he was deserving of a starting spot but no the given the opportunity now he has it again with CLD no see if they can keep that under control from self now as we do get ourselves into the game awfully caught up with Optics coach that booty in earlier in the day these guys I did catch up with Sabaton earlier in the day about the surprise roster switch and seeing a lot of Academy players coming in he told me that are all still has to wait for his Visa before he's able to play so that's why they decided to put in pasta today but because they only had one week of practice and they really wanted to set him up for Success they decided to pair him with Kate the academy support so that they have the best energy and then it was just a domino effect from their gate have the best Synergy with our dog so they decided put him into and you know what why not throwing a Lauren while you're at it but the one thing that he did want to stress is that this isn't just a team of five rookies these are all experienced players and you need to treat them as such back to you now thank you very much I've laid out so far going to talk to you is kind of said the same sort of things that don't have a domino effect in that one games before and now they're ready to go yeah I mean Crown extremely experienced tell ya that played on the biggest of stages as well as the one member from the original amount starting roster that's still in rice out out and put the entire Academy in monitor here though so it won't be very long and the opening started this now we're talking about the jugglers initially because we're focusing on moon as well start a clear both guys that just came in here and moon on the stage one he does have some decent Synergy with darshan in the Top Lane who's take ignite on a collie I think I want to point out here at night to pee no flash yeah it's it's definitely more risky a call he does have a lot of Escape moves already in the kit the sometimes you know you still obligated to you that's actually damage there for the all ends with her because she could snowball super effectively as an assassin as soon as you get your level six even in a champion against the champion like her got it is definitely possible and they can stack up the stunts for 6:20 very quickly however. Here is on Camille and once again Redbox level 2 you get priority yeah you in almost all those Jewels Szechuan he can fight OK the most for damage to the breakups your ETA about a minute-and-a-half by the way to her back into the game so pretty soon here darshan on your screen capital and lowercase r as in all chat so both optic Enfield you saying they're ready and we might get our unpause very soon here in this so the next time I want to watch for if you can come out ahead on your colors going to be exciting this guy I had been a really high top with her for a while I feel like the last year or two has been a little weaker for him but he was a game or he's on a house it's Off The Rez paston in the akali and he gets go back up to be that has her household and he was before he is taking the risk here no flash going for the extra damage and night definitely especially late game can take out a lot of a squishy members Health use that even on junglers this is free ignite Nerf well so a lot of times if it goes up against there a poor moment you can just immediately turn on the jugular try and focus them down ignite and you know come out with a one-for-one or even i-140 at times especially if you have something like Triumph ultimate comes through on to this is also running late to work for the healing right keep yourself alive throughout all this the result secondary for the region and let's see what comes out CLG looks like they're going to be playing for the land of the bottom line it's going to be a call Li Li Shang for Sedgwick. Leasing for Camille biofrost going to get face pic Spygate not going to do much here just as the client q6 I got to leave Hotel Bossier very potent level one as file Frost able to give it a shield from Bayeux France that is a great start already sealed G they're bothering was the strength last year and they're already starting this way again welcome to the LCS takes that trade and he unloads almost three-quarters of the hell bar there was going to be a lot of ground to make up be mile topside Camille did go red and scrubbed it. Trying to take tops pedal securing some xtra-vision here for alarm on the ergot know if left to his own devices or got very good Laney doesn't want any sort of intervention from the stage one that's where I could get dicey and they probably could start snowballing you got to be careful about this Camille things can get dicey really easily and let's see what comes through the valley still being pushed in we've seen I have to do his best with the week Lena deciding to Torrid in Farmington came out to win off the sure a bad start to Lenny Facebook and certainly come back later on we'll see how this plays out if she'll be coming through not for MSDS off by 6:00 a river be taken Now by noon since pretty safe here and both shuttles will go over there. I forgot my Chase shoe and rest of his jungle ready to be taken soon enough to be able to do a coming over so I gotta catch might just know he loses this yeah I do like when you know we'll head up for Scuttle controls try to spend it with our dog had moved to Scuttle all the way up to the top side but necessary if you really had to use it to secure so it was closer than they are with a female that is usually the goal because she's not that great at clearing her own can definitely like to take advantage as well as getting a vision now Leona always poses a great setup for a Camille as well that's why you can see the bottom line backing way off your they know Camille is bottom side or at least was 30 seconds ago because level three on the Leona respectful to level six optic running why are zte's Elaine has one so they threw out the making should have freaking push priority is zero tolerance I have to deal with all their own spells to do this this could matter in the mid game maybe is Drake spawns up you get maybe a good Lane Bush and suddenly and objective goes there a way by Drake is give me the first responding this one could be nice Moon just probably getting the first Rico gets the Blues night. I've got boots on top of that recall so lightly you better powerspec pick me up
