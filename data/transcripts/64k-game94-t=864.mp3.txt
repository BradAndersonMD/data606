bringing his skill as a mid laner for everyone has stated his skill in coaching from his briefs in with the smoke was so favorite coming into this one especially after 6. Yesterday in the current meta freeway Flex 2 jungles off and support at the moment very good Playmakers but Evil Genius has first pick for the champion and don't want to let the guilty get it on the back playing at least I could go yeah definitely a strong Champion overalls receive their ass off the bad no surprises here to EG second-place finisher from the regular season in the spring split couldn't quite go all the way up last I'll be very strong performer overall in the wait at the band Kix down and come through and I'm also very intrigued to the continued growth of Kumo here in the Top Lane he wasa picture of a couple of games on cloud nine last year at exist the couple of games that they can sell them out for the team to let you know as soon but hey come on we're going to play it right he has some good games and you know got a top three in his first Real Steel starting split Ferry G in the postseason and hope he hasn't been an All-Star by any real mean I don't want to seem to keep going up right this is his first year as a full-time starter ended it. That's a really good time for the rest of these bands closed DLC pack 6 really heavily on the bottom Lane and bangs disease was the second best 80 karrie of spring split and all of the LPS so I do like that Focus they whittled down taking out some of the biggest Lane bullies and some of the biggest early-game ones Neil Calista and Barrett both extremely strong right nowdrill are probably the next to in my power rankings to be carried and they've grown ass is Campion and of course Azrael this dude Estep incorporation into the field for the nation whose God not only his own escapes and plenty of folks to throw down with the UV but we'll have no armor from Scotland as well as the field and just becomes one of the 80 carries it's actually hard to kill in a meadow everyone's complaining about how easy it is but you got to give me over here to the Lulu hover on the EEG sides we are getting double enchanters down here in the bottomlands but also Yeah you mentioned up dance but item got buffed in the middle of spring split is itBruce Lee ABS birdly stronger Melody item for Marksman as well as melee 80 Champions bruising like face might want to pick it up for example and yeah she can you do some what's Tastefully go for lethality build if you wants to go and you're not even a definite lead over top of that one as well if you want to kill switch TV that can even have more responsibilities so yeah I always a fan of the Infiniti of Hurricane availability for the most common and bang weave no is absurdly good at putting down damage in a lake GameCube ISO definitely him a lot in late-game I went to lose Fortune which would be nice going to Trumbull here for spent staring up in the jungle. It looks really good as well so easy have a very dirty fotopigeon already ate exactly this it's already we can classify both of these games I'm suppose strategies from both teams in literally the first half of the picture because this is very clear to the inside front to back from evilyou dissed you have to have three main ingredients that you all want a team like that you have your front line so I know who can also spread the enemy front line with the ultimate and then you're in cancer to buff up descaling 80 karrie of rebellious you mentioned secret and hurricane Bill to your perfect for the five people feel deep for them to try and Dodge the initiation which come in as the usual counter to post composition as they ban out now yeah yeah it's really better talk later Lucille teeth like we didn't really have a plan with thorns Emmaus lightband real quick cuz he wasn't let it stop there yet has a 612 Sure Fire way and so I like a Storm's already gone Malachi is not the most reliable engage unexpected out of the top so I'm Not Guilty band IIshe might want to have a nice game. Some of that first the block certainly very scary because it's a protection man A lot of times info competition you yourself don't have a lot of your own targeted crowd control until you can get picked apart by something like love lost that you really do need someone to go to lock them down later or closed are able to get a lot of McKinney skate and talk to your front line and we're going to ride it out with the galio there for the last one they don't want the extra protection from that cross map ultimate to come inall this would be what would expect to see me for more poke as yes indeed Lily comes through for Wiggly did get buff do patches go more Joplin top damaged the lake steamed hams Alta worth more experience about 15 into the game on words to spawn a power Farm a later on the game and remains a high-level haikal done with a chance you can really rely on that I love Italy I think she's so incredibly good it takes a very strong player to actually find success with a champion because you have to be on the game plan of supporting your in facing and try to keep our farm not just your side of the mat power farming the enemy's invading the enemy's a harassing them with beers is stuck with Bigsby component to this camp at black man. You got to Love Field quadrupling down on a poke composition the name of the Game Force EOD is hate your skill shot or lose the game too slowevery single Champion is this and usually you need something to tie it together something to go to at least land some sort of initiation for them some sort of crowd control maybe some sort of disengage I like them and then they find a find like a stank gum out Tire some of the top Lane. But it mustn't happen well as engaged but had to say I'd like to meet Jesus coming out to try and pray it does go a long way yes it is a far better look for CLG what's the Players Club Champions with its PAW Patrols I feel like catfish look very good in the poppy who wants to buy Sunstar he wants my armor and bass can I think pretty cleanly going to releaseplastic fuel pump failure to the state that's not happening right cat has been cleansed expecting devices to fate Brewing on The Chase has the expected Low Top Lane but is that is that wrong to think that way I don't think it's wrong to think that way I would say there is an extra wrinkle that you do need to consider of their jungler is a P4 CLG so wherever the Cassiopeia goes I would not want my Lane opponent to go to rush the magic resist you mention poppy wanting to build Sunfire if they have a topside the map that is nidalee Cassiopeia then the puppy very clearly is going to be able to rush magic resistance Twisted Fate usually doesn't do that because he tries to get the extra manner or go to Rod of Ages build even to be a little bit more Tanki most Twisted Fates are AP nowadays suck some 8 so I do agree but I definitely see it this way as both got Sophia and Jace can run the face recipe extra mobility and get the kiting and then you kind of avoid the problem of RussiaBMR alrighty well we are onto the ramp for our first game of the day Evil Genius is a 1-0 start to the LCS 2020 Summer split CLG on the right hand side the tenth place finisher from last split but are looking to improve and everyone gets a lot of how to pull out there thinks he can do it and continue to lead this squad Susan success and Wiggly is going to have a lot of pressure on his shoulders this game on Middle East is definitely a champion vet really rewards you being skillful and smart with your engages and I would say last year so much lately was very good. When ruined join the roster in the night 2019 summer I thought it was a really big Improvement in Wiggly played with a while and see what you got all the third place in the 2019 summer playoffs that all went away on the TVyeah it's it's definitely did I'll go away and go see very clearly last split super rough time at the bottom of the standings for for Victoria told police actually Wiggly going to start on the top side though as expense Karen I really closely do you want you track please leave happier because Kendall is definitely an opponent jungle Champions that Italy has a lot of extra control over if there's trouble can not fuel Force things on the noodley speaking and he can get Vision you can try and throw a filler in right away and you can try and Dodge those beers but it's it's really in the control of the Adobe Player and the newly players Lane to play off of he's just doing a what looks like a full size red tide clear to stop down here and maybe that does signal some more pressure came at Bangin basil as big as they still areChristine Fulton falls asleep or she sticks out in the day off of the waves and they've been busy Half Men already by Lennon Tabasco sauce on a smoothie that can flight Lee hamper the UE laning phase where we got the look now we're Relic Shield is very very, and an enchantress down here now you don't often get to hit it pretty much on Facebook you're very much so you get some more guaranteed golden come by just left it with Relic Shield one Savory waiver so and I didn't receive your items on time if you want to go for the spell thief but in this case just make sure we get the golden company item flights looking at bottom crab for Weebly can finish his full clearif we can get an isolation of the Top Lane matchup though that will really favor Co G2 favor ruin as you know before poppy gets her first back to go back and get some more resistance is it pretty much Jace gets the free rein you can see the phase Rush Brock their ruin constantly leaving Indy's Auto attacks While, most trying to scrape up some CS it's also important Lane drop into the brush on the side so you drop any Dominion Agra values game so you can retain control of the wave but that's why I like we believe doubling back to top crab and try to gain some more Vision some more security here for ruin I've been sippin able to get this isolation and they do have double damage types of fear with ap jongleur and AD top lanerright now looking at the top of a match up though it's not too bad to fight the isolation yukumo only down for csgo has two biscuits in his health bar with ruins Mana bar in Rouen is almost out of Mana to poke with so it feels like Uma has weather most of the early storm will see they would level five two shot bus come down not yet there we go but that's going to cost me a hundred soul man every time and female the first biscuit is just going to be able to sustain it feels like just enough has the shield X out now and then holding on so far OK junglers thingy close Wells or as time goes on up nights when there are no problems and is the acceleration gatehe doesn't slow so that was a crucial flash new the Kumon could follow up humo I see flashes going to land the slam as well it's only been so much worse for you invest expected to come through with less it's the mid lane toppling going to be a sequel and farm the Roku to bring TV pretty soon as a ruined already has but can we need to shortly to highlight in that little Skirmish Affair is the speed like you're talking about really was cognizant of the combo he knows exactly what you're looking for it's it's one of those poppy + anyone who can create to rain probably the funniest one is Poppy and if you are then they have nothing in the back but trouble putting up the pillar as soon as it's their ruin knows that that's what they're looking for stuff they do get the the Flash's traded I think that is it's one of those things that you've yourself or specifically looking for with Kumo and you have 14 X Games writing flashes being cognizant of the offensive tools that your opponentall bode well for egn for their young stop winner already so you'll probably send a message to the logs stored as the first recalls up in that lane since Karen gets his upgraded Smite he got a while back when you recall that's doing the bottom scuttle-butt some ability power now in and more damage Sports dicks acld forcibly little farm down here you can see bang Russian Executioner's calling to try to make sure those trade looked very good against booty keep my smoothie has not only his normal you speak it but also Summerhill on that one so really cut down on that dealing with to be a few very effective and I'll see if I can actually going to do some kind of feel fresh down there finding the group Dixie. A200 help if we leave out of manifest but now it's light in the top side of the map is the damage far too much Wiggly cannot get away First Blood come soon Azucar Kumo able to get the road off to the enemy jungler see if ruin let them out those going to find him at the gate and
