competitive lane, two different styles around that tool Golden Gardens looking for the early stacking of those dragons psf trying to go for the gold lead and then can test at number three but golden Guardians came up big when it matter most securing the two contested dragons hatching out DSM when they miss positioned up around that Top Lane and as a result they did take down that game number one so we'll find out if there going to be any sort of a changes in pick ban I don't really think there needs to be honestly on either side I feel like that was a very very close game and you don't even if you are on the TSM side I don't think you're going to look at that game and be like oh yeah everytime he was going to secure two dragons then we're going to lose like that you know it feels feels like it could be overcome for both point of views your teeth and picking redside both times here they are the higher speed of course communicating once they get site selection and then the loser of Any Given game gets I'd like to in the next 2 years and still wants to read cited still want counterpick this time they aretake the gun by Banning away the chef trying to get Hotspot they can't just ignore him. Smith also to see if they drop the Morgana band I'd like to point on the Analyst at talking about if you're going to go far, lastic you if you don't need to Ben Moore gone out or gone as good as you're likely to deal with that, and Ashton Deluxe actually was so I think that could make a lot of sense there also is the ability to Braxton with Echo if you're concerned about that but Golden Gardens going to take it in a different direction we do now I'm curious Realty at them walk into their middling or here instead of going for a top laner recetas last time around to try to avoid more potential band getting thrown towardsI was Boulevard last time this time it's going to be to lease a pick up their clothes or thought about it over and gave him one but it with the option up to revisit his jungle Champions has no no going over here so humble a new look out of round to last time this time it's going to be picked up Lilia was the band that was dropped off by TSM for the shin but that wasn't actually selected various things are still just going to allow beards into tank even more advanced and end this does feel pretty intentional for the side of the SMU do you grab the orange here for Broken Blade you could then then out to the top laners that you are worried about contesting that orange from author and then you have a Buick Century probably go to thank you have more advanced in and have to be picking here even what it will be a more difficult situation 40th Samsung okay we asked for. Play arrange for in the bottle by TSM good of them to do so and it's okay yeah heroes are on top of heroes are inI think we're going to once again traffic bot Lane it's pretty likely to be a Karma down there and if it's something else is fine we'll figure out the matchup but we have Hartig a tree out front because play a default team fight and just get damage output from Topeka duerksen and double it or are they really blinded, now though right because if you actually try to take the pic and then we'll have to have additional answer you know beyond Morgana because they can't just take them organized sell counterfeit us bills now so that is something that does have to change it to you think they're going to Blind the karma 4th then and hope it golden Guardians has no more after this far as the poor fool goes I do think there are digital answers and then cuz other great matchups you into the karma takes like nah me if you go down immediately I actually think you'll slam that late but I'm not sure that he will be willing to play at we haven't really been thinking come out I also think that potentially the fact that she attempted been out any top laners and blindthat is somewhat punishable Hunters a guy who's actually very flexible up in the top line he has shown the kale before that is very popular GP is also an option if they want to look to play towards that bottom Lane utilized EF ultimate as well as GPL truly Focus ZTS and bought late again so there are some vulnerabilities to this DSM draft and they're actually wow so if you stay the convert 4 lakh I feel like Golden Gardens is for sure going to take it themselves but I guess we'll find out if you have to wait and see you right now Pantheon is the hoverboards will be excited to come through but I don't think play a tank and feel a lot better as like a Leona or something down the traffic North the whole thing but waiting for the top laner to answer broken play Surah Noor ayat in a week past that one kind of gone mordekaiser going to be there at a scrap of the top side of the old Deacon make or not do a whole lot of anything and by the way also absolutely loves death row support just like you have a hobby or a car or somethingability power and then just you're always get so you know but it isn't as well so bored in particular for Hootie relief techniques for the kills are you already have Lantern for the defense of utility is less about the poke in the actual straight-up Landing in the first year but you can actually have all the ins against you no farther than and Caitlin navigate to themselves into a pretty good ankle here to pick fresh fuel in their previous series the only times as they have fresh it was into a pumpkin to know anymore, which really is not kind of how you want to play it so I think we're pretty happy with this now they've added some additional engage they were perhaps concerned with with the few ways they had to actually start bites last time Donald do they have the appbest time to have thrush Oaks at Warren ultimate that is going to be pretty powerful one of the concerns I have for them is if they want to play that same style we're giving up the first two dragons and looking to steal two words with the word which I feel like they might be doing with his salary of composition you have to remember the other team has mordekaiser and can eliminate the possibility of the 50/50 sometimes we have seen how to be so on point with this where you show up that Third Bank me like all right we're ready to fight and then gets bored if eyes are all stood and they take the dragon for free and then we'll see how they want to do it cuz that it does feel like with Oriana or you want to sit back and scale a bit and in a Golden Gardens may be more ready to scrap for those are the dragons going to be a fun game to watch absolutely I'm still going to look at it look at bottom in a whole lot there can be so they can set up topside is not send with Vlad Vlad from Full House and doesn't have taken so he can't get a gank on his side either it's going to be spicy in every singlewhen he was going to be a lot of fun to watch the efforts Oriana the global run around the map Bjorn in gauges and we'll see what the bot Lane looks like here as well as getting a game to as Golden Gardens rf10 in this best of 5 and if I look at bot Lane a little bit I do want to point out that DSM does not need a hard counter pick every single time to win this across the 12 regular-season games that double up in biofrost played doubles had the best overall golden XP difference at 10 of all starting 80 carries me to get over all had very very very strongly with biofrost across the first well and so I want to see if they can hold that one. Because in playoffs if you are who we have an absolutely taking names down there they've been crushing it but last game to the credit of TSM I do think that they were wanting to take me to straight up close or had some great gang sand and they capitalized well on that you know it wasn't like they were getting crushed by any means before that it was barely even but I clearly tsm's bottom Lane Performing better than what I'm around for that is due to the pics for thatplay will have to see if they can keep that level up going into this one is Cleanse This Time Around 4 or from FBI so he is paying that tax because it's not only to ask but also the freshest I'm so I do think it makes sense there is also less rate up kind of a big beefy frontliners ahead of it so you don't have to Shannon this involve are standing up there to tank arrows for you come see five times more likely that you would need to climb in the situation of the ward at the bushes been golden Guardian to know what the other one down that brush time out is that was the earliest place of the recall switch the sweeper push goes in as far does a better early fighter than fresh the more reliable and even play it was learned Dauphin right now doublelift is on perfect CS or it's only 10 or 12 for FBI so we'll see how much more the app can get here as Hotshot reveals that closer did three cans of blue bus me know which weekend of Sargon Hot Cheetosbills of recant Barker's know exactly what the least we've been doing so far is actually going to have full information there that always feels really really nice as the opposing jump wouldn't know where he is where he could be they have that pushed on the bottom side the are kind of assuming the Golden Gardens is going to challenge for that bottom side Scuttle and then it's going to be up to speaker to say okay do I want to try to answer this do I want to at least get a Ford down here to protect us have no more sense we had a good first time by FBI or so it is very well played and what will see if they can follow up on this so they're trying to push it out right now because maybe they checking his lease in though and we'll see if we can get fined if the slogan for today to think who he thought there was more of a fight to be had but there was not one there wasn't but if he could have found that angle off of it and maybe follow up there either way he's not able to flyThe Binding so in the long run get them can't reset the wave but they got to Summoners big summer soon as I got the clients in the flash so that it can be feeling really really nice could trade up here on that top side for Broken Blade and we'll see if he s m can utilize this little Skirmish Advantage if they have gotten to try to get something more lies on this side of the map very small gold Goldie to Golden Gardens of that is fraudulent with Twisted Fate packages getting free gold that's despite the fact that he's playing the lane going to be really easily cleaned up going to see her first three calls were too terribly long as we can see more items being formed by Broken watch kids at the mask online. We don't have to worry about that fight too much and feed to give you the grand his side of the Jungle taken down the chicken gift and he saw that we're getting place that's always feels bad man forward to Monday cuzwhere did you place it does get cleared out and and for me personally anytime I'm in that type of situation of always feeling really nervous it's like he knows that I know he's there so is he going to expecting it you know if she feels like a little bit of that my game but clothes were tapping up so you felt comfortable to stay around and farm it up wasn't worried about the Rays game coming in and of course not exactly in there so it's going to be safe and that looks like your son will try to shut out one more wave and then reset well Demonte just is going to wait in Days Inn in Flowood CP here knocked off of Route 33 Jenning decently well overall gold is tied across these he said he carries the same at a farm this is the way if you want to recall hospice you could be to be a pro 245 PS that's more than enough to make it work Tim so pretty standard stuff in a bit.Island gold overall pretty close across every roll under a hundred across in any image will match up top in a weird spot it's over extending a forcing her to walk out to do this he was going to want it back before to kill everyone either death but with M D6 on that way that's why they looks like Hank I know the gang Clifton awkward like well it's pretty low chance of work that's really your last chance to actually can't work I just waited so long that's at the Monterey Pop it very early and I think Haddy not done that I think they kill thrush because they could have had the new The Binding into the gold card instead they just had to buy a new year expired use a blue flash out they have beer and not able to get the ball over in time in and get that Shockwave down was little bit late I think he was trying to go for the deliberate timing of a pulling leasing out of the portal perhaps but either way not going tobe able to get to kill there so it is just a couple Summers off of biofrost and now we can see a small gold in the face of speaker but as fun house away was manicure to go to Garden favor tablet has forced to be on the trip with your bf for 280 Carrie at the Midlands going back to Lane be stuck button problem and the early Cloud Drake will go over a few real great picked up a portal on his friends are the first time for a Demonte is impactful a word that previously was getting caught there actually forced him to be on a reset and he couldn't just stay out on the map when he was that low so that means that double as fast as he could go over the way but double pass to allow FBI and who need to push of it and that is exactly why he's under the part when they can start that Dragon so you know even though they didn't get the kill on biofrost the chain of events after it actually LED them to getting the first dragon which is really reallyplay for Golden Guardians going to be able to start off on the right foot here once again in game 2 without any issues York since the guys low Nicki Street on our way in fact he's doing. The Monte not enough right now to guarantee a crush on your Midland weather from the Blue Beats. Jungle that side of the Jungle really entirely is safe right here he goes to move around in his Bread close to go see second time. This is so far it's the kind of two games where speakers when playing with his grades and he's actually been getting CS advantages but it is been closer investing is time and actually helping out the rain did a lot of damage to fight does get knocked out the rest away from The Dock of the DiMaggioguy was too healthy but it will force recalls black overall I don't think he hasn't come out of there because they got both the ultimate and the TP actually off
