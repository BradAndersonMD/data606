ability to actually perform with multiple different styles of compositions i e g on the other end as you say another were pretty high expectations for them coming in here too and I do think that those got even higher at the beginning of the split when they were looking so dominant look like they were really know picking up right where they had left off if they were continuing that upward trajectory that we had seen throughout spring as they started off kind of slow and got better and better and better, but they have hit some some stumbles now you know they haven't had a lot of of Queen games lately you know all three of their losses I think we're pretty one-sided you do for it for the opponent so we'll see how he does look here today. Just something that I've kind of had my eye on a lot lately it is really gaining in popularity quite a bit of this is a pic that is both strong and Lane it helps out your jugular a lot that is something they think people are really kind of underwriting about it in this counter jungling meta Hotshot is so valuable you know giving you the information of which side of the map the opposing Gungor it's on do you know if you can actually invade and seal to a cancer or not you know thatsuch a core part of League of Legends in this meta and Ash bring that very very well yes it is also a suitcase most played mid laner but this felt so cord the golden Guardians winds that I'm just surprised it be exempt to bite the bullet and say no no no we were so worried about you for speaking your kind of picking us that that's what I mean not on the table at all chords still plenty of 80 carries and still up Calista and Ezreal decently strong in this patch at 10:30 Nazgul the hover Ezra and lock in there for bank so, has gotten your really really popular because it's becoming a flex has been a lot of marks and John was getting Ryan and did these kind of double Mercantile, there are very popular around the world or mid and you can also do have a secondary interest I'll support volveras Affleck tr22 this could be gone. This could become a maid or support and so far he's been staying with with quite a bit of flexibilityI wouldn't I wouldn't mind the Kindred at all Kindred is actually quite a decent match up into the volibear and if you do go that route you're also denying perhaps one of the competition that you could be looking for a with this, which is that double Marksman style since Grace has already bent and Kendra would be the only one available but trundle pretty safe pretty standard Suzuki was the champion that he kind of really made his name for himself in the spring split that the chance that I think most teams did not want to do they play ever again at the same as brake fluid games that he gets to make his debut on this camping this is a a thing I had wanted to see from him for a while I'm glad he's back here on adding to be very very exciting going to get you out of this one and forth on the other side game for FBI only a second of the split but he played a lot of it back in Spring as well in FBI sent to be very good lately maybe carry such a nerd like a Valiumsomeone who is willing to play it even with you be banned out you know you can husband been going down in priority since the nurse on 1013 but as real as getting pair with a lot of enchanters a lot of these solid support and I've been getting seated this even compared with caramel with Bard's even with with Lulu and some of the style of Champions that gives you very, these days to pair vs girl with a rain support and look for in a little more of a postal Lane where you can play the Ezra out more aggressively instead of just kind of sitting back in an AMF gang at the Torah twitch a lot of those mail a flood Azrael Lanes do tend to be a lot of fun. They can get something else to poke out for the back lot of course we do gold got his dick in the car by themselves but as you mentioned chance like Lulu's still available on Parkland Ami will see what I can come through here I'll keep my Degan the volibear is flexible we don't know if it's jungle in the front door now or Top Lane blind you know if we're going to get rid of the dateyeah they both are honestly at this point and I wouldn't be surprised to see him bring out something like the Nautilus that if that is still available in HD is fairly low and engage in Outlook has been a favorite of diesel over the years, pelios very strong competition there and if you do go with the brown that would mean it is karma mid that's kind of how this is super-powered of Elio's but you have the defense when Brom you have the speed up in the shielding from that, you really are looking kind of just protect this one hyper carry style Nautilus also you know what works well but it's okay so it's going to be, support this should be lissandra mid I really can't get going top and lysandra is kind of one of those classic answers to La Flaca point-and-click CC the ultimate in particular really is powerful is LeBlanc have to dive in there it is very fragile if you can do a lot of birth in his reliant on the mobility on in restoring for distorting backwards and plus I'm talking into that pretty easily so this will be a tricky game for did you get wellflowers favorite as big as a locksmith top ten salon and I will say this is not for the landmass of it to bowl someone out there will be a little bit awkward but you can take the car and fix Goodreads in through it it's not the worst thing in the world we look at the match of overall but it does mean that engage options are available for EG to Wukong come through at the top when it's pretty easy with a clone for organized into and eat your flash can even be in there as well but you can close the gap barely effectively to start off team fights python catch as you said answer is built on to Ultimate quite well also does help to go out to the side Lanes to try to reinforce it will block want to play split for style it will be Volver David Lee sin gets locked in so not wanting to play Volver in thejungle I do think that this is a good early matchup for the fall of air into the Wukong you really do want to just kind of take a shorter trays at the volibear know so that will calm can't get as much out of that passive with really knew the extended trading patterns restart to regen a lot research get those cool down as backup but this is a pretty interesting game I do tend to favor golden Guardians like straight-up v e v I think it's a lot easier to come you don't but I do have the ability to get fixed if you have the ability to be out probably more effectively to the sidelines of the block as well and I will stay Golden Gardens Portland is somewhat limited it's it's at least, Shields that helps leasing can you live at that house full of where the topping should have plenty of stats but other than most other kind of turning on target once in a while you're almost on single front line with a trundle on in the side at a time catch there is well to make a lot of it look pretty easy on the EEG side so we both can be quite good LeBlanc I'm just not quite the same team fight Champion but just in caseblock is so good he finds the openings you find the burst and a squishy, support is going to get one shot at least once in this game I'm pretty sure if you can tell me he's a game at all intrigued to see how these cops actually do play out as far as starting out to fight through, the one side was Sandra I think the primary tool on the other closer of course can find those cool Ward Hopsin the kicks in and all that kind of fun stuff can happen but overall can be very exciting game I think these things are fairly close in in skill right now at Golden Gardens got robbed of a couple of their of their wins and if their record should look like closer. To eegee's and it does today and it's going to be fun game that should be really interesting is it was a very interesting compositions I think you know as you say clear go buttons I think I always always makes it kind of fun to watch it will seem to know exactly what they're looking for know what they have to prevent what they have to be able to ask you. And you know it it's kind of just who's gonna be able to handle that better but I do expect easy to look more for skirmishes more for controlling vision and finding people out of brushes with things like they'll Blancthey do think if you'd have like a full Envision straight-up v e v their front-line killing in the best yes or not look incredible tanks on the other side but it's going to be tricky for LeBlanc anytime you go in if you do get it up by Lisandro in a team fight you can't expect to just get hundreds of zero than that so probably going to be a bit of the evasive playing to go out to the side lane try to get some of the rotate try to catch them in rotation try to have multiple people go to one side of the map and it looked at a key at the okay to walk for as we get ourselves on the summoner's rift vs golden garden spider versus three and five of these teams will finish up their first round robin which is play each of the other nine teams once and I'm going to sit around 50/50 I'm going to spend a little time talking to Golden Gardens they have yet in their history of a League of Legends spinach a split above 500 they have never gone 10 and 8 or better coming to the split I thought this was the rust that would do it this the team that can find 10 or more I thought they couldplay Big Boss 2 games with dragon soul like if you just finished out those games that is 5 and 3 going into maybe 6 or 3 if you can close one out that is the kind of start that Golden Gardens have loved to have seen again very very close lost have kept them sub 50% but I think the back half the split this game included can definitely go well as closer does a leash looks red is going to be threw up there be able to help me poop form of what they had in the spring split where they were the second or third best team is the composition that they drafted in those clothes washers right in and the advantages that they threw away sometimes to actually not be able to close out those games because oftentimes you know in those early stages they were drafting things like Natalie like Jason do all early game you know high-tempo high pressure and they're crazy normous leaves because failing to close it out so it is obviously difficult if you draft in a more for the late game then put yourself in that advantageous position and we'll see you know what tourist style they want to kind of go back to his that's a cute little mini game there you could see as his UK distorted forward Demonte is expecting just okay to destroy backwards when he cast a spell so he actually threw his cue towards where the Distortion would go back to and just took actually just held on Interstate in for an additional Auto so dodging it out and there's lots of little mini games in this matchup with one of the reasons I kind of like it you know as lesandro you're trying to actually landed W immediately as LeBlanc distort in to Route LeBlanc and Proctor Aftershock so you can have a chance of winning no Trace it's already a play as they still wants to walk up can't quite find the slope as Fiskar knows he was not spotted on the way in the early enough clothes there a Boston butt look how long did Montag has already under 200 hp distorts away Stay The Life of Frederick Summers as he is up one Camp the trundle if both gates going about too much is generally not going to look this one-sided he hasn't getting the better of so many of these trades and then what is actually going to have to keep it back already which is pretty rough because you know if we could actually see to do K be able to just get this way push and you may not be able to do it but since Karen is here so I'm going to try shows up and they just asked for the wave in you can actually hold your TV and it just be able to walk straight back to Lane you'll get a much better by and still have that teleport available for a later on I'm Soo the case of the Shelf comes on the bottom side of the Guardians limit early teleport he got post down quite a bit FBI last in the same pole it's not the worst recall ever but it means his tears talking to be a lot later than I wanted to normally would love to have you do a 1200 gold or so first Recon Ezreal by to your TV back and then play the farm-out game FBI you do not have to be in that situation to what difficulty to Tunnel about little bit longer though it is that a gold Garden Portland is on low Mana which couldn't hurt your bill to trade back but they want to wait another minute into the recall so they can get the f word on a Philly ocean with low manifold and with the cold lead for Bank sometimes that means EG gets to have Wave Control and head to make you recall awkward for FBI movie what kind of locked in a position where you're pushing and you have low Mana it's obviously very dangerous potential ganks can come in there okay you can see it that much better by was talking about an additional doran's ring on top of the dark still at they all have both actually based on to buy there so I will see you tomorrow to take and get this pushed out and read that as he's looking to not sure if she's doing it did actually get a freeze out there or not but you know that's a little bit. You know you talked about in traffic and reason that they're dropping His companion was actually often to deal with lysandra and also the ability to play in the side lane but this is what your kind of giving up right you're picking at the Port that almost worthless in this to be too you're not really going to be able to engage 4 it into the karma and you fellows did he try to run at this karma karma just Heather's you and walks away like you have Israel in the situation where it's almost 1:00 be to ask and you are going to be expecting this led to be to to be losing Flash Tickets to roots on both sides and Monta he's got to be careful he cannot fly traps first what not a bad trait on a 340 G to Zucca able to get them something something back there has been scaring went to the steel in a clever little usage of the Tom Kenshin of our over the walls we didn't have the flashback out he could have if he needed to but didn't actually have to pull that song or so golden Guardians do end up grabbing the dragon but they lose First Blood and they are going to lose at least a couple minions here for Demonte the fact that this is real that is supposed to be in the bruising to be to actually got that first what is a pretty big deal as well because that's going to set him up with very effectively since Darren did hop in but I tried it feel that it was way too healthy this might did come down early but no one for me he was in position that night to store forward from zukie allow that changed the land that's it for the easy skill shot their front Bang honestly Demonte should have just accepted his death at that point but wanted to try to flash those last go and see if you get out and pick up by Golden Guardians wave manicured well enough that FBI knew he can grab this way without too much difficulty even after taking the recall after going to the Drake from the lights a little bit and efficient to walk back to the future as well after shoving his own way and it blew his hand it off to Jesu queso both Portland to feel really comfortable IBC Bank love and having a little bit faster is well it is a CTA Mount Rushmore on clothes
