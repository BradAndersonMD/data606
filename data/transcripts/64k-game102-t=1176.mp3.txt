and if they could actually find a way to sweep through the playoffs by 3oh and every single opponent I would say that would actually make them the best na team ever in terms of a single twitch performance but we know their former players are actually on the other side and Evil Geniuses right now and that would be a whole bunch of Revenge if they were able to take down five 9 here Deputy really exciting to see how that one goes out of course we heard from coach the split report on cloud nine say I had a pretty good feeling on how Evil Geniuses it went like I expected I'm really confident e r v i can definitely beat my old teammates sirico to seem to Victory I mean to clap. Championship last time it was back in 2014 ever has been since it's been filed and populations but yeah 1701 regular season they look just the most dominant eye ever had and it starts to get the priest and Elliot vandeweghe Cloud9 we expect for them but they don't mean to get it yeah no big surprises as of yet in the band phase the Leblon fan is something I had my eyes on to take away from UK testing Dan and 70% of easy games against them one noticeably missing ban right now is Stendra it actually has it been a hugely prioritize can't fight either team but cloudy quite bought and they're just going to completely leave it up for now okay they say hey the most prized bottle enter here is vereist into enough worldwide Misfortune 10th to still be a bit more surprised but for the match of concern to put his valadares when he's played a lot of before at the Tampa gonna steal away from being there as well but it does mean we talk about talk with a Chance of these teams spent Aaron's gragas was used in their win last week as well so getting to play that again definitely be a power supply for EG yeah it's cool it's no surprise that he may say actually share a common view on what jungle is there both amazing Raga says they're both excellent Lee Sims so unless we see some type of new stuff from Lab Rats he did pull out on Nocturne jungle last week more likely though is will probably see a lease in front lever on side by side seems most likely they're having the pantheon that we might do that one come out as well as a highly prized jungler a truck in still locked at the answer to Lauren and then down there and that means we're going to wait and Speedy jungle and bid by later on this is actually very interesting most of the time with in the first phase of pics you'll see the rolls at least Matt but that's definitely not receiving here with the greatest I walked in and no jumper for cloud nine and if CG the MF is something that they're probably likely to lock in here just so they don't completely starving hailee carry pool okay it means we end up matching a little bit here on roads in winter but as you mentioned a mismatch jungler versus support at Rosie watch gun ESPN your heart you are when the game start just you and us we are together again and it means we get to Catholic he would have otherwise no difference anyway so we are covered your next prize jungle pick up pants and band off I mean I do find it interesting how Cloud9 was more likely to prioritize jungle are sorry Top Lane and bought Lanes animated jungle jungle full has been very large but blabber is a player who if you think about where can understand most of their experimentation pick ban it hasn't been the jungle it's basically to spend for the most part the leasing in the garage a show for him but I mean if there are there still Banning out so I'll Lane potential so it's very easy for him to fall back on cloud nine just seems like it was the correct Choice 49 to do with what do it today LED going to probably most likely safe counterpick Borges ukai in the midline absurdly aggressive player top charts in the first Blood C absolutely early game in a PVP sets that said Cloud that has a team of teams in the early game a very through the stupid Tramp as a car to pick to the Spindrift a job you mentioned earlier on despite not being incredibly popular for the a very common pairing with Misfortune they had two opportunities to ban the way they don't care about that they just care that UK doesn't get going if we think about the actual way to ease you would be able to win this game as if they can somehow unlock the UK so batting out as many powerful mid laners if they can and it completely sets up this Tinder pick it's completely Telegraph but it's also about it do I like this but not for this in there as well and I menu end of the day right it's you got a blind pick something sooner is one of the safer pics that get rid of his two most common assassins in the key on it and show us a third we know leblanc's with a gun here as well and I am curious if you look it does have a Nocturne which means you're not going to be an overly pressure against it and where is it going to go with this one kiddos were you able to play a little bit more aggressive if he has the Grog is pressure and also has that immense kill pressure at level six so that's one of the best pics you can do in to Sandra it's just extremely volatile because if you do start falling behind if you're unable to start contesting the wave it can go downhill very quickly and from the looks of it this is also just UK's first yossel play of the split so definitely getting pushed down a fair bit on champion pool from display have a lot of pressure and Nocturne typically not that strong super early so we'll see if that midlane pressure are we really do think bit late is going to be the primary focus of your gap for an easy win his net lease early through mid-game then splitting off on the side could look very good download yes oh great, so we don't expect a ton of early pressure from bladder on the Nocturne gragas probably can punish some of that early game weakness so I I really want to do that turns into I would love to see zouke really pop off but it is going to be a difficult effort if Cloud Nine's on today if they're playing at their level it's going to be a tough fight for EG yeah I mean we saw what the analysts as predicted everyone is predicting a sweep it is what we've seen C9 is 20 + 1 when you combine their first round of playoffs with a regular season record but if you think about the possible ways that you could win which is what kind of all I've thought about for the past week because you're trying to figure out if there's going to be drama here and it would be if they can make it to the 15-minute Mark with even gold against Cloud 9 has had the best first 15 minutes of basically any LCS team ever which does make me a little curious for this Nocturne pick because for the first six levels he's not really able to apply a huge amount of pressure he's mostly just looking to farm encounter jungle so well we'll definitely have eyes in the middle and I definitely tracking what flower does Early Autumn Nocturne all the teams are loading on the Restless take a look at the starting lineups hello and welcome to summoner's Rift it's game 1 of the Winner's bracket final Cloud Nine with 17 and one regular season type the best LPS record of all time people Geniuses stuck in a number 2 seed off the tiebreaker day a reasonably convincing win their first round bracket and this is a massive determine who is the first team to make the LPS 2020 spring finals Cloud 9 in blue EG and red vest and additionally this is extremely interesting just because fence Karen was on cloud nine last year actually won MVP and then three members of that cloud 9 team moved over to ege to eventually climb to be the second best team but here we go come on Spence Karen walk in and no one really wants to fight cuz knowledge doesn't exist and neither team has the whole Squad there and they don't get any little bit of Chip damage down sometimes I can matter little bit of damage can stick and make your Lenny face the slightest bit easier but in this case no harm no foul late invade him through for Vulcan bladder in Spanish they want to see if I can stop bracket starting a blue up would like to get the blue for his first cap and yes and I got a free much dedicated to this if it was going to do a state start at Wolves of his bladder can go to the blue steel in realistically blue will indeed be snowing here early game or the legal temp of Eros who like we would have been able to tell Trey that if we ended up seeing the actual fight I don't think it has a huge impact depending on what happens next in whatever Camp you clear first still gives you level 2 and the Grog s can also go for a fairly early recall either way I even seen thanks Karen what he's playing Are The Champions by panteon actually start wolves just by choice but it does give early-game dollars to see 9 and it limits the options expense Karen hasn't terms of early games which I think is pretty crucial knowing that the Nocturne does mostly want to wait until I was sick and nearly as well as put a trinket Ward down about the Krug camp and with since you're not able to take blue and it's drugs being ordered he's going to be on Vision pretty early on and they'll be able to track okay he's got 16 or 12 we know exactly what he sow topside okay this information has no licorice now nose needs to play around being tank top slide for now though he knows he has time to shut his went in and as soon as that Greg Xbox left you notes to play past with the real indicator of of what's happening is more so what C9 lanes are doing not necessarily that the garage is going to be put behind an auction in prison terms of farming Facebook Junger to take in for camp but the fact that the bottom one is able to push and they can do this because they know Spence Canada path topside after starting blue and it allows them more freedom to play aggressively do you make the first week I'll come through for the midline before too terribly long Misty shelves in the next Villanueva blocks down at the bottom side to help make sure that Scuttle is safe flea control for the drink it down as well but the man was getting a bit limited that can make a Lenny face a bit tough to do we have plenty of farm to catch going to go against her is nearby even say safest gear nearby as well go to spell shield but not disengage car wash out a little bit there's a lot of first-time offense Gary was with daring of flash there but nisky knew he had barrier the whole time very defensive summer spell choice on this end result has been scaring didn't fall for the bait and both people just kind of backed away knob lever and singing to fight over this Scuttle crab is enough to kill a top 12 on the bladder their grades. And yes for now he is totally up to Camp some of that it is worth waiting for more far as both genders have can't respond when you get some more gold picked up thought if to be so incredibly aggressive first trip like bacon and heads up to 1/2 early on yeah I mean you're seeing the early priority station from draft on Bears Tom kench paying off a little bit from seeing I hear without strong they've been able to do a lane and then also just the decision-making from blabber and I'm continually impressed with the way C9 can play these nocturnal early games because they haven't allow grata to apply any early pressure blabber was there the one spot svenskeren want to go to and they were able to get double Scuttle crabs because their bottom Lane and toppling report and because they got some deep words into Krug so just really well done early on to get blabber to level five so effortlessly and now getting that recall the challenging Smite so probably had six very soon probably around 6 minutes or 6:20 depending on how much experience he was able to grab from the lane and then they're going to be Off to the Races I'm pretty much every single Lane looks amazing top continually has pushed your getting licorice able to take a fee to get back to the Lane Sudbury items going to actually have extra money and life deal for an even even funnier mid-game there and we ready stop bottling what's up in a farm still are with more minutes to kill a good time as well try Extra Man in the back steps are so kind of already across-the-board Cloud 9 without a single pill or major objective on the map have a three to four hundred Gold Leaf come through for the first or the lady pays I have spikes and they're ready to go yeah they just have to watch out a little bit about this Path Lane moment for licorice because fence Karen has a spreader up and it's kind of snuck into the garage Aldi Burns to get 1/2 HP blocked Splendid Lane one cake work one game doesn't stop playing burn Crockett salt and also liquor to Splash but now since level won the fight he's moving to River fly to buy broken glasses with as well so that was down there but it's built
