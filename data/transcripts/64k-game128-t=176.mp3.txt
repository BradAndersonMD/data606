you double-crossed the boy and I think he makes a really good point in this is something you have to take into consideration both for him and spent there is that when you are on a better performing team you don't always have to do as risky as a flag which can sometimes you know turn out really early because you have more faith that your teenager going to carry you were going to make things happen and then. Maybe not having as much faith that they can play all the games in the same way that he would be able to do players fitting different roles right now but the ribbon respect given up here has been a fairly middling to to lower end topless hey you're with one band cool, said there was no time right that it says they have room Banna got them 75% of the time that is the most banned Champion against black West the next most man is actually grumbled at 42% so you're this guy just being on your team changes Piccadillymanaging of itself and that's kind of the point that fix over there so we are sitting on 6th wind 679 probably the most important thing Santa is kind of is the current has the coin where you are starting visit before item you're not actually farming the thing that is most interesting about it because we've seen a lot of different variations now around the world with Steve Rumble we have beads become more standard tanks or through using volibear Nautilus likely going to be the answer here I wanted you can do as the Nautilus alongside is fasting Santa is actually go AP Nautilus because you have more gold you can actually feel toward those items and we did actually see I think it was ignore play that kind of AP Nautilus style last week or the week before with it I think I wanna go on damage that it is not really a damaged. You put that some man and you're lying and azukita by the way is not looking for mates player he's the guy he's one is going to the bush I think that would be a bad cough for EEG for me so I'm kind of guessing you guys are don't really have a fun time Warren sometimes can be detected that rule because you have so much for looking damage with a little frog butt I am expecting that support Gen 4 ignore is the guy who is Ben still creative I really think as me to really big difference unique Championship played in this poor role so that's pretty cool too often and breakfast it feels like it is not really getting a lot done most of the time it's kind of even or behind in lane and barely able to find a lot of success in teamfights it's one of those things I think it's almost from talking with a lot of pro player its people are having their their opinions show shaped by scrims for the Champions where it really succeed in these kind of Scrappy game for fighting constantly improve play where people are more willing to kind of be more defensive and go down a couple of his often it's rarely finding as much access so you'll do well on it strong work ethic in purlear in the split but it just hasn't been a champion that I really seem to be very successful overall or at least call a doctor gets diapers are these two are here as well for himself by Band the pigs become a little bit less obvious will get locked in but already Nautilus Plus Pantheon a lot of geckos that since they're pretty powerful as far as when you're looking at Cross that place I would think that is so strong with that so what's that you're looking for these Global flavors in a consistent across the map and really make things happen and we have many sets of cops come in a couple times to get them know who played it a few weeks back good for the early game because you have to get into the back line you can't just like front or back on a slow gameplay it's happy on you need to be getting planks you need to be working really well at least court date in the gauges coming to be excited if they can let's go the charm should be blue how the pantheon stun Ms. I believe I got Reata couple years ago so who survived the matchup remember though it this could be deleted or Camptown is still don't know this is completely flexible I'm going to assume that they will sit on this to leave it does have pretty good Wayfair it is not as good at it happen at some time in the past I've got nerve quite a while ago and Ari is someone who you would expect to win that one do you want do if you can actually attacked the one the one keep the Aaliyah Lockton Lane you're moving a lot of her power to move around the map and try to make Plays with Stampy on 4th hasballah bust in 10.5 out of jungle is viable right now and it's really trying to do some funky phucstyx stuff for 35 HP you're not like anyone here but maybe next week tacky the re because it's done right into that seismic shove combo from Thalia and zero type damage can be arranged for that Pantheon to execute happen if we get ourselves into the game last I'll see if they would I say to know Academy Showcase in afterwards you got her number two team in the league flyquest is hear the Baked Bear market yet a 1/2 an evil genius his just outside of fly off but they can keep up with hundred seeds if they can pick up a win here been kind of loving the two teams banter back and forth on social media as well can fly Quest obviously go green initiative planting trees for victories EGT other socially to say they had cutting down a tree like that for book so they're both doing things for charity but kind of in their own ways which has been pretty fun to see them go back for it Lumberjacks be they can make it happen people he's so close to me this is actually the delay play either way for talk but they can play this is him being rude I was going down very bad spot Gangstar a bank or just for the gold that one with the? Being so this is this is actually a path we've seen before and and what are you trying to do you actually gone over this wall you come to this bush and you wait right there and then you try to invade behind that person but because they did so late in the game and because that's the entrance is almost always guarded by multiple people around you see that play made actually on top side but this is what it says about laying in bed where Greg is wash and we'll go over that wall wait for the cooldown then wrap around behind but it's a lot restaurant at bottom side is lot more members in the area and yes there was some unlucky timing is bandwidth walking right by as it happened so unfortunate start the air fan go to get to start with first blood will be pretty happy about that one small benefit for flyquest though is that thang and actually get to spend any of that gold Yakety Sax expected starting item set up here so it won't matter for the landing phase itself in foreign it would be easy to read to any blue and he's not going for a beer and something else is worth pointing out I always feel like I just I just find him and he's on there can be very effective against you going to have these slow Auto attacks like Senna also like gin know where it's about individual power off powerful I do a text instead of necessarily you know if constant dream of GPS so listen to track how ignorant does use that as it really can turn around a lot of all into the unit to find a hook on Turtle if the initial round of attacks from bank that's actually carried out by the sin that can really takes it gets level up at the camp was gone but if we three cancer red frosted his own walk to free up a Spencer and invade and that does do little something but it still needs a spanking to take a pot of scuttle if he will get the scuttlebutt they have pot lamb fries who's probably going to get it anyway looks like now to do if they weren't able to take away everything on the bottom side of filtrate goes off on topside so go to be pretty happy about that all things considered it is cleanse for power of evil says kind of just giving it back over to that combo that you can say 10 in French do with that Big John's done you kind of need to be able to cleanse at to dodge out from the inevitable seismic show that would be coming to Colorado if you're going to come through probably goes back to when I do to get more of that died for more that trade I should say is the way for us pushing towards labor so why don't you do as he has won all across the walls to chicken but he's keeping up with the Farm Bureau see if they can find any sort of angle to get to set up feels like it be a little bit obvious we just write it runs up but here we go not enough, survive running Flash The Flash The Flash The Flash felt like he might have had lethal damage they're actually do look for it and now it's is UK missing it's asking to be flyquest following they have to pack it up but they can actually re-entered wait around anyway nothing else that's the way it gets thinned out to say okay not enough time to die properly out we go to start and actually you're not comparing the Senate who is going to be playing at the board I done so already 10 plus the s in the advantage going to feeling pretty good about that and it does bring you much more of a true tank in that my mind because you normally look at this in a while you don't have to change and usually the detective work on a horse to do tanks that really rely upon having that stone play active and outside of that they're pretty squishy to be able to build a full tank items and largely I've been seeing what it is he thinks it worth playing along cuz that's antenna it's just a rush to word things like that man quite effective right now bank is able to feel pretty comfortable I got to point out of court GS400 Freeholder first blood but even subtracting that subtracting First Blood Billy's film 100 / ignore that we've been very efficient and using that Sickle and Demetropolis going towards but I'm assuming it's a very standard build of umbral glaze first that you're going to get that site so you going to be a complete an awesome board killer and still sleep Valatie but you can deal with these damn yeah there's just so much utility on that item not only revealing the word for allowing you to one hit them is actually a really big deal especially on that night we got slow all the way back or like how long they refill those texts were stolen Epsom salt as wild things are so predictable that helps friend Karen's favorite Auto attack knocks down the honey fruit good jobs for the pal what a bow with a buddy with a guy that's enough out of you all right you're on time out OK cell power evil pushing this one in just do cake going to be running back to laying here he has hit 6 and I have to start worrying about as you Kane Brown even more anytime he is off Vision you have to worry about the potential for Sally assault in obviously spent Caron still pretty far away from 6th and black on both sides could be looking to find the charm there's potential for that follow up from Sanborn and lethal damage but you'd have to be willing to either commit your flasher ultimate to start the fight often not even sure if they are still here yeah they're going to go to the flash charm to follow that up with all that lands he's just gone and this is a really good example of how to play around what was is attacking this level we actually saw this done excellently by to get them earlier today against C9 where you want to go for a shed great we're just going to be in Shands late you can tell to go to self so you're not going to be able to help yourself out in that way yourself will be fun to see if he if he does look for any sort of plays with that playing out of vision hear this was a lot of patients were flyquest actually was waiting for ignore to show up and then a three-man collapse been spotted they know he can't respond to this so last on its that charm connects the key was guaranteed would have had
