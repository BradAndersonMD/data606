on TSM he comes to Cloud 9 to the greatest sound bite it'll be different if they're good or not quite winning or whatever is it is working but we are finally now it's can't black and focus on these two teams here under these could be going up against Cloud 9 and I'm really excited to see if we're going to have any more equipment pick up this far as picking been on any kind of interesting things coming out Garvin has been I think one of the big go to do for medial is very popular jungle throughout the league but there are some players who really highly prized this pic above the leaves in the fall of the gragas is no other world which I think it it kind ofHP Z2 play noise you're going into it, didn't like in stages it does have the Brewer game start making power but is that the playmaking 2 pencil I think all the jargon is much lower than that of aggregate or at least having that trade out there right absolutely must give it does come through with the final picks for second base with bands right now it's about 9 o clock in their final Champion then there's to leave him a really kind of cutting your bladder before at least sodium and a waste of his third least in game being in the leak Walter and I just like super early stats are always a little extra because like well yes two of the six twins are on their personality credible undefeated how could you not Bandits ribbon every time through pick a champion todayhas been great on late then a lot of fun I think to see him have you know clearly a starting position and there is not going to be this walking back and forth our or anything that we have seen or heard about the fibers going to get it jotted being a full-time starter for a bit but what if he can continue to perform well a lot of Martin being parted out now here in the band 459 they have already grabbed Dennis Devinney outlawed the priority one solution almost always on the band tables the first round will there be any outside of any Affiliates I would immediately think of something along the lines of Misfortune that is quite popular still in the middle of these days considered very good cleaner has a white cross as well but that being said you're then go to be having to pick and then Fortune into Nautilus Leaf Endive and that can be something that is very Troublesome for mmatorch and who doesn't have a dad in trouble to say State than this is kind of goes bad to worse when you have concealed in there there's so many Die buddies put into the DMS locked inwhat the players are playing a whole lot of I asked you wouldn't know if I would have kept my eye out from work on it as it comes out I want to have a wedding Lane. But now it's actually very support heavy line up your efforts Cloud 9 if not before then on Seneca and put out some dance what is generally a more supportive scampi and Morgana obviously the same as super good and he's very good in the leblancs matchup have to bury song interactive you have incredibly strong way up there with the w Max was almost always what he will go for in that bit Lane once you get a handful of levels you can really start have LeBlanc pushy and under the current it will block this door or answer that with the binding you have the Black Shield you actually immune the roof coming out from the chains there and you are going to be in a very powerful at supporting and protecting the senate or even the Camille who's going to be able to kind offorward it to be very vulnerable to Champions like Leona but when you have this Morgana with the super powerful blackfield amped Up by all the AP later in the game well it becomes very difficult actually break that for a Leona then you're becoming dependent upon who will want getting back there too and that could be really tough another game or are you being a little a very frequently you'll see a blue side draft you just go jungle baat Lane in 1 2 3 and then traded kind of extra counter Pitkin and you go there a power PICC wise you have to assume you just look so pretty tonight I really like the draft for C9 that being said I do think it is low on consistent damage if you have a poorly game you can sometimesrun over with the type of compositions we're all of a sudden you're just not actually putting out enough damage to birth people down things like a truck and Leona and as well as Darvin flying for it can be very problematic for you know this and it's actually really kind of work your way through ya also worth noting that is going to be a dark Harvest almost exclusively glacial augment that is mostly about know that kind of stacking up of the souls in Auto into a cue for that to hit combo dark dark Harvest is hired damage of course but you do have to trade aggressively to really get a lot out of it because a low stack dark harvest in actually adding must damage later on in the game so we'll see if they are going to be training more aggressively playing more aggressively as a result of the number to try to really get a lot out of itI know last time we saw the dark Harvest it had I think to harvest acts like 25 ish minutes which means the Keystone as usual it'll be twice not the most strong but you know you mentioned the TV. Harvest can help just a little bit in in getting to that difficulty exactly a double sweeper start so they actually use this key sweeper just to have that sidelined Ward's then they sweep all the way in here provoking and they know this has not been spotted it may be sucked out simply because of where that First Weber was used but pretty much things they do spot Vulcan has been coming back the lane so they are going to exactly what's going on now just based on the direction of they actually came through media will run straight to the red buff N Out of these did get to shove in that bot Lane so it is going to be some CS lamp after a fight right here in this confined a binding maybe it's a slow walks away chords Keep mine glacial more dogs than the Autotext Logan set up also has not seen going into this Red Sox he jumped over the wall to eatWard's get the bypass all in the Bible tells about his gun was hoping it was going to be a little bit slower had me is gone say Ludacris to read you would have actually gotten there in time to to stop that and get that free bus start but because meteos knew what was going on Branch Shreveport he is able to grab the owners Red Bluff and stay even as far as those go the little park right there again this you just pushing up a little bit and finding some room for her ass drop his first yeah good bit of damage did the W cooldown is is going to be read that for every tick on cannons as well as Champion so you're saying that he's trying to place that but it is always on the Canon if you're not going to be able to hit the blunt keep you cool down low and maintain the bush also worth mentioning that is glacial augment on the Morgana to this is going to be the Super Soaker spooky ghost type set up that is going to help with their engage I'll be able to scout out opponents be able to slow them down for pencil Nautilus or lease in engage or even for that follow up from Zen for now slightly defenses go and get the black shield on three of the probably correct match going to fight you in a dark enough to knock you down the first, get rid of wax seal so he should be depressed if there we go back though and if he was afraid that's where a lot of the damage is and that's also where that route is going to come through. So be able to me in that pretty big deal it also has felt like so much of this of the game really has been about switching lanes can you have a cat party in your lane be able to shove and allow your jungler to get access to think of Rick Dale to get things packed his things like that Dragon and Morgana is really going to excel in that regard and it's just not much that LeBlanc can actually do to come out waveclear Morgana right now we go and look at games they once again lead to Cloud 9 size of that is pushing waves have not yet been a difference up in the top link Without End there in about looking pretty solid here so you got to stay good starting to Cloud 9 as this way to switch them down here has been in book and Doin just fine I'm waiting I'm waiting for for Cody and and yeah it was a nice start though from the Hundred Years by line as far as they actually kind of got that really recall off they pushed in their bonus. At least I went back to base double Doran already purchased up here for Cody Sun directly stacking really effective on a map it is one of the Champions that I talked about no can be somewhat vulnerable to all in this is something that helps alleviate that not only through the effectiveness of all the lights the only way you're getting a lot of flat HP that can help you survive against early all ins when you are going to 34 Dorrance played as a lot of Emmett layers like to go all that far in this game but yes can I have a lot of found this one receipt for Vitiligo funny damage from Midland going but do you recall break out the arrest of corrupting potion the door and rang and the extra fairy Toppers Amanda game yeah I just five minutes in the dragon of the life and you might see that attempt for the very early Phil about drink for the lady face if they are fighting video of horse flies bite their first football game will be there first to right now that that is going to the key there that they would have that extra man and he was still pretty close but yeah I'm just relating we should be people kind of gorilas you feed and then just tell that off later on. It's going to be the same idea here really don't see the one for me to go over the reports. Not going to make it happen but videos on that control working to make it not happen here and now that's the bottom Tyler going to find a sun towards then tries to walk away but he's revealed he's not going to get the passport photo lab and persuaded claim that was supposed to turn to run fuel comes in Cuba and seconds are cameras picked up their damn is working out really well played by disengage the send another hook comes in and I was going to be a route on a Cody Sun the follow-through maybe is there is something going to run a little helper full can I get some shots as well no follow-through available now if they go low Health part sew a very low healthbars them but you and ignite so both were able to refund off eyes then which is really important in the early all in where can I can make up a large spinach without damage you have to be very careful because she's dagger those abilities so you know he cleanses the sun would know them immediately after then get the most out of the family right well it's all about and Drake does come through for bladder has one more time they got the pass through to you a little bit of a junktown on his van B is on the side and he goes down if you both signed off as I pointed out and been able to just walk it out that cleanse really paying dividend the great roof Doug connect onto videos and blabber with easy follow-up is was not able to get into the next to try to take that you for his jungler though First Blood they're over to Cloud 9 and now it's that is silly yeah I mean, I think it's a level 1 Black Shield at this point that's a nice piece to inexperience on the champion if you think a level one blackfield is going to be able to prevent infirmity erupting that combo right like that is easily going to break your black heels and then the game will just go through but it's not going to really mean to too much but it is Hunter Tuesday Kansas pastor's wife year do you like him that good wave foot for them happen they are on this Rift Herald Labyrinth around do does have fight does have the opening the door for Medias picking up that's what I can fly with a safety but now the re-engagement coming across licorice 1/2 from McCalla over the stock is gone and you're comes to re-engage the kicks last text to Karen and some days either. Donde yeah they get 2 kills there for the rift Herald good a job 500 East directions to cure that to make sure that wasn't able to steal this away but still pretty costly little Adventure there for them as they are going to lose that not till 6 the flag and videos which I believe Reds like it's the rest of the damage fix it up one of the boyfriend of Thieves trade back pretty big they do still lose that blue buff I believe but there are at least able to get a kill back for themselves and we'll see how much can they get with this riff because that is a pretty big investment you lost multiple lives going for it and you lost out of control of mid lane and you are pretty far down is gold at your hundred he's right now but I really had to work out what kind of hang on in this game flapper goes in with the Q Plus Mike let's see where it goes down to volume just a little bit earlier Barbara wasn't able to get his off so Grace might they're from videos but then over talk to give him to Stacy to actually do stuff and then it's a great kid flash sectioning off the odd man out if somebody was off to the side in the way from the team to a couple kills do go see nice way and they're up pretty significant amount of gold here at 10 alrighty 1800 gold and about Drake which is I would argue that it is better than infernal in almost any comps as one of them so if you're what's a nautilus in front of you don't care about getting 680 in like one of those about 80 armor and fortitude
