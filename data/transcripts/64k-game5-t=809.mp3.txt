there by headed out passes let's get into the actual games where you have to deliver every game now does count towards International games as well look into be Representatives every team striving to be number one at the beginning I do want to delve into a little bit of black West do because as much as you want to give a pass to the team liquid games you have to observe what actually went on in these games it's not just who won who lost who is your opponent and getting free passes that way there were definitely a lot of problems with the bottom Lane I think Johnson previously when he showed a lot of progress on dignitas benefited from aphromoo being there his leadership is mentorship in the bottom land and when you put in another new player Diamond no coming up from Cloud 9 Academy in the bottom side they did have some directional issues finding V bandeau for the jungle focus on this side you would put Thalia if you were going to go for the Tilley at the jungle combo pack for Europe banned from previous to lock in booty or might jump up though and take his place as that's been kind of a sweeping skip across all Regent 11.23 km in a couple of days ago the nurse the pantheon and boujee or are not in this past are still too friendly talk to your jugular that are likely to get taken away is ready for the pantheon Band Time taken away for flyquest do indeed get rid of food You're So triple Jungle Band against speaker by the way I would argue at Worlds maybe are you a pretty great and just went through jungle bathroom still gets an incredibly strong jumbler in Tulia open do Lilia Jose the audio that's what it's like West Winds in Walking tournament on that plus you have the opportunity for you know things like Graves I very much doubt Fiddlesticks which Shuffle up early on the cookout on W got nerfed which made it significantly more difficult with a real seraphine bottom land lock in do likewise already showing that they are probably going to have seraphine carry down on the bottom side like we're talking about for Johnson and Diamond as being a pain point for this flyquest lineup that that lane is is quite safe for yourself you don't have to have to overextend fretless very good at going for set up to you when you can call your jungler so basically this Lane is it kind of baby proof for the bottom line in my opinion you just wait until they come and then you got a crazy initiation Trail setting up for seraphine login for Windows to Champs are Level 6 that is crowd control calor is globally competitive play Serafin fought at the carry is as common as Serafina at the mid laner she is truly a flex pick she is you can play free rolls most awfully hard to Fort 4th of not the case but that is an option is open for these teams I don't want anyone to get likes it going to be like it is only going to be down at bottling because that is definitely not true regardless we got a syndra coming through for po we at you know you're taking over beers call Mark here in your opening regular-season game for the bot Lane should be pretty good handle property tax with a well with the ultimate of course and autopista en Des Champions ofac to be a good look are playing a jury go forward relied Jose get a composition for the acronym dive heck road going to come down and look for those skills he brings the damage I actually like this direction of a strategy for flyquest Jose coming in definitely one of the strongest players beer for the squad and setting him up with confidence with a heck room while jungle is in the state that it's in right now where you can be a true carry definitely like this a lot to use I'm going to have to start thinking about how to engage actually been out one of their own possible choices there with a Leo probably because you know what star and syndra it's too much to see there's there's really nowhere to fit in but there are other things that you could look you for Connor engage a lot of them are actually AP heavy though so this does make it a little bit more difficult 40th Ave can't do anything like Swain broadcast also AP those are some of the super common once yeah cuz as soon as sacrifice merch Reds and real by the nurse provide to 18% and stops play quirks I just seen the attack damage obligate Champions are the ones that live in Spanaway Serafina uw's like every single one of their feasibilities how old is that you can still be fine after the CDC consider I feel like Gangplank for honey because they need more attack damage threat it has good counter gauge options with lots of Zone control in AOE as well and it's one who needs best champion and he's been one of the players that has been struggling 40s and if lock-in tournament with any indicator looks like licorice going to beat him to the toppling punch stow and go for the Camille if you're going to Pick n Plankinton Camille heck Grump you better if you watch it out and they chose to wait on Midland Tech course they know they were against Indra she typically good at the Oriana but Oregon if it's the cops so that's kind of the race and therefore Palafox but it said you know who he might take the Camilo I want to make sure you lock Us in for ourselves more board knows you'll never take her Oriana a way we can get that last pic if it's likely the game did you call that one out definitely going to be a strong one here to hold on against these. I'm here I'm glad that you mention your possible counter games on bottom side Sword Art the 5 million dollar sign up for TSA is on Alistar this is literally my favorite Champion I've ever seen Sword Art play when he's on flash for Sony. International Event on the Alistar planking around through anime jungle controlling vision for the team having set up a shock collar for the squad you want him on a playmaking champion that's definitely a very viable strategy for TSM to go to games like ultimate Tulia ultimate down there to wallum off make sure you can try and get some kills and actually punished why do flyquest weakest areas and I want to point out real quick I love this so much as sort out was walking last champion keepkey clickteam o senta Misfortune Misfortune TSM TSM Block in the MF it warms my heart so much just like seeing Thea sent me, is indeed the midline or hear it means Camille and heck room or the physical damage for flyquest plenty of math games coming out of Oriana and sarafine as well we usually see Moonstone seraphine though I'm still partial to Leann trees. The Field Museum Pro play together and if lost in play for in a fact that he is not be primary Chapin engaged upon that over-the-top is going to look really good I mean they they do have really really big areas if they can control if you can make it work with the stun from cindra and the sons from I'll start with your knocked up so it's going to be an exciting one here clear top side carry for flyquest with the jungle hecarim and topside Camille So taut triangle of the map has to be very important to them maybe we even see some level ones trying to set up for deeper vision NSI you don't have for the jungle so that speaker doesn't put a wrench in those plants at its peak has been one of the most active jungle is that we have had in the LCS very very proactive has really been outstanding super super strong jungler Gladius and finally figured out that I want to play with I think this guy could be on the roster for 4 years and years and years and truly be a Cornerstone player in the NFL a sad before chance like I had to give her the best performing player of TSM for the last four months right now counting World's End of the early 2021 season I think he's really been phenomenal looking forward to what he could do on this first pick to Leah next weekend but he'll find something else to be on because he is very very good and I want to see how much the wrestlers roster comes together it's TSM with with 40 players it's Pica in a whole new roster around him and you know so far they had a quarter Final Exit they lost a cloud 9 the first round of the lock in playoffs and and that was the end of the season and we got to wait and see what they can you know waiting for for the beginning of 2021 for the regular season and in the homes are rebuilt their roster as well that we're all going for game 1 of LCS 2021 DSM are also an organization that always have kind of one eye looking off into the Distance chords International success part of the reason that they have done this multiple times with Aaron invest a lot to pick up a shock collar for the team Sword Art definitely the most accomplished of any of those attempts that they have they tried to go with you know I'm coming straight off of a World Finals but with every game now that the LCS is actually started poster walk-in counting towards those International Events sports qualification to representing North America these are the ones where they're really going to lay it all out on the line let's see what both teams have learned I from the early stages looks like a scoby bottom side start for both of them heading up towards the possible Gangplank matchup okay yep Jean Blues on the bottom side means I'm going to end up topside at 3 minutes and then I'll be over looking at right now unless you have Shenanigans you'd be like at 3 Camp in the bottling clear which is unlikely but I guess possible jungle start their for Jose do y'all do going to get the heavy leishman's do Elaine Johnson going to hold onto his devil cast once that four-lane pressure so the very mediocre sarafian Auto attacks of the only addition he's going to provide several do for lost in Sword Art put it in their own autos and hitting the sosta lane a sequel Pine sacrum the strongest level one tank doesn't get to provide a whole lot so going to play mostly on the back foot cure TSM by lost let down his want to get him anything yet now I want to talk a little bit out who needs Gangplank specifically because there's a reason I was banned so much against him when he was in his prime and there's a big difference between you know some of the other LCS King points that we've seen not play aggressively early on with his champion I love gangplanks early level one power booty always tries to make use of his trial by fire that passive at level one does so much for you so he sets up barrels in the brush to try and use to refresh his passive constantly goes to stack of his grasp rocks then we'll shoot off at just as you see here thank U observers he gets the Q Plus then he gets another explosion they're so nice job I him start our clothes for a smaller gauge trade on bottom side though some decent damage but there's no something on a diamond so does it mean at on Lost takes a look at a poke but there's going to keep healing on backup Johnson by the way is doing Arie and not Guardian so if he started he be much safer against getting dope because you can put a shield on and then battle allowed guarding the trigger next to me takes damage and and that would help him quite a bit with him a little list quick way for your power of evil 24 out of 25 bottles he has very very good and needs to watch peaky take down the Scuttle and Takis recall and so it should be here for Jose down to bottom say hi to try and get there you know for the for the respond to his craw PCS that the Alistar laying here for TSM has control of jungle so we can just walk straight across mid and pick up the double Scuttle crab for himself on this to Leah and is why you skip your cruggs on Tulio he just goes red into Raptors up towards his topside pushing match up there with him and is able to pull off the double Scott oh crap here he just heading straight to his response prompt you don't actually lose out a lot of time and misses him taking into account is Les matchups I get the 4 reset off right into you are the early attack damage picking up his longsword and is therefore the respawn of the crop you want to try and get your level six your forehead from he's one of the central carry points for this match up as we said in champ select the heck rum the Camille the big hairy power here for flyquest bottomland very CC heavy looking for more supportive plays we see multiple Realms coming out as a sword art just made one up towards mid now diamonds following but they did have some Vision pre-existing here for TSM that's what I lay down on his first half of the ALCS throughout the entire year you can see the link down below twitch.tv / flyquest if you want to keep track of that and watch in not English you know they're the Run of that one so he's going to meet with speaker right now and a season start that he's in peace out not much you can do here since six Liquors just recalled he's got teleport available can join but Palafox burning that flash with a pass from sword art is actually really big as Oriana already has to worry about kill combinations Wentz injury hits level 6 dangerous spot his wave is pushing up towards the enemy position plus he has no flash for himself if he always looking at level 6 the only reason he still aggressively push it like this and it's going to be able to get this wave in is because he has the double control works on both sides so he knows even though powerview lancets time there's no kill threat coming through here and it's going to be up to sort are in TSM to try and clear out some of this Vision to really take advantage of the flashes orellana Diamond sets up near the bed and they look for kanakuk not going to find it there a speaker shows up to help with the war clear who any waiting on the shield then landed the Q good time either on the Gangplank but overall they recently licorice was slain by a lot 5 PS is more than once in the slaves we still can be pretty comfortable over-there as his being recalled come through DSM 6 minutes and I'm going to still look at bottom Scuttle and maybe a chance at an early dragon as we can bring the spy and says that if I'm out I'm still going to keep talking up there early start shoes dones with PVP damage up quite a lot to me
