when when you hear that Mooney get signed to a team people start to think old man is I are they going to stop them out now then they're going to have to move a lot of stuff around but, I really stepped up that far in the ALCS to the draft Point EG and Azucar specifically all their losses they've been the clangour games that have been the kassadin vs. Cloud9 be of the karma that's not going to work out most recently the kog'maw game which cannot go split push very little Mobility champion and people are starting to really constrict their view on Suzuki and what he can do as a player and what the overall team should then do as far as their game plan coming into camp in selecting haven't yet. I think deeply the second or third best team of the spring split and know that was off the back of them being a very explosive very aggressive and then when it came inexceptionally well but it was a bunch of stuff you have pressure out of the midline now either for the first 12 minutes the game and stick Lasik Arma game we're okay yes he has to put pressure but he can't be explosive very much in the early game and you're waiting to scale for rent to Ultimate and and so they're trying those Styles and I think early in summer is the time to try those files I will always accept it to trying to Branch out because the topic do Lake playoffs that's going to be really comfortable for a team as good as eg3 lost because of those profile so when is it go back to Old standards Old Faithful maybe it's all right what they lock in a little piece of old baseball with is very good scaling Frontline very good scaling and back Ryan a classical belly first round on a red tideare we see so many teams do it over summer split what are Mortals going to look at a little bit more playmaking I like always trying to go this route into NFL Leo stronda opening when you get here at least in Naples Lee sin or a Naples Xfinity to go try and create a lot of those pics earlier in the game and basically our goal is what you're saying I'm going to try and create a play get a kill then I take the objective trying to lose the one who grind-it-out place off of you know a winning lane or something and focuses on Hilti TE a little bit more but listen and rakan double walk-in is so much more we need to find our pick we need to find our kills first then we'll go pick up the objective afterwards and look it up Priority on getting it to Moana Boulevard as soon as possible and all we got. Side we are ready to go for going to like his back if you're against the lure of whoMatt is going to be on tanked that's okay to play the game out but also means all right could you do focus on support bands work on always worried about tankier engage support breast also to me is one of the really good ones I always talk about it but seems like people Bentley on a nautilus more often but I'm always happy to play thrash into it take the school matchup I love when you see a good threats player interrupt work on with the plays and then hit you hit him with a sentence while they're trying to jump back to their carries in a straight line so I would vote for that little bit more skill intensive but I know so many people just love going with the not cuz it's that either point-and-click and obviously you just have the auto spell to be strong and they're so V tried-and-true Allura malphite is available it will not be able to come around convair did Mortals very easily could have went to play another organic opposition so it will push Infinity down his Zoe is still up with a new pic for him a Laura the weather Champions that he's super well-known rappers time in academy I do like it through the top sides and more Tanki auctions kind of grinding you down or got got to bust a couple of batches ago pretty far in the past but nobody else really picked it up you see sometimes like some spot games from with or something in the NL East the other other players that really like the champion in and enjoy the notes in my thinking is of it but like you said I have really liked his orianna play this far turn up Sports super well on State and now he's got a chance on. You know one of the most iconic carry Champs in League of Legends I like to come to the boat slice your Evil Geniuses are going again for a fairly standard teamfight base composition now I will say to do K is good on damaged Focus team Fighters his Corky game right that was the very first for the game of the slip for them right when they dismantled CLG very very hard on their first games we can play the backbone is really well I'd like to become a champion with some agency in the Oriana can be the big playmaker can go for Flash shock waves and what not as needed so I think this fits him very very well I still think neeg comp that backed up with solid team fighting bangers on a filios they've obviously got a solid front line here with it was a trundle with the vole a bear with a nautilus in the Corky start the workout help it out. Phil's well-rounded it feels good for what I got to go to do the Block band away means you got to play something more standard and it's going to look for the solid have looked pretty good on his light up they played some top teams very very close and I'm excited. Come out I mean they've they've put the 50 roster back in Apollo with hockey well and then the the rookie solo Lane kind of flavor it's it's been a bit of a Revival for for the team and end for the Brandon and people cheering for them again as underdogs the definitely still under dog's going to get CG here as this EG draft we've talked about having kind of a check list of approved azuki Champions and it definitely does does check that box so they are aware they are within the bounds and setting themselves up for success of course we know now that second place we got two squads up there tide at 6 into EG cannot reach that Mark at the end of the first round Roberts they will have to sit around for Thor so even if they went out until they get three matches I could pull those things down with them and it got a lot of that is been experimenting it feels like a certain degree and an easier still exceptionally strong team that I think they're still why the favorites to go to do very well maybe go to Worlds things like that we get the cops to the bottom of screen here as well and I do hold out hope for a more get the interview before you know where he's talking about well we can probably make playoffs do it but I think Mortals are our maybe the fifth or sixth place team I think this is about where I would pick this team so far you kind of threw out the first four games look at the ones they played so far and Andy's Games book 1 of all this team looks looks pretty solid and we'll see what they can get here we are still in some competitive Integrity right now so we can further dive into the Champion Select while we have some time again I talked about as soon as they were pics but I love this this type of jungle match up where you're staying right here is the initiative. Here's the ball take this ball in the early game let's see what kind of plays you can create and him and hakuho do have one of the above average support in Jungle a time spent together I would choose jungle support proximity stats this is this a match made in heaven with the most mobile Champs in the game I always love to see when they can make those jumps and play off of each other to catch someone out of position and so you look for these important timing Windows when bottom gets there first week off or they support almost all the time to head straight up Midland so they have options of going to either side of the map before we're looking to to place their Wards with their jungler sometimes they can you know go offensively try and get gullane and you and her got Lane is one of those so those types of time and where you're looking at a couple of these backs are or what we're going to keep our eyes on realistic leave you was well aside from posting Volver who can Ulta wait a little bit The Immortals jungle support power Duo I think have a lot of very good targets and these kids can absolutely come through so I am very curious to see how that we can play on coming into the week Jaco and expect the lead the entire league in Kill precipitation over all that they were they were best of the entire league those two had done so much. lifting gear for more than a year to other very very best players in and I think they're going to look really solid now we did have to remake the game at Smithy I believe he love the game which means we have to rebuild the delay so for all that stuff we are going to go to a store commercial break when we come back though meet us here for a little bit hello and welcome back to the show we are getting into the game before too terribly long you got our faces for about 2 minutes and then some of those ripped floor plates Champions and Summoner icons in the whole the whole kit and caboodle
