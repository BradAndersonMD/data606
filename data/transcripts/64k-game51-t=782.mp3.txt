Deanne flyquest here hoping that this one is going to be closer than the previous I got to say looks like bark C I also would have sent toward best jungler in the LCS to split this man is absolutely incredible. Wayne Odyssey top four or five is really stacked with hard to say but really hot really good players all around here honestly I mean it's definitely easier this this year as Mark was alluding to to say that someone got robbed in every single position selectos because it's really important for this matchup specifically obviously everybody always focuses on hunie as a very chant to lek Reliant play as he has had some very bad game off of his main Champions Rumble Gangplank but also for flyquest they bring some interesting thing is really high tendency toward rakan they areare the teams that more aggressively used those IR Con in a world where the 80 carat pool has been whittled down more not going to be the case here because Caitlin is left up obviously number one pick right now with the extra range and ever since she got her attack damage and health boost she's just such a price of one that they always put your lane Pokemon your Tower Whittle away at those Tower placed and Kobe I think it is a new patch it started this round of playoffs and right now among sort of top regions like read about not ask you do group said that major event only the LPL in the LPS have played yet know very small sample of what other teams think is good off of times LCS insulator to a patch that we can watch your a play a whole week for example for coming into the champ select kind of blind not the one other thing as good as I got to work todaythe LPS only care about the champion over in China for example of course more Konica filling out an entire bracket because the proteins themselves stay on a later patch for much longer and it takes longer for them to update to 1016 definitely a lot of credit to Demonte if you're picking up sticks so quickly maybe we'll see something new here so far nothing new koala bear is actually one of the ones that got nerfed pretty hard I really have been lamenting the movie Speed Nerf bat Volver. I kind of dropped him from my personal roster but it is still a flex Pick 4 so I expected to be in the hands of Santorum though he's done great things so far they split with the championa lot of early game presents you can get in there even without the speed still very valuable with your single Target sign in the first image that you can put out early on vulva bear is that he is only a jongleur now that he's been there Farm enough that I think there's just enough other better top winners bad to flex stick isn't reliable enough that you just talk later end of the day but of course that's just it up there what's a little size are the flags supposed to be exercising for CG right now just throwing top 10 Ben 10 banned by the way they also believe that the volunteers at 5 to take right and it remains to be seen as well that's like throwing their bands off at Uni Graves arguably the king of the jungle with the nurse new set and we'll be coming through as well throw a benefit our people for the Corky instead and that means as a kind of picked you Pee Wee's Oriana last time these teams played Evil Geniuses through four band at Power of evil and then he still picks Corky and they tracked them sothey actually forego all the other four pants and they're just painting the Corky it just checking around here versus there toward possibly then setting up for another as your pic or something like that for gold options I personally still really like his doughy I'm also a very good Blind Pig mid there but honestly the top three blind pigs Oriana azir Zoe these easy things are all available for him I thought this up to what style of game they want to play well look at the style that they want to play it might be around Top Lane split push keep in mind you still break even know who he didn't have the best meal game last time I suppose competition we've got the dalio in the midline and golden is here to help someone died visits aren't things out of your lineup against Callie from golden blue looks like it's going to bedefinitely likely it's going to be in this way comes out here for flyquest these are after the changes to wear but made a few changes to the damage or you're going to get more do more damage Pastor Jeff seems like the coolest lowers to get more damage and of course the W range is something like 4,000 you could walk through the brush next to your lane and you'll be in late in spirit hecarim I think it's for the best champion in League of Legends and play Dempsey's Evil Geniuses I think can take over this game on neck ropes with the galley over-the-top and specifically freak it's not justBlind Pig hecarim hear what you said because hecarim best Ketone is either conquer or phase recipes with mostly more for the jungle 5 expecting who need to go conquer you can stack up the helicopter cues on shed just keep on spinning on him with your conquerors backing up and you don't have to worry as much about the spirit Spirits refuse the auto attack of blocking W-4 shed and heparin can utilize the Moose. Lee well to dodge taunt it's a big part of shen trying to get trades on you if you dodge the time if you if he doesn't want that means he probably can't get his cue pass through which takes so much of the damage out of a sense trading out of the very least shun can try to block devastating charge which is a decent chunk of the birthday Matt there in the heck is well put ya que is just your spin it around and and that's not getting blocked by Doug Stone very very strong Champion now headed to the acronym people do run ignite up in the Top Lane because you can just use your old or you eating away from gangsterhave to run flash or even ghosts are you can just run more damage and kill Champions off Jen's going to build armor natively he's going to build some durability there that the health of Titanic Hydra and Sunfire cape look he can cut it with Stan but this is going to feel very high crime favorite I like this it allows to UNI to play very very heavily in a side length but he comes down it's hardened gauges not you know the squishy Camille who like hope she can sit in the old enough to kill someone off Hector is going to get in there he's going to get a bunch of durability the big tanks. For ekrem is his W-2 at the heels are so it takes damage around him heels for four like 30% of the damage dealt which means he will drain take off your team coming in after you a champion to look like a lot of fun and with two of the core items Trinity force and Destiny ants when you get your desk dancing you are one of those Juggernaut lifesteal tanking types of Champions in addition to the W makes him very sustained oriented so Grievous wounds are pretty important vs. champion especially later on once a distance is completed absolutelyprobably 10 minutes or so far since the bus East Falls awfully like 30 you kind of Spike on your first two and then he's already W like the regular sub isn't very good and so they like ultralight gave you're not 600 Camille you don't like that that kind of falls off of it but your first 20 minutes going to feel amazing when he's definitely a classic Trinity Force spiking Champion we have a little bit of delay with a game that's why I were waiting right now but honestly I really curious to because hecarim of the other things that you have super long range where you can stop Shin Stand United not only do you have your move speed boost With Yuri which was bust at the top end but also a super long range with your ultimate and your ultimate provides an extended fearnow the longer that you travel with it that actually got bucked at the maximum range so you can go interrupt the shed Stand United and then unlike a lot ofChampions that might die you know under Tower of the send turns around and taunts them I can kick it out while the sun is is still feared from from his own ultimate so it's not as dangerous going for deep inner up well going to be a lot of fun the games begin and champions like is complete. The jump a T-Rex playoff series is flyquest it once again faces off against Evil Geniuseshello and welcome back to the Series game 1 of estify between flyquest and Evil Geniuses these teams are two Best of Both Worlds if you win here today anyways next weekend against Team Liquid or cloud nine that is a spot at the 2020 World Championship now the heavy favorites here against TG most because I have seen Heaven 3-0 and their favorite however I have faith in the heck room I have faith and go to the recipe for geniuses to be exciting game and I know freak you just have this infatuation you love this Champion I definitely like it as well especially now it's so cute but I think that other interesting side of it is on like Westside this Wayne did this is kind of a ridiculous that has not been seenyou know since the sensory worker needed before the rework or a before this mini rework whatever you want to call it and it was extremely rare so I'm super excited to see what part of people can do with this Champion the main thing I know about playing with it was actually when I was doing with my boy big Terry former talk about support and he was just like okay main thing is when he comes to try and use a coupon you to snare you actually walk forward him to it yes he will take the damage but that's the snare only stance the last thing hit if you play in the minions and walk up into the minions and it just stares the minions and you can get off a better grade as galio you can probably use that moving get your queue on the minions as well as for Here solo course running with grass tear in the later to get some help back but overallwhat is mostly Straits will say hecarim can run out of Mana he's got he's a fairly Mana hungry Champions but obviously you can do runes on ization get through some of that one at WGU link happen if things are monsters but it's still a good I think it's kinda help that rank one so good to stay in there regardless and Hulu shows in the wave gets out of the 12 CS then we'll see how well still looking last hit under turret I did some looking at so what you went right. Swain is the third worst matchup in all of the gov Legends for Midland galio based on win rate of the other ones would be Nocturne and set that was banned so there you goand I just looked up season 10 it looks like only Mickey and whippo for LEC in Spring where the two Twain plays so none in summer does far and how people would be the first to receive a cake I said it already has not matter what you try for three minutes waiting is Off to the Racesdown hoody is running out of resources here has a biscuit if he needs it can finish the shove but looks like receiving pretty early TV back to land in the second is heat races help are out for a mini Bush and yours a bank yeah we get the POV from San Torrance right through the brush fire of evil set that up there's no chance for goldenglue to flash anyting what I was talking about earlier with the Q staring the last thing that it hit go to go try to run away from it as the tip of it hit for power of evil he pulls them right back in before goldenglue can get out of there Flash in from santorin that is great no CC layering from this jungle Duo and it really worked well together to get black box where they are today a little right place right time for centaurion See Is Gold and blue and fence guard when I get to his side of the jungle look sad don't you dare they want they're going to back up their Lanes but at least thinking about for a bit of jungle control nothing else take a look at the bottom late bang and zzz Olympic as well throw an ignorant I will say I favor Caitlin is Wayne a fair bitso far things are going pretty well as well check the brush to see you soon as around there and he is rough not pulling back just yet so then they will still at camp and now and I could have damaged hear the Trap was on basil take busy every single skiltron I like that later for Dresher Auto attack really heavy trade in Basel going to come through the last two posts if they've been just taking out his to stay now you get to know supplement that Caitlin play style that we kind of talked about pushing the link continue to poke them under and we sent Zanesville is so low they should be able to force Bank to miss some of the Cs now thus far as he's done just buying grabbing them it is going to get more difficult of santorin also over on this side of the map to kind of give svenskeren a little back for the counter jungling & eggar with the pushing Lane on bottom for flyquest makes sure he's safe to do so ignore going to help make sure yes indeed Central and gets the girl
