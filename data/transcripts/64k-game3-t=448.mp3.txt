100 thieves lost in game 5 to Cloud 9 EG lacity liquid exactly there is no update here either team win notes nobody's going to be surprised so let's get right into the pig banned because when it is disclosed it matters a lot and there are touching on the top line in the Army I don't know what are the differences between the two top laner top winners has been dust far the Jack scary pic for someday and four hundred thieves the impact has not picked up again even though he has a world winning skins on the champions We haven't actually seen him play it and actually seen him carry top sites accept on the redacted I'm still looking at here or the bad bass there it is okay good they go for the redacted instead of doing the Whittle down on the jungle good job Tony I think he'sto the right places here at Versus Evil Genius test even though it does leave open of jungle auction all right and one of those is Olaf right now or do we have to get more lifestyle Deluxe overall healing and it was just fine and if they let time take down double sided fence guys going to take it after all yes we had a couple of jungle bands and case it's obviously also a stellar performer like we said let the robots this year for Jungle position you kind of want to determine do you need engage can you go with a AP carry like Billy or something what are your solo laners going to be to try play off of what type of jungle Champions choosing hear through there is a good all-around thick does AP damage but it's mostly Tanki mostly good Frontline mostly engaged neutral objective and power clearing playing really well off when it lands I would say definitely dispatch11.3 rock that would really hurts though it's fine for now in the ALCS until we get to Live Match Kodi lauriana great combination we saw it already in the last game we're already today excuse me but you know obviously hextech ultimatum it's shockwaves is always great to Champion Terry and signals a lot of options in fight with that and you can push with the Camille Saint of the day seraphine Tyrell was kind of Talk of the Town With the flak Westwind but the stamp go through it is not highly prized Deere 4230 use it mostly went through in the previous game there as well with be looking in the Mortal self instead we've gotten our gravis or answer to Camille that can be a tough 1/4 impact Camille's all in is really strong but there is game played Buffy with Megan are down there and did you gave his only has been great he knows that the Oriana down there in mid and if I don't doubt it would be locked itopen to Oriana because Oriana excels in the Midfield and she can outrange it has beer is a similar idea when you're playing at the Oriana azir does have pretty good wave clear as well as far as protecting that if you're looking at the overall composition Since U G didn't have no desire to go more poke it looks like and fishing with bubbles this is a very standard are we to fight for them and I know it is super controversial picking picking our whether it's in to Camille or whether it's applied in fact is one of the top winners that I actually do have confidence in him playing around the weaknesses well it is mini form is very careful does just no seais with a boomerang that doesn't overcome it to some of those shorter autosmeanwhile the other tells fan to get locked in 200 East Side I want to say is that closed there's a lot more than any other jungler weather for his laptop he just wants to play it on this so often and major carry for the team just overall I'm going to look at that jungle kill stats right now and let me hear ya up near the very top 40 to Kings Cross 11 games as second place to only blabber who's played four games that himself really is a big killer he's he's a really big deal here the Olaf and he doesn't support right he's got a code with the Camille and the Oriana alongside for for the help yeah I mean honestly I've always loves any sports beat up like you're mentioning dive buddies + supportive in a Solo laners for the RR just what he wants now is going to have more dive buddy I'm just needs of also excelled free at their coordinated power. They're very good or have been very good at setting upfor their Matt place in advanced calling their rotation and then executing on these Dives the one I would say that got caught in the throat was versus Cloud9 game 3 they're about to win the series they can feel it they have an early-game advantage and they died Vuitton kente bottom way they give up three kills the attire so come and get this I had it in my mind I was wondering C reverse weave permanently damage types of Thieves doesn't look like it there if they actually clean we pull them off this time around because that's always going to be in the back of your mind when you get reverse whip like that in the series you feel like you should have one of you you might be 2nd ST guessing, that I've definitely don't go you know throwing people three people at a Time cast to get her but there's nothing this game you have some pretty goodafterwards a zero with a shuffle can be really solid but he's all right there locking in or around FBI or dive in and just cause 4 SAFE backline Act or I should say not much active for him he's not exactly terribly mobile but I can definitely come down to it to be good at cutting or the year for the most part will be kind of okay at it support but will be fun to walk for easy certainly a very Dynamic team here as well we know with the sooner you get that things up the Adair cell phones that work on engages fight and I think both of Elias and Zion have very good consistent damage to back things up yeah I actually really like the Ziah point because this is always a champion that I'm looking at even even in times where she's not in the met at all heard the counter dive is so good you know that ultimate alone saving you from stoveany spots we were we were talking about The Misfortune lost its ESFJ we're like what you do and the Camille is on the rift once again so good adaptation there we saw how the Camille destroys immobile carries in that opening a game of the day definitely going to be more difficult this time around I can obviously still do it against a zero as I it's just that I really like your point about the yourself peel for both those Champion for the backline does make you more confident in this five-on-five when you're facing stuff like cut me Olaf a lot are you in the back by anything so you do want to find a way to get out despite those things you can talk with the TSM game it was fly poop poop Banda ways I don't want to let lost have any fun so you can't play the championand definitely the Clayton band me out so I'm going to go for that champion Thai diver going to be there and we'll see if you can survive these Place indeed headed to use are going for some she can play stop site shouldn't be much a pack is no reason to go back but it can also mean they can look for the 130 engage the topside go take a blubaugh and enforce vertical jungling as you see it offensive words from a coup he actually it's from FBI is going to spot out when when steering goes for his own blue take but if we are here exactly it's so coordinated from hunted these and this is something that when when it was announced know who he and the rest of the Guardians are are joining up with six Tony on 100 thieves I I was really excited because those were some of the times in the ALCS that old CLG with sticks and who he that had some of the craziest level 1 the craziest Rome plays early on in games coming in always with a pre-set plan and this one is is very simple topside delayed invade for closerstop taking away power clearing versus another Power clear jungle with a defensive word on their own blue as you pointed out to see their reactions there from Spence care now it's been staring does far on Udyr doesn't have any extra information is just doing the full red quartz and clear and Olaf vs. Udyr it's basically a bodybuilding contest who gets more jacked more quickly because then you take over to my tastes are too heavily those closer has gone over that work as you mentioned the things start to go down and he's going to have to cross if you want the defendant and pull off the three quadrant hear ya applecross the Nokia closer was not spotted until just vanity cross the river there was a ward ultimately yeah could have looked at me as being pressured ignores you to help make sure it's been staring as safe as a cell taken down as far as blooms really make sure that looks safe as well they check Try by Stacey allaster but clothes are was going to show up anywaywhy did you wait this long to make the play the kind of bad allowed to be there by 8. There as well but your cousin species of erised it's not going to be closer comes in a way too late to have a task and it's the way first what do that was rough I I really thought they had this whole thing set up but stopping over okay so this one who throws axe for revision it doesn't hit you can't pick it up so there's no way you can you can actually win this fight it. Does it have accident then he can't actually take Hooter and then went to cool down comes back it's too late to try to get the doc up combo for closer but without that extra damage at the at the beginning with the accident in the ground there it's it's going to be a huge swinging bodybuilding contest sweats Garrett Rd Flexin swole broFirst Blood this is way better with the hoodie Aaron in backed impact looks pretty good. He did they close or combo went well against him in a flash flood in Arkansas to be a repeat Target so stay tuned for this one worth noting do the Boss by jungle foreclosure is still up wolves and prop still available and if you want to go to that side after the scrubs argon flow gauge my plate off overall in 1/4 of a nicely Tracy Stevia paleo then go back to deciliters never going to be enough damage to do anything but that was nicely done nice try by who he doesn't mean much though back to the Jungle do the other big problem with that play is that it delays and you're playing for this timing window where a a triple quadrant control the jungle early on can really delay your opponent but only if you're able to deny them that extra 30 seconds while they have no camps to farm but cancer only two minutes to respond so if you have extra mission the jungle you go down in the one we won you give over the kill it actually doesn't matter at all because it's been scanned still gets to go reform is topside I can come right here in front of you in the second time in a row sister has it kill donated right in his left hand turn to know Toll Brothers really rising up and is going to be an objective here at 400 these though as a closer is able to take down the dragon during the mid killflash traded for Flash that actually might go cop something later but we just had a very nice level leave now here for Spence Karen despite not having flash East should be able to tabouli I was going to say though with the short response of if again you know something happens like that and you're early game goes Haywire then the camp to Tanner jungle just respond anyway so they're just going to be higher level there for her crop and wolves in that's been scanned got to pick up right where you left off that's why he had jumped out to that level lead over closer I do like the early Dragon do 400 thieves let's see if they have bottom line control as well ignore for the dash backwards but still some good damage over, be careful though it's been scaring them away over a good Lord sees that you should be safe sleeper comes out get 10 gold but now the thieves Note 8 we just Bots I have to be careful overcenter this one as a ganar can always flash take me to set it up FBI going to feel safe has flashing you'll himself a mate fighting a war to do to help me go and spend staring to get another Scuttle in a row so a lot of control around right now even if not get to heal back up think somebody fruit and eat I feel pretty comfortable down here on the bottom side x class at Edwards definitely good flash away. To re-engage is so much damn who he is and I don't know who he is down what if you don't plan to ignore it's actually death on your screen flashes then, without any effort at all those back the blades who he my goodness this EG bottom light has been one that has shown up and okay closest going to try and reap the rewards no flash on definitely say go for me look at me please hit me I'll jump back to my team and is just not enough that we wasn't slow and there's too much threat back of the FBI with the wave there so no. 2000 Gold Cup winning basically everywhere this a little bit more about the EG bottom line because it has been one of the super pleasant surprises of this year I E G coming together and having such a strong showing in walk-in was in in no small part due to both of these players definitely playing a lot better than people thought it. Are still getting off a lot of good romance while also lady nicely with them that being said currently not a great look getting awfully zoned off the towers FBI takes time to replayed after to reply to your on the afilia they're worried about to dive and he's got no flash and he had not had access to his level six until rejoining this way than getting his experience there FBI going to go in on him a possibility that God had flash but with The Bodyguard of who he
