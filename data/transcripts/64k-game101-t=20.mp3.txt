game 3 compared to specially games won in do I where they had really struggling this time they were gifted a little bit of an advantage made the most of his credibly well but you've got to say they just look like a completely different Squad went since Karen has the ability to make things happen when he is on pics that allowed to engage the alarm to be proactive and that is something that we did not get to see him playing in games one or two he was more about the farming the team fighting it may have been good individual matchup in the jungle but it just feels like it's dependent ignore to start fights EG depend on Spence Karen and that is why I having them on the Greg it to lease in these types of pics that can be the ones that are practically starting fights and catching a bonus when they're stepping too far forward is so importantI'm curious what this graph looks like it'll be have swapped sides ephelides teams has started to really key on what is a man would not surprise me your thick black was just need to realize that that if and 3 in this composition block get banwick mazzuca yes they are the ones Banning sin away from bang every single game but I think racket is on that to your personally think they know I cannot play Tom kench and maybe they can test the gragas we will see keep my last game Emoji bands of certainly we saw that there was not a lot of power from the Pike in that game that said obviously delivers to look at but it's a no no no no no game and there's always thought process do you emphasize your own strengths or do you attack the your opponent's strengths right and hear it here when I was talking about since Karen and ignorant these two key and Gatorsthe key and gate number for flight with what does he wouldn't be able to do almost anything and be just got out of jail free card for back so 529 that they're opening up the opportunity for ignore to pick something that is going to affect the game to get aggressive and to enable his play style you may end up giving up gragas as a result of that but that to me flyquest showing confident in their own strength saying that hey great you play your best we play our best we're going to winyeah it would be fun to watch for we'll see if this does come through the very end Misfortune or an is going to be the EG pick up they have constantly picked it looks like 14 fighting Indians draft overall we had the the coolest games for example this is this Fortune + Oren of course we know Lauren has great engaged to Akuma should be comfortable here and then we'll go hit our I'm hoping to get in line those off he had some very very bad misses back in the first game we have again this trundle picked into orange restaurant Frontline we again have the atrox into orange soda have a lot of things I ignore will play is a krakus time you've got to go to your own strengths you can't just try to allow your opponents to dictate the draft day off with their picking all the time and you got to play your own game and I do think of this is eg playing their game this is Kumho on something that does not need attention that is going to have relevance in the team fight and dispense Karen on the playmaker this is bang on a strong team playMarksman playing their game and and likewise if you think for 5 foot 10 toward is left about the engage and more about controlling and tracking his opponent will have a great amount of power comes inside Time by reducing the power of Google on the Warren and also few freezing his own tackiness so I do think of this is the most evenly-matched draft it feels like the other theories as far going back and forth okay well both teams have constantly like so far will Seattle breakfast place out so do washing at the break we will see you when the game starts for those you online item or targeting to worth a ganar take away the blood through a conical ready gone if they really want to focus on him they could even bannout the pike but I do think you may want to throw something power of evils way if you are worried about a pic like Victor if you don't think that you have an answer or if that's too too big of a farmer then you can go towards things like that cuz they're concerned is the catheter in this actually the second captain in band that do we have drawn so far I would be shocked if power of evil or willing to go towards applying kassadin so maybe this is signifying that they're not actually staving data that Midland Pick 4 last but that doesn't really do you really have nothing you're willing to play into it because generally speaking there are a lot of bad bad matchups for Catherine you already have a strong early Alan King juggler in the garage so beer is good for us we do you can counter pick a catheter if you're not willing to play the other side of the match up so early but there is a chance to talk to flex register or in the support and that's also part of it end of the day they grab this and will be support last I think it's a hundred percent I know there's a possibility but the counter picking for the TV 2 and then it's saying did you get enough out of it because Victor or some sort of farmmatch of any such a stable midliner exceptionally rare to see him go down like you did in the last game and it's just interesting because you're kind of putting yourself in a situation at 480 where are you getting the most out of red side right side is about having advantageous Lane matchups to me do they have any I guess it depends on this for pick right in and if you go for that support that can you win to be to through that because Top Lane is is a losing backed up I do think that Midland it's just a farm matchup and bought Lane remains to be seen it so it's it's kind of like I'm always disappointed when I see teams go right sided and not get winning match ups and that's what my real concern I guess that for the DG draft but I still do think that they have on teen fight like the draft ended up I realize that I agree with you that's so often the red slides goal is to get good grades but a lot board at least have a great front line has been back but they don't have which are pretty weak terms overall temperature in this game overall in right but I still like for the draft ended up welcome back brace for ESPN viewers does the draft start things like to go to bed at 5 for me to pay Saint traft I do think she has a better job that I liked it a lot and and yeah it mean maybe it's maybe it's a smart read because you're playing against POV and you're saying you're not going to go crazy or just going to go to farm at 2 and that maybe a read more about the teas and unless something that they feel it can be punished there and anytime you're playing you me into something that cannot all in really really have late such as the Bronx you're feeling really good about it so they may have gotten enough out of this out of the Spot Lane last pic with that you mean and that I think going to be a really big focal point of the game Helix Austell be taken by the enemy so Bank Needham play cleanse doesn't have to worry as much about any potential no Fromme son or or roof rebellious and that is going to give him some freedom to to kite more easily he's also very likely taking Nimbus cloak which will help them out in the team fights it's a kite some of these Mila Champions like the triangle and like the atrox do want to point out of course we are still in 10.6. The entirety of playoffs of the most recent not on board with Fair bit so he's going to have a face but I think you're hard-pressed to find a winning match up here against mfu me so I do want to see what EG can do Down Here Without a late and they threw for flyquest here comes the sweet breakfast in Turin placement knowing how wide receivers going to be sent word doesn't know they saw this they won't get to go to XP either and it will allow easy to make good choices but responds to it because this has gone and either way I agree and tells me forward great to have that information even if it's only to say ah crap but at least you know what's going on with see where Spencer and can go but no Greg is starting leashless on his Red Bluff is going to be a lot more slow he is going to be going over towards his opponents blubaugh and and then it kind of becomes how much can you take out of honest jungle right dust removal. We are on this quadrant because clearly they want to split the map they want us to be stuck playing up on that top side where he could get attacked by the date rocks and he's actually looking for a level that was spotted by Ward solo can just have her back yeah he's supposed to level two as well with the wave pushed in weight for a minion now he has the dash with the dash up that you're not really getting that Gandalf to it isn't have a date follow-up has been secured at least able to raid Buffs back so they will have equal Buck house for the question is the rest of the camps could be with me or going to be there first early jungle pathing Yasin by Ward who cares black West cleanly up to Camp Saint Saint torrent as an amazing start or just meant weigh more after getting pushed off you know he's he's losing his is quadrant on the bottom side of all those jungle camps and he gets swatted not just rushing for a trade above he gets spotted trying to do a level to gank that is the low percentage play against the state rock for the little one has died from his own so bench warrant is going to be three Camp ahead at the end of the day because there's nothing for a sincere and even Farm gifts that was not damaged but there's not really any more follow-through and realistically you can recall whenever you want on trundle and the same as well. Not going to really hurt him very much he was going to shut the way you've been but still it's going to be up for a little bit of far lost for words the wave reset button is plus 5 well it's actually pretty bold once I will heal wait to see what else comes out of this one but not a bad start to the bottom Lane mid-wave a farm as well so at least the various Outside Lands are nice but one thing to you before they rushed the aesir Pick 4 but I've been staring level two man for the job but you can hit Level 3 like well before 3 minutes right so that kid is going to think she can hit it like a champ get to to have the leader Refresh on its Red Bluff you just now picked that up so he's kind of bad already here and level four and a half here comes the flight he Dodges a slope of the pillar is going to do the same precleanse comes daddy supposed to burn the flat why not just flashed away over the pillar have to lose both Summoners a repeat game could go well there by bank I think it was pretty obvious you had the flash as soon as santorin actually guessed up obviously thought he could maybe I'll play it or are really make something else happen there but you know when you when you cleanse in that situation sure you move his roof but you're still loaded by the pillar with three members stacked on top of you hitting you to write and day does open up the opportunity for potentially and easy repeat gang okay the flash for Patricia Luckett the route there is no way out for bangs impossible to live in this point onwards they make the kill goes over and first blood comes to wild turtle and getting killed early on in the game a great there from flag left and a really intelligent game dates that wasn't even the answer to that time bottom Lane White getting his bottling to be to First Blood and what it supposed to be this losing match up in what was the red side dipstick for EG that is supposed to be there there big pressure Lane and it is losing yeah oh my gosh bang head Burns Poe Summoner so it's a it's a metal roof that if it's guaranteed kill every time without some of those up I just don't think he could have got out without Splash but it would have been closer at least maybe if you have clams are you can make them work for it a bit more but and we are we are pushing in that at least you don't have rewards the trundle gang becomes very threatening turn volume is not scary if your back near your turret but when you are very far up all of a sudden the pillar becomes a really big deal for any type of champion that doesn't have a dash to easily Escape over it and MF is obviously in that group at what other day we got so without running into the middle Lane Suzuki is a little sick person with power of evil to get spotted. We've been thinking song I think they just saw you was there a little walk down and the day is not going to be too much but he had the time you stepped in the way if he's going to look for the play big deal EGR still probably pretty well Spencer is doing his best. But he's a course at least Builders remaining down a level four have to do kick it hand over the flu Baughman we'll see if he needs you can lick their wounds while and I still look for team fighting the question is going to have another four thousand gold different through the game. Killer was right thing and it just cannot get away to go back to the source and yet again they find that guilt away but there's not forming gold on this Misfortune they're just getting blast and it's bothering by these Gangsta Gangsta been so effective and the fact that they put spent during this far behind time this means that stop farming it out he's stuck trying to catch up an experience and he's still down to level C may have 5 off of this will will see you know he's is still down well over
