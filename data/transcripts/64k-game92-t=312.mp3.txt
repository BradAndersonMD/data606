and I he didn't do something damn it back then and we just got. One deposit thing again R1 and oseph on the LCS picking up where they left off as what seems to be the most dominant team in the league has had a rough start against a very solid Evil Geniuses they have a rootle schedule with how well EG played in the first couple of guineas that is obviously a pretty tough team to go up against them to have Cloud 9 as your follow-up game is that things could get worse easy going for but you want to see if they can really compete with these Topsy's deal can they hold their own against Cloud 9 no make it at least competitive I am really looking at that Top Lane Dallas have to talk about a lot somebody really had an incredible string split regular season and playoffs did not match up well in those playoff series do you know I want to see what time they can bring beer on the right side will they prioritize him a little bit more than yesterday because yesterday he was Snowblind picking Warren I would love to teach them date get an advantageous match up against Liquor Agency can you win through your toppling can you have the Superstar top laners dumdei try to take over the game a little bit when I'm back back Olaf game Deer for bladder has been a super highly prized top to jungaleers upload videos played yesterday or I should say on Saturday no Friday there we go through as well be happening worldwide most picked top laner as the end of the LPL have any more games on Wukong to do on Oren but they're going to lock up their Cody sun on the mic I think he's been one of their best board members in the game so far and some days feel like the lake insurance and asriel you lie already locked the Cloud 9 feels like without her teeth are more willing to use someday as as this one picks and they are willing to pick for him it's one of those situations where it feels like they're saying okay if you're good enough to win or or be okay and ever knocked up maybe some of the other players aren't but then it becomes this is just got to know should you emphasize strength or sure up weaknesses and it feels like they're using somebody to show up the weakness of of Rio Alma who does often struggle in this Lane and you don't have been having as good of a time but then you know your kind of taking away one of your major wind conditions which is something that I dropped off about how hundred thieves draft because I just think that somebody stuck a talented me later if you get them winning matches as he showed in Spring that can just win you the whole game right and now you're taking that completely away and you're putting him in a situation where you know it's not going to slam Licorice and then you're relying now on on Wyoming and Cody them very heavily and in those guys I think are not matching up as well perhaps some day is nice outside and I was going to take the Devil's Advocate side of this one which is hey maybe it's none of these trying to flush us wrestling team thing looked yet summer split this is the one that this is Two Worlds were going to do well as do that but we've got 9 week and playoffs to like be in that form let's find ways to go about them they won binibining through that lens I fully accept him if he's putting something out of Ryoma and mediocre the rest of that Squad to be ready because if that is your goal that I think that makes complete logical been to play that way so I still look grief if I'm trying to win a game right now it's like hey was it banned let's get some Alabama championship Def Leppard had last time around it is. Previous game he was actually playing you know that pull off and keep your can actually fair I pretty well know since he was going to give consent or at least in some different games but they're pretty well against the law that you have to be very careful of face checking if you were the one getting the jump on Olaf and you can use your view of the dance of arrows to actually Dodge out the old off of Acts that becomes a woman that you can actually win early on if that's if you do have red spots but if you are Fey checking that all off and hit that for a fact you are going to be doomed though I will see how many videos can play this year we have to be careful to make sure he knows where Olaf is and a Time fix down Gangplank is hovering cloud like a lock that one in so hey we're getting a fighter up their shot at the Jazz last rational game on their butt looks like DP coppin against orange to be an exciting one that would be whole bunch of fun if you were by the way up right on the the Kindred Olaf what it was just that match up as opposed to expense Karen so media is playing the reverse matchup that he played up on Friday and as you mentioned blabber getting his second Olaf games straight as it's going to be the rest of the squad The Incredibles but Galley open follow up on it but easy that you often struggle to find Opportunities to really use that well so well with hard engage things like like the not Afflicted Jarvan you know even the work on canvas that are guaranteed go but what are your go button is to Zoloft pressing ultimate and running towards his opponent that you're hoping that that is going to give you that perfectly Oh Holy Night I struggle to see that happening so I do think that cloud 9 actually doesn't have the best draft hear that being said you can use it as counter gauge and one thing I do have to point out is that Kelly was incredibly good and Dequindre. So what you can actually do with when the kids are dropped the ultimate you then time your ultimate to land as the Kindred ultimate is expiring you have the time to come out of that and it pretty much guarantees a team fight win if you can get that combo time perfectly that being said to use ear is also there to shuffle people out of the country so it's really going to depend on those interactions and who can use that best if it does come down as he fights what for though it's it's it's hey it's about new presents they ever look at the Circle get ready for the crock of the Comedown it's going to be explosive in 3 2 1 and 1/4 Hilton both sides for I'm glad you went to the counter gauge side because that that is what it feels like sand I have to do here is what I've got the Azrael UV poke they clearly pick for a toppling counterpick write R in the metagame special North America were you expecting early or and so so getting cops around what we're going to play Gangplank in the second round draft and then we're going to play around Side Lane in the rest of our team is waived there and cut her and gave you that is at least a look that scene and can show us and yeah I want to know if it works well because on the opposing side azir Kindred afelius right there is some very very good back light damage amount of these side it feels like to me is that scene is actually drafting tools go for man bought over and over I think that they're going to use this you me as real to poke out the bottom Lane 30 use the Olaf to push mid with this galio to get priority there and then they're going to do it four-bedroom down to buy side Olaf runs into try to dive this for a galley assaulting on top of them you have is really knew me for those also try to lock them down and I think you may see Gangplank just farming up in that Top Lane Alton bought on cool and I think that is going to be the game plan so we'll see if hundred thieves can identify that and react to it sometimes it's a lot easier said than done to answer any C9 aggressive plays because they are so consistent about them there so quick to pull the trigger on those moves and you've got to be matching them you'll punch for punch blow for blow the entire game long or seen I was running over I'm always intrigued position that that's how far of a game plan then just hears what are five on five looks like well we got to engage we put before him to know that the cop is around the first 15 minutes where where does never out of Bot Lane 12 CS at 12 minutes and well better botwin's goes for me too in this Lane like a sort of second level you're doing things that aren't as standard in your generically compositions and I mean you can even see the inside of 4 niskey is is working more towards us as well you take the minion dematerializer you can dematerialize Canon waves instantly wave pure out the rest of that with your QE put Paso if you know a wee Auto and then guess what your roaming it is yours that is stuck having to either give up to it that way to match the room or his going to be behind on that room so that is something that is a really intelligent way to set up if you're looking for the sort of played Paladin here we go a blabber starting off with the sweeper and notice how he actually donate to CS over to licorice if you give that one word kill to a Solunar they will actually get that level to one minion sooner and we have can actually made it matter why is a real trouble he walked into what I believe was XP Ranger as well and that should mean that both of them should be getting a little TV off of just the first wave give me the Lawton stop playing that thing is so volatile down there is the lanes show up perfect csgo far for these best he can as well bladder expand the power Farm duties blue start machete Chucky Down single soccer camps no problem with Zoloft cats singing We have seen a couple different looks so far in a blabber obviously yesterday A lot of it was, stating about getting really aggressive trying to steal away camps consoling with this olafe y'all so did go for a fairly impressive field yesterday with the warrior we've been seeing mostly Warrior thus far this season where it can in the past but he left it to me hasn't seen a lot more kind of tank Aloft they do have quite a bit of Michigan is going to be interesting to see if he wants to go for that full damage style I just kind of pair up with that Union and fly in there and try to knock people down early and a very small early CS Lidl Icarus was something smells a little bit of blood flow licorice better be careful the punch comes in a Flash would kill him and that means Liquors has to flash a way about Sunday's wouldn't let against the counter picker Leon is liquor a step too far up Dad me that's always the danger of Warren into these melee matchups is that yes this is a match up where I do scaling in QP that you can really come to the farm at Lake game but the bridge Proxes do so much damage and now that the wave hasn't been able to be pushed in Italy purse was looking to try to shove that way I wasn't able to get it in is down Flash and now he's in this really expose spot where he backs off the wave is frozen if he doesn't get exposed to a gang cat videos up here so I think licorice is probably going to die without that why don't you hate that I'm here comes with low not to leave this one has yet but easy pick up their first Blood the hundred thieves media starts up Sunday for really well played in the back of the fridge what goes okay laughter flash they're not too bad but the fact that first wife goes to war makes it even harder and guess what he doesn't even get to just walk back too late he's got a TV because a way to still screwed the wave is still frozen up there so we need to get this into the turret and this is one of those situations where the one mistake early on from licorice starts to Snowball the fact that he miss played those are really crazy at the flash me if he still needs to stay around unfreeze the wave me tell pork and Concerta kind of snowball these these errors into a difficult situation so good punished by someday and videos then I will see how licorice Kendrick up I'm going to do is very best managed to push the way the rest of the way in we saw blabber was able to take the top River they actually kind of site Safety Dance finish of course I didn't recall making teleport back alright so flash advantage of to All Things Considered but it seems that can be another dank Target the other part of that that you know I have to address also is the fact that while he is a thing that time Yankee charge straight to take that away from somebody else didn't get a mark from either of those good old is going to be behind in farm and then it came to the situation where you know if you try to regain can do lots of Darren Olaf is just way stronger than that Kendra your Olaf can just completely change that fight out though that can be pretty rough and you can see somebody actually use this TV but it's taking the bad end of a couple streets immediately after so Gangplank is service hearing himself back in this Lane someday in a free low a man that behind on health if you get hit by too many of those Gangplank use with grass but are you are going to get stomped out as and really start to lose control in that area well right now the media is going to go back to the bottom of the map and what's Dundas and Cody Sun finishing their recent recalls and it didn't come in early times beef Elliott's goes berserk Grieves over the more space if you can get it be up for a recall but ask the extra for down there was a very very early pick up under these it was more of a window of opportunity you're playing at the TPS real so you need to take those recalls as a value of the things when you end up looking for the all-in will you broke the first and I'll be easy punch knuckles for the floor doesn't it licorice I don't know if that was a misclick are we meant to go for that one but liquor is now feels comfortable to hit back at Sunday is out of cool down some health back up there's a bit of it look like a cancelled Auto you know we did have it riddle crock not sure that that went as well as he was hoping licorice also still has the ultimate so someday be a bit of an awkward spot but I think it was just kind of a window of opportunity for a belly has to take that reset you getting that early dragon is great especially when Kindred is the one behind the face of the Olaf we saw yesterday about 9 it was kind of having this this back-and-forth game with life was and the reason they really started to actually take over was the objectives why they got themselves so they got themselves Elder they took all the original Dublin so deny that stacking condition was great was the flat back over the wall axe going to land solo and cannon mirage red licorice to kill against the opposing jungle alert Isaac like right back up is there a purchase it there's no escaping for something he has no TP it's 3 minutes hop is yours mid the junk was dead they know there's no way out there so they just need to do it cleanly pulling aggro here early flag can I get rid of the top of the NACA to spill verithin easy walk away Nikki has no problem making that died vaping flower going to leave some gold
