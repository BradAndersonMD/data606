beginning never have lost their spot I am glad they're in this last week the entire organization kind of exploded they let go of their GF of their coach and their entire starting LCS rosters what switching with the academy roster stuff as you said the academy roster that's moved up for Mortals now actually has more familiar faces to me than the LCS roster did Ashley with alarm having a scandalous deck segment on Friday is very well on for alarm here going up against Hunter deviljho be difficult but yeah they target band him already with his ergot which he did just play in academyyeah I I probably have a somewhat negative opinion hero valorem now he is physically in a cat a starch right thing is so was Laura Lowe is completely acceptable here as well but he has not been successful in Academy. Roster has three and three of the academy league in Apollo with a lot of heavy lifting after those two are absolutely no standouts on that team would start having a very bad split so far the Apollo talk about it laterall right going straight down the list here or Jana into the Twisted Fate One of the classic story on a man gaining a lot more present and in Europe as well volibear picked up for the golden Guardian definitely still keeping it as a flex by kind of expected to go into the hands of on Sir with the way that golden Guardians have had their identity as a being kind of reach day they had closer on the power climbing big DPS champion from the jungle paired with something that they can come join him within this realm is perfect. That they will keep Steve oliverez if they don't have to reveal yet if it's a top or a bottom and they can actually hold that fix all the way till fishplay the washboard to speed where the ends of going up to see Golden Gardens in support of locked in their middle and bottom line so they need Jungle Top and fixing to pick support first time around and then you know wait till the very end of a couple of are you going to see the start Banning away good fighter top laners is gone but the ergot fan as well that leaves malphite has been found a way that goes for your this month but he has to have arguably to have to cut a quasi blanket to match up against Build-A-Bear can eat at least go in Jungle get rid of the tanks that are good in the Raton Aquatic Center there and there's not really a good match up tissues into fall of there as far as the saying goes but lets you are kind of getting your team and I'm freaking some I like a range backed up to try and use jungle pressure with a range bass up to get them behind so it's not like you can easily have some sort of melee countervolibear in your pocket that's what they do come up with a splitting them between the jungle on top light in here and as you're expecting some of the answers and silver, you know the tank your one that will lock him down Nautilus and Leona are two of the main ones but they actually go with some of this has been taken away from a bilious decent match of overall they're more worried about the loop for the hiding in the back line makes sense but it means again to pull the biggest reflecting pool is very very end of the world going to pick themselves the matchups pool I would say it's still very open building razor up trundle is I think it's a very good pick overall there would not be shocked and just in general speaker Singapore on the champion and I'm a little surprised to with the with the Lulu van like yeah you know there's your kind of worried about late-game buffering of his values but to medirections to work on if the wrist stretches skilled is so good at the blades interrupting the dash is trying to hook to work on afterwards as well when he's a straight line dashing back on the 8th buried always seem like they're pretty easy moves there's about five that you mention alarm at played in the academy and I'll just be the guy and I would love to see a heart that would be awesome I would love to see a lot of come out ABS brutalized with no recourse at all instead mordekaiser build top 5 well that one because it's baking show up as well if you to build Mr Boulevard has plenty of physical self look pretty good in that top play match of overall Immortals going to be gone and Oriana All Foreign gate and are freedepalo and if you spend a good comeback line yeah I honestly think alarm is in a really tough spot here like you're saying they were outside in academy and he has to early pick and also gets a really good counterpick more days so good at grinding down tanks are you take conquer all of your entire kit is basically towards grinding down takes another Bailey matchups so like maybe he didn't and builds one of the lice half damage Bell fights that I don't think that's likely cuz I also think that has a less a lower chance of success plus then gives your team later as they won't have as much of a front line will see how they can get through this one and Apollo are back that's what you're trying to focus. If you started from the beginningout at the beginning of split saying look we scrimmaged all this Define that they had started to split with was the five-day thought had the Best Buy assume the best chance at winning and that has not come through four of those five starters potluck being the exception were top 10 index in the ALCS coming into the week not having a very good start was fine I know he's been getting a lot of flak online I thought he was on the team behind potluck such as it is though they have replaced all five with the academy roster and we'll see this one looks a bit better I think maybe one or more players can mix and match in down the line but this the look and I think it will look better overall they're up against what just got this might be one of three I did Golden Gardens are a pretty strong team that really gives very good things in their shot clinic they are a threat in this league and we'll see if that plays out for that got a pretty fun roster here who's the fake getting all around the map the volibear jungle I'm always a fan of seeing as well that Champions really fun to see haven't played him myself but he's in a lot of my games at schoolreally fun at the hotfix and the extra bucks that were laid down in at 10:12 that's so much more tankiness and damaged and I love the press the attack my personal favorite ruined a lot of people messing around with various movespeed rooms in the face Russian Predators a lot of top winners go conqueror but press the attack if you so much worse damage because you're W applies to stack account says as a hit for it so you can get your W-4 Auto W Auto off of pretty quick one of them being your your que Autos as well so he actually has a lot of up front-loaded damaged and I would be confident taking him into trundle in early duels as well so we'll see how you navigate this cuz closer has been a very good aggressive jungler always looking for invades always looking to play off of any golden Guardians land that is pushing usually with Demonte and usually heading down bottom linewith Demonte as we showed with the stats in the intro slide right now small leash therefore closer what does so much to Red Bluff butsmithy everything blue at least let's hear shouldn't be the worst thing in the world but is just a little slow over all right no help this thing actually has a favorite of armor smithing to pull it all the way over right now and then I'm going to go drop in that is deficient efficiency the name of the game I thought the entire jungle roll is built around deficiency and time spent at least killing or Warden always doing something proactive Mississippi has been one of the best his entire career in the ALCS at optimizing that always trying to get a clearer path that will set him up for defensive options early for his lame in most cases but sometimes offensive ones as to in this case with this chance for life I would say definitely would have to be more Vision independent minded as like I talk about polar bears going to have a big advantage over you closer to the power steering right through and level 3 and food have priority on the box crap. Crap, did you mention the fleet footwork on the mordekaiser Woodruff Preferred Auto which basic guarantees he can like just like walk at you with the auto tax give you the password goes off and enforce alarm to The Runaway the second dose even a trade yes conquerors better in a long-term fight so why not just make sure you can think about it all and you know a little bit of extra Newsfeed goes a long away with the champion in in the melee matchups out the alarm with the comment for malphite might be going a little bit more AP heavy it just helps you out in my favor force allows you to have a decent trade because you're cute slow, basically guarantee you your comment hits especially on those Champions getting a little bit more States before him that's what it is well and apparently we got word I've just been picked the wrong one I think I sent in contact that's a long way you know I don't really good but I still believe it I'm sure it's like the overall win rate to look use weaker Minds The Night Taylor there's a Chase in Flames not going to stop an ocular knew he was going to walk back way cannot just land that roof of hakamo-o could be in danger flashes of demotic covering for the bottom line their know they're still teleport on Insanity cuz he went with the cleanse worried about gold cards coming his way and it really good just in case by The Immortals bottom way and XFinity to be able to get out of that that was teleport for double Summoners off of Pablo not the worst of Worlds and considering they also were able to load of one off of a few key for the 4th at 5 so definitely successful move your bike Smithy did reveal him though and a lot of clothes and go for the NBA MBA diversity hard there was a team around they're going to try Here Comes the Sun there comes the damage closer walkaway cannot trade back maybe a fleet he'll know he's going to turn around at Samantha's going right behind get some damage watch out for the juice out of the side of that one but yeah if you're into this Earth are okay how so that's why I want to be able to put this under the turret as Bowser here and taking it as a one-way trip for sure that you see that color from 6:50 because that's very good with his pillow placement kind of at Legacy trundle player through several different metals and he cut off any sort of Escape classes in there's no way he's getting out of sticks or anything so does trade the kill put alarm steelfield the front of it with some of those text messages going down teleport using immediately by him to get back out the lane so that it's not worse of a CS discrepancy and that's going to mean that golden Guardians have teleport priority once again the bottom line for Mortals is going to have to worry about that for summer. It was Demonte well guess what you still have to worry about the top laner now Hunters level six and has teleport advantage over Aurora which takes away a lot of the possible bite from a hospital play Knockin the controllers 50 still going to farm up pretty close in CS overall they got the Phila killed down there that's going to go first as well both supports on a baby with Ear Force has cleanse get away but honestly I really like the play if you if you can get double supports runs off and force that as Mortals Hears a Who is Shockwave Lance display with Aftershock might just kind of wait for the Kit Kat and he walked in gets hooked to cleanse now as it could be a trade Devante going to fly that is a Reggie special lens the blue card Insanity lives down in the aftermath is still going to be divided they getting a dirty plate and probably a dragon for the golden Guardians as they retreat but that could have been knocked out why for your dog
