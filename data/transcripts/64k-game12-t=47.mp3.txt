sound reducer take me to split the map that I think they galio is Big with that as well you already have a dominant oplinger give a dominant bot Lane do not allow them to have a mid laner who can move around the map so easily who can enable those with the map and it got to avoid what you were trying to do right exit what happened to get a lot of pics in the jungle allow them to get a lot of a side length plays that really kind of set Immortal so far behind before they even got there first thing but that's true that's why I wanted to talk about it that if you have gone so you can't deny both want to pick them and I don't have expect to see Darren early or anything to really really really with a poplin dominant now instead for the galley or like to see if we can decide their kind of awkwardMidland Shanty decision because of this but I still think this is kind of playing it a little bit in 200 you can we'll see what they want to drop the ones that the f--- if they do take it but you are expecting him to go for that you do think that they are especially after last game a massively better macro team playing the map you know more intelligently I think than one mortal did do what will the Immortals can actually match them in a fire for fire if they go for galio you're going to have to be a galley on one side presumably will have some sort of Carrie alongside the tfv4 someday to try to just match that I alternatively they could just put some day too strong of on something a little bit more safe and play down towards the font Lane just try to enable FBI and who he is a all right with Dan Mcneil Gallia were to win through Botley we're going to stack dragons and play there there have closer on Braves another Power farmer hear another raise DPS of course it is physical but we'll seethey want to take it for Top Lane yeah that might be the late answer at the very end to your curious if he's going to have misgivings I'll be at the answers to what he did is Lily asked if they have a mix of damage pipes outside and then you just take me to Sabatino's you're almost you do it not inside that either right physical damage to Elaine's magic damage in the jungle wouldn't be shocked if you had another therapy now. Can you play you know nothing about late they look who got in a physical will will switch it up and you know they still made play the medic tile in the jungle you know what you might still be able to renew her in this kind of competition. For this going to be down the line but looks like hundred thieves are not going to go for toppling just yet Phil let something to eat more baths can stop it wouldn't make no sense who has not even played it yet in lock in I don't really see flashes as this all-powerful champion at all these days maybe they were really worried about like a direct Elisa or something but CF then not even taking value yourself now almost just like Doom toast a bun you put them on a carry but now he's going to have tire fixed and you have do you have to play towards it like what is the Camille really supposed to get done I just already worried that your top leader is absolutely screws here sure as far as if you're if you're going to drop these dinner bot Lane no damage style and it makes sense to have Lucien in the mid lane but then why would you go for the Camille why not just go towards tank top Lane that needs less resources or go towards another enchanter Tom plane because having Lucian mid that draws your jungle right Roz you no pressure there so it does feel pretty strange we just see if you're in the Dragons band out so trying to protect the phone up on that top side brightness can be played in the bot Lane but mostly we haven't seen play top link these days the realm and sent me that I want to play a sport because well as great into those likely Jonas that's feels like it's telegraphing that they want to play on a bot Jack's is a gray internet Camille you can win the lane early you out scale in the one do you want to guess what he is DF on his game so now we're already play the game anymore mashup again someday who has a GF on his team and that was your first pick like what is a cat with that they got nothing so I feel like hundred do you spell already practically checkmated them on this draft they do go for the Leona which was kind of you know what it is you're telegraphing that they wanted when they banned out the real because of that matchup but they could still just go straight to the Alice are they clearly knew what they wanted to do with that last pic if we only got taken to go immediately to the Alistar 5th grade engage on the bus side they have a winning side lengths winning 131 I think the team fight you know it's more subjective it's going to be obviously down to how to play it out but this is going to be a really really tough game for Mortals with the ignite teleport being covered I wonder if it's going to be that kind of that kind of crazy on me so I'm Bill we did see a little bit from Vin at World's but I am expecting cuz of the melee matchup with he won't go there I think he's just trying to try to Cheesman all in early it and pray that you can win Lane that way but you know if I'm play Top Lane and I play against and ignite top laner you just play defense of early and wait for your TF2 come and you don't fight before that pretty much and in that case it becomes very very difficult for them to get anything done with that then flashes just worth much more when you are in the v u v and ignite in a really does kind of taper off as far as its value in the one's he won the further you get into the game in my Xperia you have border health bar in just your office the village in the first place like that one of the nine Champions played more than 10 times Genesis lowest win rate champion at 31% across like almost 30 plays it has not been successful for him he is once again on a supportive role with this team he's there to help dilution the Camille set up so he's going to bring some crackers hold down there I know it isn't going to be popular in this patch is very very good with gale-force we are sold 1.1 / gale force has a shortcut to a good Champion he just has not been successful on it himself which is get off of me to put a pin in and then watch as it goes down not expecting to get them to get a lot done down in the bottom Lane and again at level 6 going to have to go to one of those sides and it's not going to get really scary when it comes through Jackson I was up and kill but obviously something else down there with Jenna No Escape so might be a tough one to run for a 25-minute Nexus semifinals it's going to have to be something pretty special hear from a mortal sin does feel like it may need to come from the mid lane Lucian with the cleanse here into the TF maybe can get some sort of inventors there if they can get pretty going maybe there's a way in for this game but it's going to be really really tough so it is so it makes more sense to Omni Stone I think is more of a arrange matchup type thing and that's kind of where we thought being used at Worlds grass is really strong four-lane it is the best of the rooms as far as you do melee vs. melee for your laning phase it allows for really powerful trade we just get the cuegrass product plus you're passive for the physical damage Shield it makes it difficult for your phone is going to trade back into that and grass plus ignite is pretty much the strongest possible you were laying can get unless you want to forgo tell pork completely and go with flash at night but that's just really not something you see in competitive play ignite exhaust at all ignite exhaust igniters on all right that's unfortunate. Yep potluck on the chicken so this information they gave we don't know about and not me some day does Bronson top or cannot quit pushing all the way out but does for Sunday enough that he's not going to take him to damage after this done so no big harms their I'll just see you some wanted to let grass come out so hops away but closer or snowing the invade happens is okay you let chickens to read I will go Blue to your red and I'm now curious how many other camps it's going away composer choose to wait and get crutches as well can he you know going to take the chickens on top is Potluck exhuming down the toilet, as well as the dash so we just gets a red so he is going to be down one Camp overall I will see how much that does end up mattering because of course there are scheduled to fight over and take over Dodge God that is a couple hundred Health off of someday top put it really nicely and we know everyone saw him down the dragonpit as he gets the Red Steel on topside Hill not far for 45 seconds so free time to fight up there to get the better of the trade was really a message on new generally speaking if you're on the back but you want to have your hair is on your. Stone on the deck of The Counter Strike up for when they hook shot and then they hook shot into you but you have the dog Zone available to get to take to damage in the Sun but they can't actually followed up with any sort of Auto attack so that's why I kind of got excited they're seeing that was actually expiring as he was going to be going in for the hookshot to wouldn't have that available and as a result he does get somebody fairly low but Sunday is playing crafting potion has biscuits on his going to be able to sustain up quite a lot here so we'll see all right big man and now it feels like it's a must-have skill up on top side if you do not kill off someday here with his way of pushing away from him it already feels like you are so doomed somebody isn't really bad spot but these are too damn good at these Dives this was so perfect making sure I hit FBI cast Billy Jonas we could actually get full damage in on the 80 land his W-2 praca Plasma on both of those as well and really really really nicely done and they do the same thing as they did the previous game as well where they reset the a grown entry. The second player and now who he on the road here has no flash good night just yet to Camp leave for potluck but killing this is for closers I miss you way way better and this is Off to the Races again under these up 7800 gold outstanding yep and then anything about who he being up there is you're worried at the jacked when you are pushing in the way of his kind of in that neutral position because you don't know where Lily is you know Camille has ignite that is where you died you're going to die in this Lane the movie being up there even though they're organic didn't work it gives him the freedom to shut that it because now Camille can all it because he doesn't know where the Alistar is who he stayed up there for a long time didn't show anywhere to make sure they had the safe to do that so somebody got a free recall is PP was down goes back to base refill the potions buys another Ward and to be feeling pretty comfortable I think at this point in the line you're feeling great so far under these I have just a very small see us deficit in top and meaningful but everywhere else in the mat basically the assistant Devonte pastry she asked about like I'll be asleep just completely trashed by The Immortal side so easy easy riding so far you can see they're not walking towards that dragon as Joey can try to play for the Disney very safe right now Eeveelution could move first bought like pressure out of a dragon pretty early on I want to see a potluck and get a thing done now cuz he has a two-level weed in a full two levels you can see closer is closing in on level 5 but currently closed doors level four and recalled is level six right now if you can get something done immediately without ultimate without an image that you do have then maybe there's a way to start calling back injury reading more of a lead for yourself I like to do a good job with yearly jungle pathing and he stole two camps away to just the one is closer and closer not going to pull off that bought Lane time you'll be very far ahead so public needs to do more than just need to be proactive make use of this early ultimate and try to get it killed try to dive Top Lane now and see if you can kill off some day use this ignite use the Lily ultimate because otherwise it's just losing value right now he's doing the best he can to adjust Farm I know you want to see gang Staffing multi-level to do something that's going to push the way there yet he's got a 3 Wave 2 wave lead. That's only something but it's not manifesting too much else has probably just goes for the damage build is doing fairly standard you would go play at steel cops and yeah what's feel pretty good about that one now being closer step up and looked What I Hear by nearly going to do this will be number to Super potluck and finally what go aboard of the Big T V when they're letting a multi-man sleep potluck getting it done the flash Q3 man sleep closer was very low already had jumped over the wall and Immortals as a result are able to clean up that bite and close the gold lead quite a bit so actually ahead three hundred gold at this point and doing very well and it's a it's a nice play in the needed one for them and in what was feeling like it was a game heading towards how to do use favor but it's closer did go for the invade their oh this is a really want to play do you still have to be done shut up Sunday
