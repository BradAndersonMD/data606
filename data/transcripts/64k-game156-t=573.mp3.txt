have you watched you with but it is still early so that's the theory for c o g now I just have to get it working in fact if it comes through as they pick the bands have begun got themselves their first from yesterday in the lot of that was a man who's going right there by piranhas ribbon and we'll see if yes yeah the one I like that that's why we're here to see if he left leave on the field jersey that is what he said as a League of Legends team by Hotshot GGthe inspectors I'm sorry next week you'll be available Love Goes by bird the overall met a little bit of the word Susan what's amazing to me is like we really hard to call dribble a minute later. Way more often. Because of how the magic would Rumble mid is almost Unthinkable in the LCL because it's a very powerful think we saw a little bit of time in the LCL karthus jungle is nothing santorin plans with insole of you has brought out briefly knows he has to be very limited success this is the this is a peony flame it stick say right now how about you play 83 down there this morning cast the bands have stayed fairly static throughout the week and aside from the odd like ribbon released in speaking into the band Tiffany support and just grab the Italian Senator oh yes she can be strong as support if I leave I am laying with Senna plus melee is the male ego and you threw everyone and the Damage most traditional following carries are Rave so you could almost never get the effectiveness out of your stomach you right on top of that it's like you can do other things put make it even harder for a daycare center tickets tolls make the items Killingsworth like his other Matthew things you can do to correct but at its core the design of the Q and so we have Sunday to carry with a tank support who is melee it makes it really does lineup for the current situation that we're in how they interact with fans right now I'm the only one support what rank is two up when she won with justify the ways you might see that band come through as well you don't you see Morganna off of p o e I wonder if but I wonder if they if a Victor become to catch syphilis right it's one of these best else yet Champs and it's one of crowns best chance of all time. These played it that much weight has rebuffed Victor where he doesn't get full man off of a like and it came up here to document even stronger and already consented Orton comes through at the Top Lane band Robert history I mean obviously he last year filled into the back door behind all the others but the friend of mine games back and forth to recycle does the Earth gain from back when it was all about playthrough darshan top of the top and getting a new one stress Victoria tootell asking you babyface the rubble but I will see what is always take out okay but Leona is better for Ignacio oh man crop in North America what's a hover board game today in 2020 you called it this is actually a kind of pics that she was really early on doing they were doing this halfway through dumbest play last year in finding lot of success with it so very good at playing the backup I think it'll Jets matter whether or not they can get him going and if they can't deal with the rest of the team had to get engaged off just like the rumble pushing to Rome borderline city of cellulose to the owner of Rex ice tub that's a lot of dangerous stuff going Bottom Line that could full weekly down there if we can get a dick no more stops all appropriate stuff to yourself and time it's down the final, to the coaches why do fat people for the game he was linked to play about he was really depressed and just licking playing time for handshakes and off they go with you to pick someone up looking forward to seeing you play actually so something that I find interesting about these Beauties is a lot of the ways that they will win is true teamwork rather than thinking hey here's an individual who's really going to hypercare like when he's been good it was like 10 Turin working with a team like teamwork Dory going through and likewise you were maybe saying it's Wiggly maybe saying it's ruined but overall it was very much around teamwork do based on preseason power rankings I had CLG at 4th and flyquest at 7 but there's a lot of variation between that cuz I'm thinking like black spots on their best day quit just be better than CO2 right because you're worried about if things go well it could be very good for them which is why I mentioned in this matchup his innocence they kind of both win the same way and I fell asleep or full of brambles kids. Pineapples in the back I appreciate that we'll see if you we can get him out of the champion very highly prized midlander in Pro play don't get much of North America are going to get here today as we get to play Airsoft over yes that is indeed about to do on a Philly yesterday. Liotta again just thought they were in the wrong order it did when they join the lobby it's actually ignoring Turtles fault and you know the graphics can account for player error not that hard ulcs order if not that's why you get right almost every time. We're jumping at a chance like 4 I think the game okay well as the players get ready to go to the lanes without too much of a skirmish happening going to have Gabby sit by with song for an interview thank you so much free I do have song here you are new to the organization so I wanted to get a couple quick thoughts from you first of all, and also knew but some are thinking about the Synergy that you and he may have so what do you make of his addition to the steam yeah I never work for you to call me in the past year but when I talk to to be the crown we are related to respect each other and we have a life similar strategy or the gaming knowledgeable there so we are really love and have each other if I right now looks pretty good for a mission of smoothie so thoughts on the bot Lane Synergy that can come from this these kind of support and then both guys really cocinar thing we're right now and even last year I want you to walk me to somebody because I know that she's tired and I came out of those plans so I also really love somebody to thank you they were play I thought fit to be a good-looking lineup for the squad and I will see if I can pick up the first one here gets wiped out today because of the history of Steel G like the teams that have been around even pre LCS you mentioned the 10 years of see OG Bali were one of the original members of The League nearly got relegated that one time they've had their ups and downs a 1/2 LCS titles they have banners hanging right here regulate body style that was a very iffy re-engage bi-weekly I'll give you the first jet sure Crown tried to help play it but there's no way that flash Paulo is going to work into a full house rek'sai and Rumple no big over reach there to make it go from bad to worse so first off good cake from Santorum you're expecting him to go for Scuttle crab that's why Crown is trying to step up Scuttle crab spots it's not there but I think happened to come to your room and says I'm here and smooth it says I'm coming to River and wimpy doesn't walk if you get away that's what he was likely thinking doesn't make it right I don't get enough. 3 seconds off Squad was not there for the follow-up infant turn around and that is too quick killed 1400 going to be early game I'll lick their wounds I imagine he's got some Farm that's going to be a long road back up oh yeah I wasn't changed in the offseason so still very valuable to pay on the map and I want to see if Dan touring can really get to leave here with the double longsword Advantage he has over Wiggly any type of fight he can actually find a jungle he will be strongly advantage GameStop man just imagine the match up with your pitbull dogs when you're already paid for the only one like okay maybe invaded take you can't play right now though pint or just on the farm game trying to push around them to you we there for the closest farm near a well it's worth noting that of course he is Flash list and so Jarvis if you can get behind At All YouTube a cat can turn to a bill is going to require some respect that a few we can appoint out a water jumpers jungle off of peace I think she has a jungler who definitely does the mask so last year he was one of the first junglers to highly prioritized broke because back then cruggs gave about twice as much experience as other major jungle camps now relatively Rob is the best temp to take yes and I think Santa is not going to be someone who takes a long time to optimize that has passed you going to do it right away so you can actually see if he did his grub just have all the way across the map there's actual Ward on weekly area so he's fully bought into trying to get this is going to walk over work here in Texas if your juul be here today has sucked down to this part of map of the first we know why you can't order second ago his situation is known and sits around waiting. Do u e n Rumble is level stick deflector take pics in through Wards are sweepers they also get rid of this vision I really real say yep I've got a recall got to go from this one is Raptors or back up clear those a little bit no gang I'd be happy but you can easily just go for the Drake generally knowing that people are going to be on a reset and uses that double longsword an adage to get likewise that really ocean break all of this is based off of his early game gang but still a good start for a flag of all junglers in the game he's in he said he often outfitting stores support in his games as well early sweeper got rid of that Ward and kind of Portofino Forest about laying back off the recall bit of Aries the ocean right grab so he is arguably out farming and he's got the global objective here as well and as long as I also find it interesting when junkers play against their former mid-length which is what happened because the mid laners to swap to write like santorin should be fairly familiar with how Crown plays the mid lane and likewise with Wiggly in Pardeeville so I think that's part of why both those jungles were drawn towards the Midland and this is probably reading too much into it but I also wonder like paid attention or notice the crown can always push up around shuttlecraft for like what is that something that was your weakness or strength of his right there's something clever about skipping over Scuttle crab to go for that gang yes it happened 4 and 1/2 minutes ago but it's still the most important thing happened so far in this game
