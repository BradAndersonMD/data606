if life has been one of their bright points and I think they should match up well against does liberty mean they have them pretty solid but they are looking to rebound here today and put it into their of losing ways against hundred deep I'll give it up come through as they start to fix and the Vans and it's almost every Academy team has a record that very closely mirrors or else yet they are a a screw-top squad overall contract has been a lot of time in the LCS are you trying to work back towards that so we have more teams that are willing to come try crazy stuff that are willing to be flexible and really kind of Swing for the fences movie times with you, right I thought the fighting so we'll see if I come through I do think I was going to support his is viable will be fun to play Maurice Moore think it's actually one of his strong points has come through from time to time there is the ability to punish those with John for the cops play more heavily for a plane and we just are coming off that easy game or without you being a booton dominating a claim against Israel and Brahms will be that first text that though and we do know it's he is flexible there is a possibility of it going you do multiple Lane deer could be jungle could be top but it is actually the first set play for fly Quest Academy this is what I get for them and that you really do I just bought land come through cuz you have a guaranteed heavy front line behind it very very good blue or red stripe draft grab all three Champions and you almost died on that a long time so he would give you some really strong engage this is Dad going to be the Nautilus we are built really really good engaged to one but still feel great gang set up do much lockdown in between their the passive roof know how old are knockoffs as well as your old clothes and stuff if you don't have a truck on you I am the vine you stuck there with no weights beef but yeah going to play one of the very few tech support said because he has played 10 sexy be more in the range component and so this one cuz I have like this we do I like just gonna say it is actually the first Nautilus pick so far this split so bringing out another your dad to his repertoire and lacity how he does do you want it but you will be able to be free for active on the champion and looking to settle allspice and they got to be able to follow up on that rather sell used to deal with all of that look pretty good in team fights without damage as deities and look pretty good as well when I dropped off or going to see what that kind of thinking of the consequence that is going to be expecting again top things that feel as we know it can move around to see if not if I put that I'm selfish expected Texaco through and now we got to wait to see what the visit is going to be and we can speak like Lipstick Jungle mid most likely everything you know is the closest Staples Tech not really heavily punished by many things that people are willing to play in the net of these days when people talk about I think it's really really strong we have this thing in some regions yeah it's coming out and especially with that want to go late and said one is not the champion to punch right this is not like you're going up against the lease in Oro off is going to be in your face and can be updating you telling you off in the early stages be able to scale be able to look for level six and try to get aggressive there okay later on is going to be potentially Affleck then we could see the Lucian talk to sure it did it is surprising to see like a blind Lucian mid that is why I'm thinking that it was 5% that tardos till mid set jungle play almost any combination of both lanes by pollution made with that top in front of the Jungle EP it comes in at Lucian most likely go set mid know if you want to start of a Fuse Top Lane know which is gluten in the atrox that you have to really early generally to have the same kind of exit their phones are going to ask it is looking like it will be in triple-fan but I do not have a tremendous amount of walk down after you take us to ligo and if the Casio is able to scale up and come to go even in this Lane that is going to look very very good for Toledo alright exciting stuff right here are you going to come and spend some more time look at his wife with composition because I think about engaged for this. It would be more reliable locksmith right there but they have a front line and they have a very aggressive back to the damage is there that BC is there was a damaged profile is there what if you're lacking magic but not be one that locks the damage profile this would look very very good I like the dropper fly but I think there's a lot of work really well here yeah I agree I think a lot of Frontline very heavy and gave us that money as well as a novice Casio NFL use your miktam is profile there for the scary looking to be able to follow up and have a few that fourth yeah I think if you know a lot of my eyes are really going to be on Lucian and carpet I do think you so much I've had this game is going to go is going to be depending on how they are playing if person gets way too behind in the earliest age you lose that magic damage and likewise if if Lucien is able to punish the Casio I do think can be tough have the same kind of effect is that Cassiopeia later on in the game where he has most effective against a lot of these Champions absolutely well we are the rest and we'll see who can take this win flyquest currently one game behind him to be only slightly different choice conquer on a philipssite end it because he talked more often said he should send to her ass to get the 3 Sniper out of pretty evenly but I'm not sure on the Fly Quest bot Lane set of used for the summoner's there is no night this is barrier healed Guardian right so that is about as defensive if you can get if you are looking to keep your marksmen player alive your mass in this case know if he is going to be getting engaged upon will have a tremendous amount coming through from that room as well as the double prevent stomach flu mean JJ's of course Very squishy if he does go in and I can always be a threat and Caspian grounds you at almost any range and we'll see how that plays out but otherwise nothing to Stellar happened to the game even among Champions like people like that you're a tank Garden seems okay again spoke but you don't lost a match answers even on loss of Mages it is actually very very effective knows the highest win rate on things like bar. Morgana even on Champions like Nana and Nani is often very high because it's so easy to actually have it apply to do anything with it for it to be effective and it really does help to deny a lot of potential all in family on you but on your Lane Apartment price yet so far we are from the very start here I can't leave the engage nice roof there and freeze gets damaged across did you first walk backwards the wave is pushed it looks like a little XP was west side and they hire a wave here and get level two dropping a few more csunity has missed about 3 Fri Mistress of the way she sees guys are going to trade back and forth between Emily and Potions are pretty nice it is going to be phased by sheer force him to do so about Cassio in Lane that can be very important you're playing at The Crest Lane really is mad at me because you have the ability to read incredibly powerful eat when you are standing up that's when things really really strong but you in the early level it's also very easy if you're a bit over aggressive with it and kind of sustained by someone like a Lucian is cuz you never really outperformed you if you do run out all right now it's the power clear to get the actually a to Camp lead right now for the cards which is really at expectation to be on drugs by 3 minutes and you're not going down another engaged on the bottom side just I'm just back in town and not easy being done right now for Sasha to eat already fully cleared anchor gets them away still supposed to land fanatic very comfortable here and that should mean that they will be able to grab that top side Scuttle and again I mean this is kind of the power of Carthage New Jersey 3rd broccoli by D I forgot to find the route they could go to the flashcube but even need those flashes us know what is your flash that late first plug comes through for contract through with the past Andrew from Nautilus ajwani coming through Mashpee The Flash toy earlier than that failed to do so and then once he was already essentially guaranteed to die while he waits both talked about how they're setting up to have every advantage to try to survive with barrier he'll Guardian everything they use it all and they still life Honda Frisco zip up the topside potatoes across the farm is a crop Farm fanatic get that go from ended up get that XP take over this game and it's bedtime you know even shopped yet but have you done the man is back to group now has the camps to return to write he did outside. All them look for a gang and then Retreat back towards the jungle. A lot of protein looks like to talk about is pressure and then Farm you know new go look for that many countries back mashka took here has decided will that very clearly earlier really does not get them again cuz you know he used to come through and then it expired beer getting flashes out does go down so pretty poorly time Summers on both accounts honestly from Mash that is the same with barrier you know he'll you just press it and it does something for you beer has to be timed with the incoming damage to get the most out of it through this could be good breed to get a Ghazt the anchor wait to see it then. Have a good life. Games I could have been scary equal far right now in the middle and basically is not stop anybody back and forth Revenge season 4 Shots across Nolte's opiates are ya this can be a tough matchup for a chocks especially for Leon set really does love to ball with these types of Champions it's kind of more days Rock the chunks where you down and talk you down as you get more CVR no reliable moved all cast but if it comes straight to Autos usados in that regard next Avengers when his lame-ass shop is doing a good job brawling up at a farm there but elsewhere it's obviously quite nice the first Blood kill the bottom line through the use by good yeah that's a big one good thing also happening first legal here in the mid lane really not very far behind as far as the Cs Department goes to see it already bass triple has not got the full to your by which is a really big amount of gold to be able to hit there for Casio does relief so many of your man problems then officially looking good too much done and because you have spots on their plan do the oldest TV that it should be able to be set when he got you have a lot less if you are getting pretty good at that one if you want it's not quite that so far deal with a second recall grab Cordova components plus he has not been out for my contract score right now some of that response time has been left to languish and pink and white work for the carpet and tile contractor to clean the board look up his Mountain Drake so far so good. Lisa pushed it back the $100 I mean you have the Nautilus you have his money was going to be some cuz it says built up between those two campaigns for sure and then I'll be asleep some smaller amount going to be gave me to buy atrox and some of the other Champions butt down here in the arms race both guys dancing very heavily on the early game trying to have that power and it also makes you so much more difficult to Ashley all in on when you do have all of his phone as hell from the Thorns Idaho where is the turret damage stuck on the cross the two plates taken down first one Breezy very well down here
