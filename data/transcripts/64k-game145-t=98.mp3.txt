before so we'll see if they can keep that one up and now we are in a Champions like to see if that can continue on or if they move up to five yes oh dig just one at 4 and 3 to move into 11 or 11 and 3 need a frosty or not the best not the best action most wins as you know de lis brackets updated so far against the north who has been very aggressive totally right about that lot of jungle bands coming out from the sides PSM speaker has had some cereal moment so far in Academy games there is one really epic moment early on in the season if you haven't even highlight where he jumps into the Elder Dragon pit bulls against Yale Academy kickz mikeyeung out of the pit as we cinnamon secures the Elder as his team just like Elder nuke everyone down stay out of steel just one of the most epic League of Legends moments I've seen from a perspective jungler overall is because third pick of the year on it yes call it really game jungle to make action happen oh no in Ori I can't get to play Jarvan so on paper not terribly contested as a champion you know they could if you want to win you should play Soraka really heavily Nerf than 10.4 which is a good thing in moments like tuaca liqueur what do I expect a protein to do like do you put games in on Soraka to get the two weeks of Victory or do you just try and like for ject what the nerves are going to be eventually and that end up scaring people away from the pickets is one of the reasons that like some more play in the lck this week even though they're on patch 10.2 because they're already practicing it for 10 Tree in these games are like no longer wave his self I Can See For The Academy guys at least unless you're specifically trying to prove like his look how quickly I can learn strong stuff would just say actually I don't expect this to be a long day something so I'm not going to stay strong even still look like a ridiculous Place Rocky forever in trouble who dropped you know below viability yeah until people you know they're fat 120 in Misfortune to pick up I think that's a really excited when I definitely a lot of kills right here King and diamond diamond in the car with the last year and a half or so and I had a very good year do you want to see him coming to the 440 is having a player remote valleys vet right you're not next to your teammates the things I've been through the fire but not having a good you were coming off his best game though against Evil Geniuses this week he had an affiliate game where he went 5-1 11 Stow Kent Flea on an upward trajectory he's got a decent Lane like diamond scratch has been really good in the past has been absolutely do not want it so far this but that's not always there at the vans come through or seeing next pretty Carrie band down there the Camille dropped off as well and will be I want to grab Top Lane or mid lane first and then yeah that is likely what we would see happening when I'm trying to think like there's a reason Tinder is high priority and often to end of Tuesday would pull out of camp that Joey is available is something she won with really is a tweet so far he's seventy-eight championship games I want to see I want to see me and just keep stuff going so that I can go though with the Camille's and they they go for the 8 show when you ban Camila. The effect of match of counters though they really want the atrox I don't think they cancel XSport fit but they thought I was going to grab a joke so they are they wanted to get him off of champion 3/4 stupid Orkin already gone so it's like Gangplank as last one left a lot of stuff being denied so far in the draft likely toppling pikir not the easiest person to be into dope GP app you let out the choices she's going to really pull into a back pocket do stuff like you're not allowed hey man I think I'm bored I'm bored too but it's not it's the Gangplank and now Cloud 9 get the double check in maybe it is sick afterwards so you mentioned it yet so the streak ends for Palafox Champions at 8 game I thinking about overall like both teams have a good spread of damage both teams have a different damage profile between the jungler and the mid laner which is actually pretty important when you're thinking about how the Elaine Chui Chui will work definitely a bit of a push advantage on the top side for the atrox early but there's a quick dented for the various Nautilus on the bus side CSM so I could match up right I don't necessarily won or lost Raptor has these fatal flaws to kind of followed the basics because he's very reliable in Gatesville unreliable as your best bet and not diamond is very good don't get me wrong but that is a very narrow window pain where is Flash is going to connect until I think he's been a little bit more reliable internships as well I'll see if I evolve can make that one happened here as well do you think the better record so far in the academy. Have began Academy traditionally has been dominant in the academy seen in part of seeing eyes off these and they did end up making a lot of moves with depleted their depth between the LCS TEAM Academy Rochester is known for being able to develop top talent from last night and picked up one of The Replacements and it looks pretty good for him so far and we'll see how well they can build their next year's at stars we got ourselves a man Cloud Nine's Academy squats I don't hear we were at the same as well no offense or something yeah yeah yeah yeah glad to have ya got it took me like way to find a Kenny at 1 that one was way for those two and then it was just a little slow today which one is it that they have it so that's a very smart person 115 statements he will deliver like you serious but he doesn't mean it and I never know if I didn't act like research are you destroy everybody and and you're often wrong when is often wrong when trying to reach at the inside check is like too difficult my most memorable story of this is educated guess and this is definitely a bragging I'm going to say is I know what you're doing yeah people ask what the origin of 7-Eleven was the one and I was just like oh it's because the stories to be open from 7 to 11 and now it's 24 hours and like it has never changed the name that's true. You must be true it's just like the lck school of plastic just believe that you say you're the best and Reddit is going to go with you cuz they're silver this one do you have any pre-game so we can let us being played in timing is a graph of the bottom line for TSM stuck at level one down here here comes to walk up flight or the Whoop That Trick that was really interesting normally Nautilus hook-like overpowers NEC see if there's an extra pulled out from the thresh hook that I really can't stay u c o i a Persona I burn all the time could you catch the brake pressure special getting hit by the Cure. You know a bit of distance build-out did you die or flies and thoughtful to come again they denied that's so free like you can't miss this good job 60 Gold urn I mean I'll take that every time yeah we heard more we was so cool that for me can't go for it I feel like there is Nautilus should be a powerful Lane so I don't know exactly what happened in before really face and made them get pushed off on the early levels in like the GP with his coaching Master start I can see that pushing inside a little bit but now I think that's how often should be going back just remember chance like I was like oh yeah it's fashion Jakob to happen right now so if there's any kind of figure out what I have ended up I think in order to get me fat bottom side but it did any time you're late for the lane and if it is always there's and just like his place out there both teams are playing appropriately you give us a second place so you got to be like absurdly started if you want you to not make that happen as though that's just the price I ask you one more time. I will kill him in speaker. Solve for first what was waiting for the job in eq2 Flash and lost just killed him while he was waiting Contender flashes not even eating to be you still there is the fairest of the game power coming through as well stay out of jungle it yeah so I mean they know that they have Speed Carbon on the way and it is basically a bait right after shock is down for Diamond so lost and just kind of move towards me as much as possible as you mentioned the flash food truck down like diamond but if you burn flash for that damage if you could then would have to save to be able to get the CC and kill him just a good run down gang lots of pretty safe early recall gets The Vamps after and we can move on as we wait to see what the next big play Heroes most one really softly and pushed Okla it have counterpick on the match if it looks really really want his hand and now we have diamond looking to Rome in the Middle Lane but free what when's the new Hunters way too much of Cloud 9 and Teresa's running the big Polly had a truck on to get away yeah good arena in their buy C9 evolved thought the cleanse was going to be enough to get them away but ended up just being way too much damage as well so it really good romantic made that also talk over the cloud nine now and very successful love Simon to room over there what is against oh yes they got a minute yasso not answering the questions here are the lanes that I expected to be winning ended up getting pushed in but then still generated kills yeah right because they end up the gate comes and then it happens but you're right man Jeff understand airpush detector one of the only times where I hate the other team is pushed why isn't the jungle here cuz I can fly but you are pushed in the other team isn't like this actually dangerous but not when two people to stop one more time. Of you yeah you have to but behind you and then flash later since it was already down but he's dead yeah yeah yeah in 4k going to be a lot of wind power can be locked out of the hall in that champion
