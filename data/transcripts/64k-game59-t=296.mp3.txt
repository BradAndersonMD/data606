because if they get back to form their went to the best team in North America and and that's the question is does cloud nine ever come back to becoming Cinderella if I could ever go back to that night and no teeth at Spring split team if they show up again better watch yourselves North America take your heads but if not if they stay at this level you know yeah it's like they can fall as far as 4th I believe for their seating in the postseason they nearly tossed but not even be in playoffs replacing seal to hear this to be another really close game and and I mean it's going to take your confidence and you've got about six days to turn things around be ready to go as soon I don't get that first round bye they have a 5 days going to run before the first round last in some cases pending on on which day to apply on stuff will see you soon I can do it again or better than TSM to get that second seed over all those teams are tied at 12 and 5 and TSM please Team Liquid later they would be a tough one will see what happenedmake all the sense in the world C. W with that pic and I really do like the red side Caitlin banned from teams not allowing birthday Caitlin to go over anymore cuz it's it's such an easy strategy to try and utilize where you have Caitlin flood you know some long-range support duties that could be one way to allow the other teams can get the hours for Caitlin and immediately pick up the first round of the listed here on the side of Cloud 9 on Boeing that with a very aggressive jungler in grave clobber has not had Graves game from he had not also had to delete games either previously and champions for the early game Power farming and with glad I'm now sitting there for Autumn side up with one of those vents Des Champions one of the Champions do we associate him with even from his origin days at the very beginning of his careerbefore he even changed his name Calista has been one of his most outstanding pics and that could be a lot of bottom side play making for them on the side of see OG though they're just walking in on Tuesday another comfortable control May cheer for the mid lane and the scaling side of it with the ability of sand bottom is very very interesting has fallen angels to Fair bit still decent win rate in Pro Play Still seen occasionally but I was he with the nurse no longer that top prize on The C9 side seriously missing from lavish camping for I thought it fit the scene on Spotify. I thought it was a player I'm going to be picking it up here also I'm happy to see C9 playing for early aggression to get the early games know about going into trying to Crush the game in 25 I think C9 I think they're going to try to return the form by holding in a style I think it's something like that and I want to see what else they pick around it and discpick their Champions close the top unlikely so possible on a boulder is play top link but now we are the second Tuesday exactly they don't want to get killed pressure for jet ski go back to their style of Rome style Champions you know it's things like Echo things like Twisted Fate even where he can support this aggressive bottom line Focus that they've got a raise already locked in that could very easily be them trying to play around that bottom side back up dragons early as a win condition of trying to get to that stole meanwhile we have seen the return of players practicing a call he's ever since it was played by the closer with a z in the lck SKT for for Faker so I I knowit hasn't been played how much on the rift and we decided yesterday with Jensen for Team Liquid but I know for a fact that a lot of the Soul winners have been putting timing it on it in practice with that band out this key back on his Zoe it's it's not the Super aggressive mid lane Champions but quite good at roaming with the extra W speed and safety that you can get from picking up Summoner and provide you a lot of potential to set up and supplement Graves invades I want to be Aleister Alistair as the last pick you up or scale to see it a lot but he got buffed if you have to go he's actually very good in toothbrush overall it is an absurd amount of Frontline it is a lot of meatballs and it's there for orianna NFL pixelated and if there is a key that works here it is a bunch of bad damage on the 9th with Lane that if you can survive and scaletake the team fights to see if there is a way out on the way in I like this traffic and do it Cloud 9 for this before a licorice but I think this is smart as well and things like will have a field day from get to a Checkers 1st and set up at them so they can try and force Cloud 9 to funnel to them through small areas and you can get off all of your AOE bottom line Focus freaked it is out of control on topside ultimate down bottom start out 1 2 3 going for 9 they should be forcing plays around that side of the map even with the Alistar pick I think it is it is definitely the area of focus for that so I wanted to keep very closeattention to blauers first game on graves how he's going to pass early now focused on at bottom side Scuttle crab to start that out with the early vision and even try and get some deep rewards on to the enemy camps because CLG if you mess around and you give this comp over some money that isn't insane AOE Wombo Combo Bourne ultimate Alistar ball Delivery Systems it's definitely has possibilities here at Fort CLG sealed be drafting is very heavy team fight and I cannot fault in Fort again I like this draft a lot a lot of the magic look good they tried to protect the Oriana feel safe is he goes down to Zoe which should be handleable and now CLG on the map looking for some early information to know what kind of Pop Labyrinth is taking on the Cloud 9 side been going to be over team fight focused Keystone lethal Tempo and hail of blades are by far the most common on Calista Hale really good for crushing Tulane to get three out of the pastso a bit of a lake in Fairly standard things on his side all right now as far as my desire for a level one invited we did at least have the recall for bladder to switch over to a sweeper so maybe they can go for a delayed invade sweep as they're going in they might find something maybe so many bladder is leading the way looking to spot out where a board might be always exciting to go toward kill with your Mater top winter nearby about the damage talking to be too much maybe get 625 Mana for manastone is exactly what I want to see with the graves pick the delayed invade you switched over to the sweeper it gives it away they seal the way the Red Bluff a lot of people when they see Graves they think oh it's the Marksman jungler you've got a scale of your farm oriented you should be played very aggressively in the early stages trying to use your range advantage to form a lot of enemy camps rather than your own is going to be a few laid single start gear for Progress they did have the ward on the Red Bluff over and with the movement there from Tuesday he cited out the invade flapper going to try and head straight red to red. Volibear on the way out split sleeper volibear though Top Lane pushing and maybe they kept a little scent of him here. Just going to be an extra Fort Bragg us as well as a unit bottom 1459 helping out a little bit with ladder just taking a look at how that whole thing kind of started out because it was really interesting it's like okay I know it looks like a jungle pathing plays out I got to get to read ASAP to get that for gets stolen and then well I'm crazy but that's clear I can take to camp and then secure my own top jungle it'll be fine I'll be there before the others it's a Viber gets a full actual Camp lead every jugular wants chicken need to get to is easy to kill or drop it was going to be left up anyway that's not really much of a seal in fact that we spawn higher-level with some like chickens that you actually get that as as gold difference yeah early on they don't like it as much until you get like your body center for the Haley explosion and then Yuri on top of it and you just love it and just blows up the camp butts grave could do any camping the entire game and take almost no no damage. So he's happy to get that away lover also left behind a couple of small ones so you to your concert shuffling Point fully delays the respond of that camp so it won't return at a higher level and practice with machete start of course looking for more action rather than a farming so liquor is going to be the or just come in though and I got a flash the way licorice survive the to be one dive getting a flash of the ruin the process and a good job holding on to his W there there's not a amended amount of surprise vs. damage that can come out from a volibear orange both of them being level four and three so licorice seats saved his guilt of a last-second fill he's very low value out of it they cannot take Lipitor at any longer and Flash blown by Seals be in the attempt to dive and licorice comes out of it unscathed alrighty comes out OKC LG audio 800 gold leader Leon did Layne is getting flat spot Lane getting clapped a fair bit as well with the far left to grab this won't be a full 13 PSD in actuality BBC yes a v a hundred fifty gold difference in mid as recess come through for both sides just getting out lane straight up we knew his ladies that's where we can Academy still came through with the wind sell more of a mid-game can you buy flyer but sealed he already has problems the early game than not getting any better just yet it's a gold leaves tips if it's fraud yeah and Oriana picked a lot for our leader game utility as well liquor is filled up with double waves here but there is no present from lab or anything to come for a dive or press him off so it should be able to pick up most of it and actually pull ahead of his BS benefiting from the Christmas in quite a quite a few on the dive and ensuing teleport back a lot of things already coming out to the dragon though for champ select are they said that should be the clearer Focus from 59 callista to just believe that bottom side then and Vulcan for some riding to the power they reset for is there a recall for the first items first time you get your boot upgrade here for it's been so you get your. Speed and then they can easily take the dragon with a Beretta very quick Pace that's what they want to do get their soul as quickly as possible by a bladder already has a full ten camps done counting the Drake there's the flash tops liquor still have to go to the charge doesn't pack have to do that afraid of Flash's long-term put something you can't be twice and honestly by one we take those are the Lakers playing the the weak-side really well I guess if he's going to come make it a strong side just fans going to attack is exhausted not quite asleep at his place is nice try buddy you put up the camp top play let me show you the top link gate goes and misky get that team first what do you have to roaming this to you once again strikes while we're going to make sure Tuesday doesn't get a cancer play moving down towards the bottom side and see if I can do anything about the actual counters don't going Tuesday does have open available another look at the top winners by the way have at least like three or four of their remotes to set as the camping remote that is at once again swing-and-a-miss licorice just eats the orange trades flash for flashing deck and then you see at the meeting up right here? Makes up the river so that is sealed case and whiskey could be roaming up and yes they still have sprockets clearing the control word in the river this is one of the most common I like to write I really felt the the excitement with that one too yeah I can play on topside I just want to dive into it even more cuz that is something I see in a lot of solo queue games to with junglers that will go for their game and after they get something off their gank they're not really thinking about the rest of their opponents and very clearly CLG and pain progress were just Meandering down there killing off the canal ward in the brush with the? Teams also going down to the communication either not strong enough for like hey get your ass out of there or the timing was just off because I call you know so we just left either way Cloud 9 have kind of stepped back up to the type of way that we saw from them when they were at their most dominant it is aggressive fiber playing off bottom line pressure and then Misty also running around HealthSouth licorice we playing the weak-side quite effectively in a game by a whole lot they don't have a slight 15 minutes that got it in half the time right now I'm curious what the next 7 look like over the wall Fulton baby seals with the guy had flash I accept the auto tag coming in Gold come to the Cloud 9 and 2 it's about to be attacked yeah you like that is my kill you're welcome for the room
