second biopsy come out front when I take with you really are you really as a party with Alistair adorable it's fun to see if he's like really scared of Aurelia okay 10 seconds for Cyanide to get his second ban in those you just joining us were not familiar with Hutchins draft works you can see it on the screen what the picks and Bans are there is another Taco Town Carthage sew-in in race games especially play you have Noble exclusive pick wear it once you pick the champion YouTube can I take it someone to fix Caitlin it's locked out for the team that is inclusive you can never have it take to get Champion the second thing is you actually ban Champion sleeper team right here Alistair Rumble Twisted Fate a ReliaCard this cannot be pasted by either team generally speaking that means you park at them at the enemy team that you target car thing to do if you can't lick our heads we don't really care because I know big Dino skin of our teeth needle another Target have a name. So as I think he likes to straight band thing but in other parts has player so I end it through those players of those strong Mage types that are the champions so yellow star has the first pick any right now I think it is going to be the giant take right here it's all right I should be neutralized by Van I think I should be anemia so I guess I'll be handed over Foley yeah I need a double Majors actually fairly common lineup toy Sandy you a bunch of a tank done with the entrance of movie when you were both available you can have a tank junglers workouts of the pics I don't think for one lane due to any hilarious if they did but I don't think it's going to happen but it isn't so quickly because I was talking with your Eskimo one of the same thing like why was your first pick of me because you wanted the enemy team last pick Nunu and those are both seem to be the common like high pick junglers does tank junglers they fit so well of every line up his breakout control and Game King and his kind of fat and ugly, and fixed and you've been letting the enemy team like pick a very late bfp jungler and not really worrying about the fact that you know you care about getting a human being picked up that buy Kuja it off as well as having the second of the football player repair Canon booms they have two big Tanki guys now in front and have the support in the jungle locked into they have a wealth of Mages or wealth of rain JD I want to support watching us before some pick up a terror to really think is going to pick whatever they want to know Ray J D's have been banned out a shipping taken but for key Misfortune vein those are all available and was immediately stopped up by epic Gaming in in the last time you saw between them and AAA and he was like open Clash of cool but the Dana. Was like hi how they contended pick up really cool to see these lyrics I'll smash out where these bands are not bands you would see for the most part of a North American play oh yes thank you so much Captain Teemo is on duty and for those who watch the North American Qualifiers I'm sorry I am I'm sorry it was late I've been gassy for two days straight Tilly's cuz I have last time they have a freaking Timo and it's bad just because honey badger team oh yeah you know I would do men on him and follow him around the entire game and I'll get yelled at on the Forum I would really but neither of those actually the last serious either and I don't listen to get it for him we see again a chain of flashes down and do not know who this is the ice cream away and killed one person lineup is a great team comp is is Ash most of the teams they have an asteroid shoot across the map hit someone anivia walls and got his faults in the entire team has pushed back and got completely separate it out it's a free Tale As Long Range lineup because Champion like like John I feel like it okay to push you away so you stay safe during doesn't line up to the tops are going through looks like a AAA picking up gragas got Mom with a mage going to pick me up a Nivea so he was the last time I go again on Stone of this time again juggling the same as got new new garages ignite flash through the proper mid over here over here on the other side we got sign it if I juggling with your Mumu mommy is Zealot play Misfortune Misfortune pick twice in a row here and he's on his European teams for the carry choices brand his his brand new to this tournament the great maze price great. He contended an enteric is my purple there was a four-time really going to affect him every time he sees you as well I'll see you guys at the new told him I would go out with the amazing spectacular the teams do get a little bit of time after they finish their that pic to office they change that ruins get a master reset open on some Soca little bit about how the game's going to give us a few minutes to get for that we've got about 40 seconds left field to go this one from the ponds and pick so we've got right now who you looking at 2 I'll be at you now in this one night I I really like your boys lineup I like I found him only seen at work I've never seen it fail so so that they hate Mobility pick across from across than that really cool lineup I ended up letting his absolute zero you know ice arrows in Panay via the crystalling you know if it's really cool even if I from that mean while I mean it's really you know brand is very fiery I'm going to stop at the pump now cuz I'm really Rancho Verde okay but seriously very very a we line up here from fanatic they've got that idea for the team either of those work really well both with and against Carolina he has no other 80 Champions on his team at all and it's from from AAA is really all about dragons and Olivia and has some damage but everyone else on the team has like straight like strong AP damage so so is regardless but that does happen a little bit quieter liking someone who's not going to go to wait a little bit but he said he knows that is awesome again but they have a really want a wheel on a 3 and Vladimir Rush that team fight for their there's there's a little bit of Islam dispersion with brackets but it's not that same level of a real fight but we are not going to the game to the lights that are so the next game AAA fan. Again after 2 minutes all right in here we are so what do you think about this time I finally found the position before going straight down Middletown insoles at fault and not too dissimilar hanging up towards the top area Fanatics jungle at this stage Ellie wrong and they are going to maybe stop moving me so could you buy three year olds get their Vision not your Linux just dropped the one more that he bought in The Fairly aggressive position just by the bush at the race and fantastic still sticking around down by that Palm River area that down some old Glue on all towards the against all authority Blue Area still no real fight scene I don't think we've seen the clairvoyants I'm not Clairvoyant score against all authority on Melton deep are not sure if they really gone aside from it each other yet to hear from play some kannada crossed over towards the the Wizards have the map will be fine. I went to a camp in this brush really on here and say okay if you come too aggressive spiders Golem who did spot you and jump on you and get the drop you got you know a muumuu Sun Terrace Sun in Branson lot of damage output gladimir got the best level and probably what's a good pool if you needed it for that fight but I looks like yep that's not going to get there Golem safely looks like not even going to get much help down there that we go and if you will come to lend Italian not really a hand so much and going to going to push that Golem out pull that Heather. Never get it if you damage output there's a nice little crystalline shot they're going to be fine and you got Caracas was Vladimir up top and a Nivea versus brands of Fire and Ice in the mid I'm going to keep that one played after this tournament is really probably one of the biggest I think they were two major robberies in this tournament and they're in the same group that it is AAA worth of fanatic and it's teal G versus Team Solomid and it was really going to be the major I think rivalry that it really going to be a lot here that that I think the crowds don't really want to see I am in this to the to the giant overtones of any risky you and how good it southeast Asia was that a lot of really cool story lines going on in this tournament and right now it is Fire and Ice and I'm okay with that one right now Anna and Middle St Medina, as I mentioned before and you qualify as playing a very very solid and if your game in that Middle Lane and chew she's going to try not to put some early pressure down there I'm not sure maybe a little bit of fresh at we saw a rat lamia closest play me supposed to turn off his HP remaining in that one Ramallah vastly the jungles or at least a moo moo car in about his regular promise when you do go back home and pick yourself up some boots that's funny that you really do want to get fat people pee on you knew he is one of the best gaming junglers but you can rely on landing at school if I have to get the 152nd cool down cuz you have minutes of of not super super safety and he's back and really give you a giant first appeal if you can give you a full help that's it and then pressure on in Mid going to hurt pretty bad you need to know about two-thirds health unit Minden of you putting up that ice, do some nights damage and it worked pretty well but so far no major gains strides end of the car when it comes off from Tarak going to watch for that jungle do this is to be there as soon as that video is not going for the right going back into his own jungle Denny's in in in in a good place to ski or going to recall back they know that you do as far as I can see the rest of the land so he is safe to recall that was based not let me sell it for that we will fail are getting really really low here in a cell has does still have ignite up and flat ticket first about 300 health so it's going to be pretty close to the Belle cam. PK well. That one sorry that we will pay little dogs that one of them keep getting that one wrong unfortunately but I'm getting pretty welcome to be coming back in about one getting lower and lower and super annoying right now to find out if I level 4 has a philosopher's stone has those two Ward that's a really good for the team to drop one right they're going to spot maybe not right there I'm Ron Kittle or farther down I guess you do staying relevant do in this fight hasn't clairvoyants signal not push it too hard on to Brand looks like I'm going to drop her work is going to get behind so that's honestly make me uneasy when he went in to try and put some fresh ones as well as even money threw up on his truck is waiting on some Minion down and talk me into Yellowstone only 56 Health remaining on well it was a nice aggressive. Matt Kuchar but didn't quite have that damage output, he's still hanging around there though I'm not going to be a little bit I'm not going to be very dangerous for me, as well as he's actually going aggressive that is not a man until we are here in what else can they do so as showing up looks like they're not doing a whole lot there drop by so as once more start with a decent you like an idiot legs so what's going on and then we caught up so apologies there but yeah I play this game with from mistakes where you know Ash turn back around a pipe Misfortune and died when she got away and it was it was pique or we will fail are actually failing and rocking back into that are all but somebody's playing a wonderful game right now
