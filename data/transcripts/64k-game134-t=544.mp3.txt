anyway we got a game going Cloud 9 and flyquest the two top of the split ever gone undefeated TLC at the cloud nine or more than halfway there black West those but hey dignitas you and me where they come downstairs this week this weekend incredibly excited for this match up Ciara flyquest have been climbing up the ranks of the power of evil a lot due to ignorance so it supports as well as big Lanes prices going to be so far from there so I know how that goes through and as voted by the audience awaydefinitely strong a number three in a list of popular for blind taking Four Tops died and can be Flexin To The Jungle which I think will be here for Cloud 9 but so many top laners I thought you really liked the atrox side of the set match up because the control that you get me to Winter range in which with your uncle - though that's the immediate answer here for Black Widow big fries and he has not yet places near put a lot of his back when he was on TSN the last two and Tompkins goes alongside upstairs with lock into the bottomlands. TK away from there it would be a blast into the bottle and when he retireddefinitely classic for him do what kind of engages you can get the bottom line itself definitely difficult to diagnose full of Arkansas if they decide to have a struggler come on down and I really had a definite drunk as we talked about fluid Flex with that there though so just be a possibility he might be our on 10.4 we are on a new patch jungle take to come through I'm thinking to get what I mean by this weekend I'm thinking you're wrong. We are also getting some fancy to a power if you've always talked about how big of a turkey with such a big Champion for them last week by Adele. Tremendous amount of damage be able to win them that she's right around there and so good been there by Cloud 9another actually feel we focus band that still lasts and wait for counter-offer rumbles out there call t o e v Champion classify him as a player they're not looking at things are like with long e on IT band out here looking at Stats overall overall we need to Champion we all do that all the time and all the time right now for the right here on this side no sense whatsoever the other side here but is very poor flyquest normal-looking draft the ribbon could you tube and a wave I've never used to play that champion at least it wasn't going to look good 59 you always look at their mittens jungle combination they do have to Mid right now for dick you will be more difficult but with the AC locking here for Dragon it does open up the possibilities here for Nifty going 80 I thought Midland movie theater blind note as the pants will get locked in let's be still has quite a few option syndra is still available still available I didn't like how they played with it when he did have a guilty though it's also known for other long-range mazes but there's a danger that we mentioned it as well overall it looks pretty good. Give us a charge of the top when the government of suspected I think they're heading onto the roof with a with a decent chance here nobody with any heart in to hear nobody with any you do math without scale either will play there's not a ton of amazing targets right away so sometimes it looks like looks can be difficult we know Tom Kent likes to pick into simpler if I can afterwards that you can save it but I think there's some real life with you as well can be here also remember has the lowest dual proximity of all support in the ALCS that means you roam simos so definitely look for this blitzcrank to go get tools on other lanes times burn Summoner spells for the rest of the team down and do it. The bus that way and I'm looking to see the blitz Frank coming to bed pretty early on we're here for the trees see if they can do it. Show this year alone in second place is a great return before we're happy about Mother Nature all the above. Find the most this season as he is a kill leader on Fly Away Cloud 9 have absolutely been on a stair this with 10 and 0 so far fastest game time highest KDA best stats across the board for this team thanks God that he would Curry and we have got the flyquest chance behind us a big match for you going to get the number one team Cloud9 tell me how do you prepare these players for a match like this isn't too much different from what we normally do and I'd like to know they're just not a team we just make sure that we have the grass that we want and the job that you want to play and I were just ready to go sure there another team but they're the number one team on top of the rankings there has to be something that added into that preparation more than anything make sure that we're just not scared I think we play until it seems like really confident and playing them so maybe you can see there might be a little more hesitation because they're so decisive. Just make sure that our confidence is there but I think it's a team we're really gotten ourselves in our place also we're ready to go up thank you and best of luck to you back for you guys thank you thank you Carrie for the words as well stay confident Don't Be Afraid Cloud 9 so good in the early can they'll have absolutely smashing North America this year with early pressure by the cross the border don't think they have any sort of innate Advantage as far as the Champions going for these early duels either so like what should have at least amount of time to get set up here doing some side clear Red Bluff into cruggs keeping his options open as far as where to go probably not going to focus on ganking for and asriel X Kenshin Vulcan in a van moving up very quickly though I'm happy to take a hook if there's going to be one there's a full day very much cuz it's alright we also have a top-down clear for santorin heading towards a half of the map Lisa and off of red Raptors trying to get to his level three see what his options are going for power we've also taking the climb. In the Midland vs. Zoe Force injury in case he does fall prey to H4 Bubble at gragas combinations can you wondered and if you grabbing me provel first pick up Piper liquor during Battle of here this morning to grab should be pretty close in far but licorice temporarily down and help keep mines that has done so it's not going to be a big deal as far as what they want to do any early games to hear 4 by Feist to I definitely want to try and play office was Frank show me what the only number 5 most annoying Champion shame on you lie Community especially for junglers get the first average there I mean honestly what are you doing get this do a q with Smite first day of and you also have a slight advantage to the academy team and this key just prancing around like nothing's wrong trap on the ground from Santo and because bottom weight has priority though you can see the move up to the river are going to secure staff at here for bladder for Cloud 9 Steamworks wow send gold share for both of them feels another sweep or my bladder nice last heading there for Vulcan for CVS on the board at the scale goes over bitching about this in Bay two is that we were looking at possibly trying to make something happen in the bottom Lane off of its blitzcrank that has ignite you know trying to get a kill on De Volcan on the time Kent is a possibility if you can't delete the game down bottom side because Vulcan fan positioning very aggressively far up and they can try and pull something in but because of the invade we have to work down there since when has to go top instead the first knock up a damaged flag control that he doesn't have a damn it just be on the way over to another Romeo from this key but I can't get there in time and flyquest right first first what I mean when they have their big rise last year in Spring flyquest top or team santorin was blamed really really well he's back out there getting conversion for the team that being said flaperon gragas part farming and it does have eyes level lead plus has been able to go back for the Predator food so happy we got this Replay have to keep your eyes on the Grog Ascent touring here classes in for the level 3 get to slow down critically first so he does not get the Q. Sometimes these people just threw out the sonic wave yeah but he's a guarantee that killed and they had to guarantee a quick because of the room from this dude that was called from power of evil to some good communication and presence of mind their flight was thinking about the timing on their gig as we said okay your eyes on bladder he's got to be level five on progress went backwards Predator boots recall an offensively blown flashes can be punished just as effectively here by Prince Antoine both plastic for it to try and get that body wash makes patch and shouldn't have any escape this key over the top cloud they will get it good job there to talk about punishing that flash they do so stand for in because they reveal themselves on the top side though trying to start up this objective if they can actually get anything finished up here Dragon does take quite a while for 4 I'm out in roaming back down Focus heading over to Ward it at the moment spotted Now by Santorum Borden actions last cones away is it going to be able to pick up their controller to the pixie we have to make sure and Wells black let's get away with First Blood bubble Farm but I could only get here for like 1 also because of the ramifications of that Top Lane counter here no pushing the wave in for licorice on the debt definitely right back on his be feeling very nice about the current state of topside set especially for the early stages year with the Bramble vest trying to get some healing reduction on aatrox very early in the game does solidify this area is a map for them and now we got to keep our eyes on this key so you can see how much they're investing into the wards in the river on topside to allow him these possible Rome she keeps on pushing in midlane he's not losing out on information out of Cs to go over this able to get harveyville at his power First Central though it's a big spike on level 6 as far as the one we want no son is a little early so he's going for their but ignores not here nice by step by new Walking Dead comes back alive it up and help the power people there you go for this dangerous done on where Zoe started her are from not able to get this done means that they're not going to begin eating out of that game because nisky really nice footwork dodging all the follow-up damage as well no hook Landing no cues Landing just such a confident mid laner here and that's not something that flight was since those talks about in the interview how big are is going to be in playing against Cloud 9 well right now five star down about five hundred gold and that's despite the extra 150 from the first blood coming through so good as to The Landing phase of Cloud 9 so far you've got about a to Camp lead for bladder and 15 CS for licorice going to paying that off and I'll see if like us and get more done course not drink is used in gold value I would say not at 500 just yet you know I like a licorice is playing this 250 mention oh yeah the early Bramble vest with the extra SDSU was able to get alphabet counter kill on viper at Turner turn it into a nice lead for him you don't get to solo kill the 8 Sox unless they charge chooses to make a mistake right if he goes too aggressive on you overcome its on this debt know he's applying the Bramble vest unto himself he's getting faded and by the W but it does allow you to go for the call and you can legally cash it on extra priority extra money that way. Having to try and earn yourself a solo kill which would have to come at the cost of your opponent choosing to do something there is a note to self but that's fine but I want you to consider cold
