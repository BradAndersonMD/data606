hey that's in a Content team is going to be 6 ply steer that that's how I feel these going right now is one of these actually not that far for making that are going to happen I think they can make the climb near Reading when do you know it's not at the top six of a stacked up this Monumental lead it's very very close between your six and even laughed so under these certainly have an opportunity to continue climbing up in the stand strong together three straight win but last weekend up against give them and liquid very tough opponents they did lose both of those and the question is now cuz they're playing atoms atoms only was the Three Twins it is not too. We are done fixing bands already and you can see support bands I have been coming out as well Karma's but want to know big surprise here either or give me the first regulation match on 913 for bothexcited to see if they ever have new stuff cooked up we saw darmon sport relief for example and got so it's pretty exciting we definitely have to go by Passenger bonding in various things like that kind of making their way into the LCS but we're not expecting more of a continuation of the time standard play that we have been studying but banging aphromoo have been playing a lot more aggressively and I think they've been playing better and that is somewhat of the Catalyst to there were due to that big deal I think there has been getting a lot better to split as well he was a very big pick up and he came in his first lieutenant he was an MVP got I think it was third place with his one back then go to solid run and now looking I always loved it dhokla hovers Wukong for Allure on every time he is still up to match the scaletalk to do kind of prefer the has your side of this feeling that you're going to be able to have the bush in the midline if you have to poke out for me to make it a kind of tough for the Corgi in the early stages of course I barely even matchup in a very still dependent but we will see if we was going to kind of handshake on that stealing match-up is a Corky player and kind of always has been so I wouldn't be shocked to see that but there are always some of the other answers you know trying to go a little bit more aggressive trying to go for a roaming thousand and trying to put the game at a pace that is your has told me you're so charmingly picked up and he's definitely can be a high-tempo jungler we saw actually how well do your the game went just the previous one man Cloud 9 starving got several GameStop in the early games to work quite able to convert time to be going to grab more hard engage more Frontline is Nautilus grabbed up nowbaby getting paired with the diet I have seen that combo quite a lot and we haven't gone and out my mistake though see where they're going to go I can be a good aggressive option as well if you want to go that part of a route on the respect and of Draven is already been thrown the way they are also know maybe then I'll do that lane power from Las Vegas and try to go for it yourself of that pic as well as it takes away takes most played five Nautilus games for two of you may step listen to have AZ refocus Pani Puri always be different and has the for troll that can certainly matter as well it looks like he's actually care that much about Silas to delete this game playing decent bit of Darkness will put him as the most played in your title loans 561 e a r x I hear for meteos a bit more of an aggressive look at that cut his first play this split he has been to a morondo t&n for me I think you're very very well with that in a video certainly has been one of the standout players for optic I doubt it him and brown have been in a really caring a lot of of kind of load your for the squad and and the Restless players are certainly Plainwell around them but they have been I think what a lot of their games have been coming down here they're in the match of no City counter pick their front of these is just ridiculous stealing Champion themselves also jungle has grabbed us Darvin first did Rex I'm at now and then it gets a bit more different did Yvonne medals won the one side a truck stop on the other hand out means you got decent rolls they're expecting some more support bands of hunters music please. Was intended or not you know sometimes the teens snow are just good load actually lock him in the neck that can count against them but if it was some sort of a client error than we will obviously be pitching stafflooking at probably not even if it was just being slow or what but we'll stop down and show you a chance again when it comes back up yeah yeah usually I don't believe will actually reset if it would just slow I think the actual just lose that band so I had to be some sort of a you know it's one of the teams will say that it's like lying for lock-in or things like that but either way it's to me we are restarting picks and bans will be the same up to that point and I do think that you know 400 East Side I was kind of expecting more Marksman. Albans and retargeting arrow you can look at that or the support perhaps another do you think they're trying to get some sort of an edge on the bottom side and if you want to find out if you want to play aggressive know there's kind of the two sides of the coin do do try to deny the support that stop your engage or do you try to take away some of the ladies like Ezra who might be able to play more seriously around ithuman keyboard error interface so we'll be just when we get back at us when the 10 players in the lobby so as long as we have all the spectators and referees if that's what we need will be okay we'll see you in that comes through but shouldn't be too long from now and yeah I am curious what can 3D Mansion marching band seems to be likely is he looking for I'll waste makeup Nautilus work pretty well you know getting ready for the safe ones especially I think you know letting yourself option two planets as real probably feel a little bit weak in that case as you know just get away from thing you ever do and nothing ever looks good there but we have to wait to see what the choices end up being and what the counter pick Top Lane is going to be there as well because once you see the mid laner you see that the jungler you know they charge for dhokla is for dopes line of descent and end whenever you want you can grab fake-outs counterpick Dad definitely a variety of Champions will see if he has anything new in store for that match up in particular I don't think Kenny was banned but I'm I'm having trouble with her or she ain't going that Glee that can be a fairly good match if you want to play the into the atrox play towards the early gameI'm look for that certain Advance their have gotten an update a little bit ago it was about 3 minutes that we were looking at for this delay before we will get back in about a minute ago so I get around to pay rent a minute I also heard that all the picks in Van up to that point remain valid so the first three bands first to fix preside all going to say the same as well meet us on your screen play I want to talk about cuz I have really enjoyed watching the split so far you keep mine in Spring he was spending time with with Darla connecting everything on the dice thing I was really sure who would have been the better pic I didn't think because all that convincing I think either one would be the case for him but I have been all about media so far this but I think he's been absolutely phenomenal for optic all split long there in playoff position and they're looking good in a lot of because of him I think he's even very very consistent and he's a player that has been extremely consistent throughout his entire career right you know you look at his all-time record in the ALCS it's a ridiculous when right he has been no certainly one of the best performing players for so many years in the league and I think sometimes because he's not always playing theflashy style he can be overlooked at times but certainly is a very effective player and what do you bring to the team I think through comms If you experience is extremely valuable as well just get worried that we are just kind of checking the clients use of this document that you additional issues going forward they did have a band that one flock in weren't able to do it so I'm making sure that there will not be any repeats of that issue I have a question for you now as we talked about media some more please wait for the game to start what was your favorite media Ozark because there is additional Cloud 9 blown out blonde hair medium roast there is the return with Phoenix one of the Dark Knight gameplay if what any anime were like a nice guy videos nice guy medium term for it like what what is this media is look now because I was beginning 12.7 KDA whatever it actually wasI'm in the dark video songs and now we're just like journeyman extremely good jungler forever nice guy media guess though I let us know on Twitter I'm not going to lie my D&D NPC Jeff and stuff like that I get up and go home but that's how it goes but once again they're out of this conversation all right we got the bands and pick them up through pretty quickly here as we do have a lobbies back up and actually looks different than normal as the bands are coming through a locked in that's a new look for me but we'll get that up on your screen as soon as we are ready to go on to that side and the coaches and players get ready to resume where they left off in the pics Advanced not sure why it looks that way that is strange but hopefully we will have no issues just waiting on those bands come through for both side and I'm sure we will be popping a chance like once we arrive back to where we were in the big bands though it is not full parody you know we have both been leaders locked in all we have a top laner as well as a jungler there for optic and no we are assuming jungle as well as support for hundred thieves so generally speaking we are looking for what kind of band started towards the pieces that you're going to have not yet tracked it right that is certainly what you were trying to do in a hundred thieves you have a lot of engage already with his Nautilus you for so I'll be excited to see if they are going to try to really emphasize that strength and look for it for very aggressive sort of draft where they can try to play a much more up-tempo game going to be 7 to see what they do if you want to go for here as we finally have the electric coming thru HRS just got locked in the wrecks I was going to follow pretty soon after and then we will get us all back up on your screen I feel stupid stuff into my monitor and and they're just showing off their faces I just I'd like it when the visual medium you know life is what I'm saying and it's just unlucky here but we are finally into the real face of the band I was truthful and talk about the tempo on this one is the band of they're having Hollister going to add some support bands that makes a lot of sense to take that time off the table someone who can certainly denial of that hard games already have quite a bit of it has like more, I do think that's another band that could make some sense if you want to talk us into for pool we're going to snatch it up quite well into now it's so easy to black shield and out of the cell from a very very telegraphed ability has a long travel time so they could consider for this final band Big Lots camping pool and a strong match up there are other good matchup but they're less common in competitive play you know we do see the other range mashup things like playing with you never really see you but even Jack's we have seen showcase that can be quite good are we happy few will bring up from the jail in Nebraska meals been like more top laners there are feeling like we want to play for the lane in that room is too powerful in that so Minnesota State Fair in the bottom Lance's tells me they're looking for a grow through the bot Lane almost looks like maybe you don't spend your time down the bottom line here is it you think that has the ability to to go towards something like a Morgana knows there are still others say planners one line to Caitlin even though we haven't needed that much that can be a powerful do and I think now it's though that would be something you could look toward a Veris Auto can be a pretty strong often but you can have that added layer of not having a dad was to make a difficult actually feel this Nautilus and I want to be first dibs Marston pick and they are going to look for not that just yet but then but that seems unlikely but a game plan for the match up against a trucks no problem but what to do with the entire office afterward and they really into instead of actually blind picking that spot later they really do want to get a strong match up into their opponents they're going to look actually pick 4 Lane in a saving that martians Pick 4 Lane for her for bank and there's a possibility that he brings out a champion or navy Champion or something like that but this does mean you give over Lucien right you know. It's kind of what my expect if it wasn't at your will be able to grab that away so he is kind of taking it generally strongly Champion that has a dock which can help do a voice and all us until until 4 so the question is then just like what is the pic that hundred thieves connect to grab your ass and be fairly strong does have a lot of Leaning Tower but Lucien thrashes is there really going to be too and I think that you are one big have got themselves pretty kind of bulletproof laying here where it feels like it's really hard to get it boots with two guns I'm going to make it a bit harder here and 60 seconds ago and it's been 6 or at least players play mid and bring them down here all kinds of weird stuff and partially self don't really think like a horse play the threat himself but it is certainly not bad but it's a lot worse than I expected honestly you know this is such a late game style of of composition of feels like 400 I thought the last pick was going to be more lean Focus trunk what kind of powerful and they can look through
