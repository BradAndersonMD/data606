even look at some of the stats that don't necessarily shop in wins but as far as getting stuff done early kills busted in 15 minutes behind the engine has been playing very well enabling broken plate to leave the league as in toppling killed with 37 and thinks you're going great but are definitely trending upwards to the end of 27 and 5 maybe not be highest record of being TSM house before but certainly a strong team attention Golden Garden Andover they can turn from what recent slide around but again I Dimensions to into with this generation of the roster and I think treading water with generally both pretty well for the squad to fix games to play and then get a couple more bands coming through as 3 support bands of human I guess I'd really say to soda for 6 weeks a spot Lane farming champion andI want to take a moment to talk about Jonah in the LCS in particular because I know a lot of LPS fans are very pacini's in seeing this champion in games however the ALCS in particular prioritizes stonith 60% and elec 32% in the lck and 22% in the LCL and dispatch him particular since I actually works Dona has dropped from a present to 54% to 18 yet it does seem like any teams are still very willing to ban Sona I'm not staying that is wrong I think that is a regional difference because they put more time into picking anyone else so they were going to be more hesitant to drop it even after receiving herplay in what is an NA Academy that be one of the first place that brought it out I think PSN Academy that sells what are the first four runners there and take them bands in the back to take Sports down here stylus for contract must do what the Damage Done To The Jungle roll and hit by a kid instead you wanting and an early as real here for his vent yeah it's been pretty much the only thing you seem like you ever played back in 2018 put a lot in Spring as well this will be his third as real game of this foot and because they have this is 1 a even though the incredibly strong Suwanee irelia Joe is gone it is still a strong pick I'm going to go ahead and grab a winner here for before it's all over and I got to fly into space rocks are the top spies do their Blain's Farm probably 80 karrie heerfordt FBI as well as their mid laner for frog in is going to be with picked up laps right here earlier if you don't mind those wordsplay down to the bottom right away the most difficult. I'm looking forward to see what contracts can do on this island Divani at level Tik Tok Tok reasonable at your ruling in the ER the game not the best ultimates Bastille so far on the table at some point as well sit still very very high priority in abortion work on not going to play since you ready to the prom there's not a huge reason to care about Society either you don't typically solar a collie actually does make sense for me to consider Broken Blade in Jacksonville with very good at taking the game in their own hands and rid of a lot of flexibility this realization that and let me see if Kiana which team in baseballagain for Capriccio which are deer in particular the most picked mid laner this split in the LCS if it is so heavily fit down a little bit surprised it's not bad more for 9 want to try and acted when she rains but knowing Bjergsen and frog and style thinking he would be a pretty good choice as there would be a good choice but it's not really blind fix here for the Frog inside play spaghetti crop top for FBI's we know what the bronchitis and I'll go to go to the play at hear themselves up against Tom Kent as real pretty free lights for guys to get a lot of gold I don't really see if you can pull it out by that but I thought that you kill off his face and something from you two goals that should be pretty safe here Keanu is the Battle of Champions Copley similar reasonsand now what you play up there you know you're right yeah I think you actually send me as your top into aatrox or that I can get the Camille Camille midst and work is when we did see a little bit but yeah it's probably as you're making it all right to see the day where frog and Flexes in the support and who he takes mid because who he has been an amazing run has several support wins NLCS already here. With a few times did it happen is Play 3 CT up top as well by the way so you never know for sure but probably been here for frogging yeah and I very much expect her to be playing by a truck going up against the me-too effect that lane because we met you before even know how much has been so strong in the waning phase a what's 17 CST is 15 by he has the lowest I'm just going to leave because off in time contract trying to make stuff happen Elsewhere on the map and it draws a plane and let's have to go to work and against the Camille excuse to want to get involved in the attack of the Suwannee Stone in 1.5 seconds and kill you that's when it becomes far is still good, louder on yet another Silas dance at a very good one previously puts out a lot of damage do you are and light on tanked it's wrong to support roles you're only obvious Freightliner that can make things a little bit difficult sometimes break him down a lot of backlash metaphor still available in 1 C of hard engaged for TSM camills hardly think that's the one he can as well it depends Puritan on his beer this could be very spicy position go to go to the game behind also in 5th 6th and guardian has here so we got to see that again but we also get to see what could be a season 2 finding moment for Golden Guardian what is the difference in our perception of you seemed really think of Guardians it's like Guardians would have clawed out a win that game they would actually have a better record than CSM and then looking forward golden Guardians remaining schedule is the hardest in the LCS so you could consider this a must-win and it's a team they have beaten in the spring and been very close to beating so far in the summer Hot Spot look for a ward in the tribe rush but you cannot put one down I'm assuming up some level of research and expecting where tsm's Ward's likely are that's around on happening if the youth employment for standing out in the corners at looking for long-range vision and they won't get caught by end of this year quiz fake gold cards into Brown Flats to you you can often kill someone out right away. They are not spotted not killed and it's going to be just a yeah I think if they weren't against a Tom Camp Suwannee golden Guardians would have actually invaded harder Brom usually just Windsor Lee invade Israel would be the best which they don't have here they have the bronchi so but it does Busch contract to a fox I'd start yet it is fairly known for Golden Guardians of the Cajun stop starting to cycle especially with that all the time. A lot of times in Pro the jewel names just going to start in the rain for security and takes up half actually Dodge's store on board the put-downs nevermind he does his own Ward after Camp so that's that's big bring it there by Katy and that's that's the bottom panel of the Galaxy brain, Kyle he's going for some really cheeky I think he's expecting contracts to go I guess after can eat but it's actually not a great level to Champ because you need the W2 come through he's literally just has CUNY but with the melee he'd be able to get Stones I'm a little surprised he's making that move maybe he expected contracts to do a different path yeah ends up to coming back to take his bill he was about 15 to 20 seconds. To be lost the first Krug that's the timer there and they kind of go to match back in and go to the Jungle camps once again but yeah that minion right as the game is coming around he did Dodge all the boards sadly Hunters playing so far back that he was not getting Columbus Origins and there's going to be picked up there but yeah that could have been the possible crazy first letter U show read from the top side but I'm going to have an earlier clear for sure here at 4 cicadas open the pickle buckets out of the map with kind of unlucky there get the Talisman and he's taking blue and Grump and read all of which kind of rather have hunted machete for absolutely you would I thinking about how this bottom line is going to play out I'm curious to see how much attention Acadian will eventually pay to it but they're also up against like I said who you don't normally want to give easy laying face too especially and he was in for the kill but doesn't go for it there instead of what smoothie walk back into into the back lines that reason to have a potion so it definitely looks like we can do in the summer but if you are very rude I know you'll only find the first 4 minutes playing two completely different sides of the map Hunter we able to get a lot of help out does burning flesh but the successful dive and kill for contracts is Silas also taking into account how Acadian didn't have an efficient XP clear contract hits 644 Suwanee see how clean this guy was right here watch how they kind of balance the turntable because whenever you see the guy who gets first blood not have to immediately flash out it means they've done something right so who he grabs turn a growth landvik you say we did we get this done knows how many hits you can take and then since the kills already happened no one retake Ezra so it's literally just three hits on who he that's about as Queen of a thank you stamp it on the team at that point in time is no problem just to be safe Hebron summer heels just in case you needed it didn't fit it was just too if you helped make sure nothing went wrong and it was pretty beautiful right there so golden Guardians off to a great lead and everything I've seen from this Duo has been can they play aggressive in Kennett workout to get punished they've been thinking I have one One Direction that go in his Ford sometimes they're coming a horrible sometimes they do and they pop off and it seems to be louder hey go for play sand in the past that had been an issue for teens that have organized they say frog and does nothing but sitting playing I actually would say as well part of golden Guardians Resurgence is frogging is playing much more aggressive he's had a fairly dominant Lane phase about the second-best laning phase mid laner in the right so many times you should see frogging with a low forks and this year it's up at 27.7% which without contact me nothing but it's around like third highest in the league right thing. I'm pushing for a little bit more frog in front of some cards out so we had just going to keep on attacking them anyways back and forth equal CS properties players contracts I believe Dodgers Vision with the path you just took right there no pain from bruises very least and has anyways if we get back and forth any of those little bit low to grab this grab honey production needs it you just put the heart down in the jungle monsters thanks for the control board there is division there's the resources and violence to looking pretty soft the golden Guardians side aggros the dragon realized there was a ward in there but they can do it supposed to feel pretty safe and froggy had just recalled Midland party and just a formality and specifically with your chin was looking forward to the climate which will give frog in a lane pressure bandage they both recalled fog and teleported back gave him completely infertile Drake very powerful break in two minutes of it coming up and going to be the early but instead of resources there's a Golden Gardens happy they're already winning the bottom land they Hyrule Drake's this point every single stamping on their team aside from the Broncos really going to care about the bonus attack damage in the bonus a piece that's going to be nice you you kind of lucked into a lot of citizens here if only they could have picked Leona then they have the Guardians my vernacular is now very tea if he had me but I really meant in League of Legends sense I'll give you that one but he actually true that was on Reddit everything free okay
