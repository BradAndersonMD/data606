our team we're right for three players at their first time at a pro-level Nubian 64th and have a lot of title to the names as well but the top three like these are all the new guys and go right with this diving top wait till I get kills in a size like GTA Maryville right like a really really good you can have it right beside of them needs to grow up he's right you can tell when people are talking about the Maryville Squad they were like oh that's really cool how Niles was able to join golden guardian and take a jungle duo with you that's what Lane is would love to do you know our eye blinking by jungle with you guys going to kick continue to can't male for me for me it is but I caught a quiz been in the spotlight for Golden Guardian so you know like you're saying talk him up because he is receiving their sprinkling through a nice interation in my opinion because iconic in the game yesterday so that he can he's very well equipped to use a champion today and then they go after some of the top Lane takes that were talking about piping up if Carrie Carrie potential here irelia from Revenge off of his performance yesterday meanwhile they don't want to let him take the Camille cuz I guess Brent doesn't want to play Jack or Ouroboros doesn't want to spend too much time there is convenia what's the champion. I like in him to the most of the applicant releases down the Comfort level some what it does mean the Olaf is up at the beer pick they got rid of the 7th at 6 a might have picked and that means that yeah you know there is I would say you Note 3 to 4 as you don't lose a lot of definitely one of them and then Premier and iconic who's the best performing play on Golden Gardens of getting an incredibly smart Pick 4 FL a hard time believing that we're in a world where is your Jungle Band ahead and go there like go ahead first take the whole lot of the times I have available and they're not a lot of great answers to Renekton if you wanted to do hey we're going to do carry style topside that would be a great pic early for Revenge doesn't look like going to invest in it quite yet I do still like it though keeping him back your mind because AP junglers have gone through the band face literally still available to Leah still available if you pick a red-necked in for that and you remember to charge up your Fury for your longer stud then kill combo and if so has not a single one of them his career so far even despite having some very successful run through Academy going to be the spot he's in pretty early on would not mind an early work on here and let dick say and do to get a lot done I think that if we're going to put a stack rank with it up from is a Golden Gardens are iconic and the bottom line I would love to give the Moore agency is trying to find winds early on keep in mind that in this year for LCS for 20 21 exist playoffs world right which means these games out right now for 8 days if there are going to be easier wins on on the board it games like this I want to see them influence at 8 go towards winter the game Pet Grooming in to desire interesting here for Mortals they are going to have a great fall delivery system you shock wave Attack Grill is always a great combination and you've got pipes me to follow up on it I would say they're probably looking at it you know. And attack tattoo yet instead of instead of bottom land then set up the desire and cut off the global at the source which I've always been a big fan of the strategy going to start a global sell-off while TF is really strong right now and you can enable your side lance that he might be taking a bit of extra Focus here has got a lot about on the bottom side stop playing Focus continues my friend yeah I expect Mortals to go for counterfeit there it works really well for event last night but if any of you heard how far is interview earlier today talk about you know the reason they lost three Mortals was there a little too cocky the Canon in D really went into him it went badly and throw horse Renekton is being is being left up here still and and that feels like unless you're willing to do Quinn which actually is so maybe they're they're leaving it up as I get really nervous even if I'm the team at picking you do a hard capture like like Quinn that if you die if you lose jungle pressure there so many things that can go wrong with it but not now we're getting right down to it both of them left up Immortals not going to show their head first and we get to see is Niles going to go for it because of bands at Top Lane Niles Niles is got the blind pick so they got rid of his Camille is comfort and the two big range tops that you can blind in NJ sand narf will Niles go to paint Duty or released y'all come to my land where do we get there but whatever the great, I'll get my eyes really are on what you got I was going to take cover pick instead because he's he's self-proclaimed best GP and this is something he goes to Blind Pig all the time you need to pick it right up and we do get the ivern you could if you really wanted to flex those two right now and it's still switch over to Jungle a neck rub the top side but I'm expecting it to be that the topside I ran into GP he he can Farm out towards the Moonstone be a great team Fighter for the squad's this Immortal team fight is looking beefy Golden Gardens better get on that Twisted Fate Ablaze Olive your first ultimate your second ultimate you got to be proactive with this you got an Olaf jungle and a Twisted Fate mid those two how to get stuff started before this group that Immortals have constructed here with Crazy amounts of filled with double solo Lane shielding Champions is is able to bring them and apply them to the acronym alright worldwide this is the fifth ivern top pic of the year it is currently three and one of those wins over in the LDC well one of the wins and losses Wonder Woman on it crazy lost but it is going to be fun to do this one come out this is this is what we like you know what just kidding we're not we're not doing the skill check top lame we are playing support of God we're all right and we're out what's going on at the utility that you do get for it is going to be all about this this team fight for Mortals they're building their cop send it around this so we're going to have our eyes on the early objective priority towards the bottom side of map with those dragons you don't have to send any juggle attention up to the top side to further I burn actually one thing that is often overlooked for the I've learned is the amount of extra damage you get from your pasta for being and brush and so even though you permanently has ranged attacks now you don't have to get into breast for rain to text you it's still really really heavily utilize for top Wayne to get that extra damage because you're Early Trades are actually significant with it and it and it does allow you a decent amount of control up there so basically just you know if you don't have to apply much attention and then try and group up for later all right just being a course this little late and you can't attack gold Global GP to make it look better cause of very explosive land of course or you can go top and Byron going to be alone without much support and not all of them. Things out for me to watch for the Immortals very much a team fight Wombo composition is there insanity and Rays going to be there for all of the damage with some support for the Iran and okay is there going to be anything spicy here hoping to maybe do it. Ideally they looking at Force the tribez person over toward the recondo so they work on can men W knock up over the wall and Mortals suss it out nice defensive movement from Revenge watch back way early into the correct brush Instead This has become very common that I've actually started here multiple secret names for that exact opening play I do I repeat all of them actually I don't I don't think we need to go down that path but the idea is always you try and find all the the enemy top laner from the tribe us to run towards your CC Champion doesn't have to be work on anything with a long-range cc to fire over the wall it is become so commonplace though that it's expected now and it's nice to see the defensive opening their from Mortals seeding grass I'm back and ride off nobody with any of the fish in here to start out Smart Buy Revenge we did see they learned and his okay what's the normal time in here what's it going to do sit in that brush but good burn and he's going to get the grass off as well extra q and that is a trade advantage health potion for Revenge he's going to feel comfortable with more things to craft a potion and Rebecca be careful he's not quite a lot so fairly reasonable but yes there is going to be you no more XP more gold or early pronounce we first little to do with the extra passes damage so you see Revenge using the brush twice kills it early so I can get the extra damage he drops back in every few Autos to be able to replenish its butt dials trial by fire for Gangplank if utilized that you can go so aggressive early on grass Q's as well coming through no problem delayed control gain but they should know it was a bottom Stipe start freezer say they feel a little bit worried nice stunt as well but you know how do you Auto e almost gets you there couldn't quite get salt in the lambo still a solid trades or say yes going through a pretty full cleared to take prompt as well so go to the entire Jungle by the rev up towards the Crux to buy sometime you might want to take time to get you want to make sure that confused a stacked for the cooldown pretty solid underneath the truck and push in 3 ways than recall play allows him early doran's blade and just take that relief first recall to walk back to Lane the kind of camps over close next to the other one by the way should be standard practice on any jungler that doesn't have some sort of clear mechanic that requires you to stand still I can't emphasize this enough when when you see jungle clearers often times that the people falling behind in the races these autofill junglers are once I just stand at the current Camp Auto attacking and using their spells on the thing to death it does save you a significant amount of time to always least your Camp over towards the next one the crop up towards wolves wolves over towards mid so you can get the Raptors quicker literally all of them cuz travel time is such a big deal when you're when you're clearing your jungle move speed is so important for junglers and and that should be something that especially people who are auto-filled into the role can actually gain a lot from give it to your laser didn't do it actually kill and make it through teleport even though I don't play with people on TV very often so I don't know for certain not quite sure either I don't think so yeah I know the TP I imagine there's no way that works in in length appreciate you can't you can't mail the menu with it yeah right back down there for the for the Olaf and he rushed the tier-2 Lucidity boot for the extra cooldown reduction by the way we have felt very very very rarely see the rain support items on wreck on you so often see what she'll be says you don't look this matchup not afraid of any and gave it all I can always get a way I can fix a we want to play aggressively I want to order your turret you learn used and so far it is working to see if they can XIV they're smashing bottling truly are and you know I didn't really hear you the first time we talked about so ridiculous 6 that way it should be able to get in here goes down all right that is why it's so risky to just kind of blind go for one of those dragons especially ocean Drake slows you down to do much damage not six
not sure about the validity what are tournament is so early in the year and we're already getting this type of adaptation I mean if we would have stopped it at anything or earlier it look like hundred thieves steam roller to dominating Cloud 9 but game after game here in the last do Cloud9 have fought back if persevered and now it's time to lay it on the line that will go back to more Moonstone Champions William scaling to heal 4505 later or will they try to do some more poke duels the the play regardless of whether it was supportive Champs hard carry Champs has been great so they know they can rely on the bottom Lane already Small Change here to Leah given up in exchange for the Renekton band denying that one from someday they don't want nobody to have to go into that againimmediately the exact same draft for these two teams I'm curious how long it's going to go because like yeah we want Jack to me last time no problem will change the lock with all the way down instead of instalocking the sets and moving it in the mid lines are going to grab Trail right off the bat of this is the chant they want for who he and he has received zero Vans aside from Pantheon and none of his way you like how I beat Cloud Nine all right I want to see it the Affiliates is still available as well picking up a 10 for palaver he doesn't have any support right now usually we see it with you on some sort of speed boost in his own right b t and since he does have crowd control on his team that can also be viewed as support you know set up for the possible plays but I personally attest picking router and a Jack's play the shamisen season 1 it's snowingbecause every part of your kid is auto Attack Base and guess what Counter-Strike the gates at all it's going through Dodge DF get through so that's definitely one Champion that hundred these can rely on and will cause a thorn in the side of Cloud 9 and you're seeing the bands come through with Sven on Santa is really scary that man put that he looks much the whole bunch of respect this is outstanding after practice player has a lot nicer Persona is outstanding get alongside real cuz you couldn't deliver the routes done so to get rid of Twisted Fate so like you can choose your all into it if you are keepingJack of the Twisted Fate and you can go with the rail like your talk that is great Synergy because you can easily physician the magnetic stud but it also has the defense of property is if you're keeping track of the Rocket Jump as well as your ultimate both very good night Miss Fortune again then presented as can we play it really really well I was huge fan of how strong that Lincoln be if I would be a fan of Sigma food come out for we know his set up we'll see what comes through though as how did he have a galio option if they want to pick so instead I think what 425 games has some kind of teleportation bought his ultimate I guess haha was the one where it looks pretty good and feignobviously yes it does not also have the teleport you have abilities so you at Jack's and Rise 131 with the Lea as your Crocs in the middle being able to wall people opting a little kick people off of being able to try and answer the Twisted Fate probated will do free let's get it with the r l you can also have a lot of combination plays you can position the attract repel done very easily as well but it's also good for knocking back and tumbling away from you dear the thing you have to worry about is very clearly going to be the Camille galio combination the Twisted bottom laid all those are going bottomland parties of everybody coming down is going to be very difficult here for FBIwell then it's going to be a fun one to watch for this is going to be exciting over all 16 games so far of vein in top readings is 50/50 there as well the galio comes in around out the composite fair enough really well so far this seriously couple games he's played the champion it's all coming out of it's all coming out again five hundred thieves have certainly been still playing the same so aggressive style yeah I mean this is going to be the decisive game of for the series it's also going to be the decisive game for vein pray and pro play currently cuz it's going to tip the scales either above or below the 50% let's get it it's going to be two very different play styles for these two teams as well obviously we talked about the 131 set up here they're going to try and split the map for the Jacks for the risemake those plays without getting caught by all of the global Twisted Fate berxer he had a great game last game on Twisted Fate for cloud nine they're going to need another one from here alright FBI using the game plan of don't buy your ticket as live bait in the comes automatically it's really optimal gameplay the close the page anyway so you cannot be true you start a different cool that I didn't buy it because it would go down when you bought the item has been gone for a while though so whatever you can say to click applying for cardless just something you know like play around like I would always let me check it out first before I bought poking through a door into they want on my way just in case in your muscle memory now I second word yet and now it's actually there's no game plan all alright well it's the switching of trinkets gameplay once again dropping your defensive word then switching over to your sweeper by the way again highly recommend this for you dear especially because you can just do your full power clear before your Scuttle Scuttle crab even Spas so it's really nice to have your sweeper ready to go earlier can just make plays right after the first clear use your flash very aggressively to light flashes blue flashes on on your enemies or even be able to chase them down so she does have the phase rest and you just have to get to them and land those Autos first delayed invade is not seen yet active late they don't know yet but I doubt they don't want to knock down the top side Ward and gave fudge and perks the XP so they can get level 2 off of the first wave so really, it's up there but because of that hundred things are going well that's your player on the bottom side and puss take a whole bunch of cats down right now right this is a pretty solid been pretty bad for the FBI support as well and now you can close our side jungle and protein and more has been takes a big hits as well. Who he's very slow that's going to hurt a fair bit play sit perfectly Vulcans in danger he will stay alive a lot was going on there really care about but either way it is one of these plan better the Box you want to board the word is going to see him still ask the flash by goodness of anus set up freaking this is it the dream scenario now there are no Summoner spells for either a t carry on the bottom half of the map and blabber because of the opening doesn't have a lot of territory to work with eyes are going over with his small camps being taken away just going to have to finish up on his own world he's going to be behind expect more focus on the bottom side of the map what a great engage right there VIA Rail stunt still a logo off after spin classes cuz he was able to Crockett so they close enough to walk them and they followed up there by FBI no hesitation and they get the first Blood where's a good job I had a fuse to grab this one that we have no we don't have time there's a fight in the top side down fudge has to jump a way he will go away from this game cool about closer what's he showed going to left jungle a what in the Midlands that I don't think I blew it's too late what's this is incredible this game is just too hectic I want to write honestly we are looking for punishes on bottom side I did not expect it to be at the tier 2 turrets what flavor goes hard flat surface from him and Vulcan since there's no Subs on FBI and hey you got the first blood but look at your CS buddy that is able to get another Minion wave in he's going to finish this one off plus the Cannon as well and get off the recall yep Waverly clearance event of a man that doesn't matter though he's got to get a really nice to recall this one pretty much almost over money or at least the components of should feel fairly comfortable in for FBI stunt double longsword so yeah pick up there talk it's pushed you can see with not a lot of interaction Sunday is very far ahead topside yet again yeah ants and it again it is blabber starting on his top quadrant of the map to so we already talked about all the trades in last game where you hook me up with you two can't get your auto off to a Counterstrike you're not going to park your own adaptive shield and you're at your trade is fruit but no blabber starting red clearing towards the bottom as well and then showing twice both mid and bottom means that he was also operating under the assumption that he has some days going to try and take advantage as much as he can because they've got a lot of info on his junglers position to start me to Monta going pretty well or even if I'm out of that one they usually stacked this one obviously Hitman itself with the dentist at 4 right so you can kind of make up for the lack of a pea under the door and rang and it's not a problem by letting you see is very clear Tennessee athlete or so is a whale gets in Dallas and claimed by Zeno taught watch a shoot so yeah I feel pretty comfortable on the Cloud 9 Scion defeat those still playing towards their arguably biggest win condition that is still the side lane Jack do you still very scary and fudge he is down two levels right now this is horrible to do with gets level 5 without the ultimate you're still not that safe against to die but because of bladder is there they have to call off the dogs I can't go for much more so at least get to catch up in a farm back yeah I can't do anything without Flash to Tulia but it also creates a stalemate because actually I can't go for the dive so if I was just showing themselves to stare down there just after walk away but provides fudge the ability to clean up the much-needed Minton way that is dollar because that is going to get painful quickly Twisted Fate level six. I'll do 4 perks let's see if they can actually set it up again towards the bottom side still no flash for FBI but he does have the cleanse available unless he used it in the last little engagement so I think you should at least still have that still the setup is going to be very scary especially since blabber is transitioning over to bottom half but so is closer cuz it's here who he does have a flat fee needs a w comes in can not quite get the flip back to go down at work as soon as he had sex you have to have that on your mind who he and closer will do their best to clean this up but the damage is done to mate goes down in the aftermath as well off to the dragon to start stacking I'll correct us to 2414 Vulcan did losing his life for that play but very much so that you type in all chat because those are a couple of Great Kills and again okay Twisted Fate ultimate will get popped in mediately they're already transitioning down towards the bottom half will live more action photos of phlash away from Sunday Vulcan will not have the damage he's not going to go either as soon as he is almost within the realm of possibility for a galio even if he is support but some days till healing back up he's got a bat scepter no more plays down there fudge those still lose because they have to walk back Elaine yeah that's a bad sign if some day is already able to fight his way out of a hex Tac Toe tomade him set up gang at the galio came over and fudge has to run himself a wave barely escaping with now a flash discrepancy we co there's a pain on the Vulcan so it must have been spotted in his tricky play you can see on the mini-map he's just hovering up there in a fresh but a blue thing went down here for a hundred thieves you know what yeah I think he would have been seen going through those brushes anyway and now he's like okay I'm show is fine no place whatever clear the way about Cloud 9 a lot of control tops I was actually went over there they're going to start on the rift Herald here as well lot of protein. One they'd already claimed the dragon from the earlier play so C9 that'll be up in Gold they're up in farming in a lot of these lions are going to get a lot of global tracking to be stacking Harold to me to tell Rick kill before too long it would just be able Top Lane but I can't wait for a second there something going around got some in a dangerous spot they know that this is definitely his weak-side doesn't have any business snooping around trying to get experience or gold out of the side of the map because they already as soon as they say they saw walking sticking around on that word since closer in
game one or game too and I think that's like what has really looked on so EG no yes you can do different things and Raph they didn't go to read size like Mark and probably were hoping for to get a good match of our kind of people we want to call it Forge New K so it is going to come down to Kennebec skating game can you be on the same page and replicate some of the best you have in the later end of the split wood got you to that that's actually finish which put you in such a good thought you to be here right and got you the win over flyquest in your previous seriesI will the bands are caught up in some of these teams back way back earlier in plastic was a very big winning part of the opposition but they're out the train at the okay of Hailey's what we want let's grab that now almost feel like you have to take to run alongside it or potentially give it over to spend staring which can do flies a lot of the power of that foreign I don't know if they feel like Spence Karen is even willing to play that one though so they are going to go Calista likely they could just go to class at Eric and play what IDI played in the previous couple games they call Sue eclipse of ROM this is different options their butt and do to solo 10 torrented to Kumo in game one which is grab that sound effectShakira and like grab an early midliner in right now for the hat is so well, with with the callista I make top sport decision bit later now could you sing some very clever as you know maybe also the Crockett stopped at the crucial has been so willing for Spence Quran in playoffs most played in playoffs by far and they looked for the last chance to grab it get it now I like this the more I think about it whatsoever and look pretty pretty everything when when it got those later stages and they weren't able to actually enforce anything or anyone they gave me happen is a playmaker krakus is someone who can engage for you can have her leave gang write honestly with that body trim flashed also at the cast of six can be pretty strongit's going to be tight coming through another aggressive watch it online stay too but goes you on ESPN grnh virtual break we will see you back here for the start of the game I've got them a little bit the fries to the pike into the song catch Tomcats feels like such a strong denial pic but if you feel like you can run that lane Pike is another great room or right I kind of listed pikas is that third Champions on top of the day you know all of those roaming play making supports that ignore is known for a long time, Bliss which are Vans so whether or not it's good for that feels he can get out of plane put you in early make things happen elsewhere that has been a lot of what Blacklist has found success doing there now double Bening topless take away the itch Rock they're trying to force the bluff go for something new for him status of his band out the other two big ones out there for him so I am expecting him just go board top as the answer divorcing yet again I don't really know why I go see the jungle as they are going to keep up their romantic dark and throw down a lot of good and well right Dr norn can really start outside and I do want to know if he what does go for a tough Fighting Champion like the morning goes down to them like I don't know if you are on tank Duty Ghosts no play something like that and I'm curious what does come down as easy as well or just about that that by B5 there as a mordekaiser does has I think a better matchup against tanks but discomfort remaining unbanned it does give very good setup for sincere in on the tracks here to there's a point-and-click Stunna it is now a lane for him to gank because I can't get this and Tom kench really not the best Gangstaz are corgis good middling till farming there but not trying to be paired with the orne and that Pike I think can be quite a nice combo because the orange ultimate layered on top of the Nocturne ultimate can get people low enough to the point where I can go for the xq in 1 Spy Kids 2 reset in those fights and get that for call Mikhail that is so much of a gold injected springboard you into assessment team place of them and nocturnes deal with in those later stages I will say a lot more like an EEG draft than it has throughout most of this series I like those time Kent I am glad Greg is back there for Spence Terence the one small issue I have though is the midline is 3 + 7 all time on his ear it is very low and right pick for him hopefully looks good for him we'll see what happens we are on Match Point welcome back to our ESPN viewers we're going to see if life was close it out but I do like this EG dropped a lot more that they have the tools that they need to take a windsor in game 3 will be interesting to find out if they're going to be able to execute on that because well I do think they have an affair with a comfort that she looking at the gragas and looking at the Barclay and their dad is going to be very nice for them it also can be difficult I think in some ways when when you're looking at just the amount of Frontline damage that like what does have they could have been just wipe front to back you know with whitthorne upgraded items on cork yeah and turtle are they have the ability to play halfway through the side lane to be shut down some of the threat of something like Renekton bushing in that filing because of the Nocturne available there so exactly how does play out but I do think like us there are going to have their chances to and with how well power of evil has been playing he's on another scaling farming champion in the mid lane and you can expect him to be a monster come lay came on the car key all right you would go just ignore scrapped at the very beginning a game for a minute then going to hit your suitcase so far no but sitting around I mean they are probably ignores going to spot us okay hello you are there all right no no harm no foul back we go solo and centaurion again to look for the sweet going to look for the word that's not really doing too much they don't find nothing to kill but they got a very safely start on that side of the map yet again to get that rest up I think it's okay though I'm sure he would have gone for a whole cacao the same set itself I think it was a nod to the fact that he ji 2 games in a row has for that top jungle invade we do with the gripes Renekton and how tight are in the midline up and respond to that incredibly quickly and shut that down so I think he's just saying hey I'm going to spend a little bit of time in this early game to be able to respond to the Moon she has been making a cup times in a row andaz Apna Desh inverse much the Frog really high armor that one now smells like the bottom side table trays. They can do for healthy gains and it's going to be the length of looking to do some of the EG side pushing early on 4th Blackfoot not a hard look like Duo match up junk was a training camps back and forth and so far it's identical to Raptors be a very early on but with DPA and all the consumables there shouldn't be worried about a plant got a lot of pain for sure and he is actually going to do so for those going to short trades Us in traffic around here is a little bit careful but is getting low watch forced out of Keowee he really wanted to pay him interested in touring flash Force away easy For the First Time all series going to go to the game and that's obvious dear this is here is a dominating there in that one big strike me as the end of this wave and the way they can be stacked with the wave is screwed year I did lost a lot of those those are not many ants are there for him to collect it's 21 cf-27 what does that is by I've ever seen of the Corky the duffel do you want to kill me anymore I got a boy something small out right here which is way back like to three years ago when they're all the big 83 changes Riot there for the base Health Region of almost in March for the game except was totally played mid-length so he still has recently High base health regen but if he was sane solution that would be a horrible by cuz Bay Street and solo with both play Anything by then but I'd still rather have the rain going to rebuild it and then you were having to level two floor heat bite into a level 3 is there who already was been helped him and that put him in a situation where he had to fly away then santora and felt like even more of an over fourth where you're coming the situation we feel like we already met. We got to get something back to the centaurian over Jason's not knowing where he's been scaring his and he is divorced so it's definitely a bit of a mess up that was then Amplified by another mistake or they're they're kind of stuck in this sun cost fallacy were like yep today it was easy who played it better so it's 300 gold lead in the very early game protecting push-ups he going quite nicely up against its foreign very good job first thing I see if there is a really hard as Pike fight into a Comcast because if you want to get aggressive at all know if you ever see forward pumpkin she starts hitting you and can devour you ask you and kill you off so that is very very scary for ignorant playing this Pike and means they're going to have to play much more of a defensive game than you would normally want to on this Calista the trade-off obviously is that you have powerful roaming with ignore any open Play Making come in a mid-game if you fight time is going to try to make that worthwhile all right well not a lot of damage don't pop the band and it's not enough to soothe Kate gets two pills early on this is what ET wanted Evil Genius is finally coming alive in this series the first truly big moment it feels like for them of this three-game series just Zuki how have you will really low fear felt like he stick around but he's down a level he's out of Mana did you take goes and takes it down flashes over the wall and has the support of diesel and Spence are to continue this fight and then I think he's just going to kill you you are so squishy on that Pike at this point of the game look at the farm and the killing a monstrous lead for to do K in this early stage of the game beautiful beautiful exactly Valley is on the board for two kills a double to see us as well this is the kind of game that u g can a win will see them get off the finish line but it's obviously a great start it is a really really good start your me GA that can make you feel as a player in this series that hey we can actually do this look at these guys are so good in a little bit of that Swagger that I think he had created for themselves throughout the split and if it's been horrendous Fit Don't rejuv bead on the first death and it's a call on the second that he is so far away from his first completed item was very little power have you boys can be set behind in this game so I would like to see EG start stacking up a new bill start using this mid lane events that you have let's see those early dragons you have pressure in the bottle e2e to you have a massively Manning winning midlane take dragons take referrals start building towards a late-game wind condition now while you're ahead I would like to see if I can get some of the push down to the bottom side of the map I think they've generally had pushed pressure it's also the great for 3 call things had good Farms got the VF store right now in a state look very good for EG top links okay it's bouncing back and forth but can we could still feel very good the mat if it's well right he's got the team at powers like that should feel very very careful for the Renekton yes I would like to see these things come through I don't want to just stop down Play Farm off for 8 minutes and then wait for flight bus to catch back up so CDG could turn up the pressure keep things going on yes I agree completely there should be no reason that you give up first dragon when you are math we had in Midland we had a cracker and Bob Blaine and Jungle Book I want to be concerned that they know Corky's
game 3 compared to specially games won in do I where they had really struggling this time they were gifted a little bit of an advantage made the most of his credibly well but you've got to say they just look like a completely different Squad went since Karen has the ability to make things happen when he is on pics that allowed to engage the alarm to be proactive and that is something that we did not get to see him playing in games one or two he was more about the farming the team fighting it may have been good individual matchup in the jungle but it just feels like it's dependent ignore to start fights EG depend on Spence Karen and that is why I having them on the Greg it to lease in these types of pics that can be the ones that are practically starting fights and catching a bonus when they're stepping too far forward is so importantI'm curious what this graph looks like it'll be have swapped sides ephelides teams has started to really key on what is a man would not surprise me your thick black was just need to realize that that if and 3 in this composition block get banwick mazzuca yes they are the ones Banning sin away from bang every single game but I think racket is on that to your personally think they know I cannot play Tom kench and maybe they can test the gragas we will see keep my last game Emoji bands of certainly we saw that there was not a lot of power from the Pike in that game that said obviously delivers to look at but it's a no no no no no game and there's always thought process do you emphasize your own strengths or do you attack the your opponent's strengths right and hear it here when I was talking about since Karen and ignorant these two key and Gatorsthe key and gate number for flight with what does he wouldn't be able to do almost anything and be just got out of jail free card for back so 529 that they're opening up the opportunity for ignore to pick something that is going to affect the game to get aggressive and to enable his play style you may end up giving up gragas as a result of that but that to me flyquest showing confident in their own strength saying that hey great you play your best we play our best we're going to winyeah it would be fun to watch for we'll see if this does come through the very end Misfortune or an is going to be the EG pick up they have constantly picked it looks like 14 fighting Indians draft overall we had the the coolest games for example this is this Fortune + Oren of course we know Lauren has great engaged to Akuma should be comfortable here and then we'll go hit our I'm hoping to get in line those off he had some very very bad misses back in the first game we have again this trundle picked into orange restaurant Frontline we again have the atrox into orange soda have a lot of things I ignore will play is a krakus time you've got to go to your own strengths you can't just try to allow your opponents to dictate the draft day off with their picking all the time and you got to play your own game and I do think of this is eg playing their game this is Kumho on something that does not need attention that is going to have relevance in the team fight and dispense Karen on the playmaker this is bang on a strong team playMarksman playing their game and and likewise if you think for 5 foot 10 toward is left about the engage and more about controlling and tracking his opponent will have a great amount of power comes inside Time by reducing the power of Google on the Warren and also few freezing his own tackiness so I do think of this is the most evenly-matched draft it feels like the other theories as far going back and forth okay well both teams have constantly like so far will Seattle breakfast place out so do washing at the break we will see you when the game starts for those you online item or targeting to worth a ganar take away the blood through a conical ready gone if they really want to focus on him they could even bannout the pike but I do think you may want to throw something power of evils way if you are worried about a pic like Victor if you don't think that you have an answer or if that's too too big of a farmer then you can go towards things like that cuz they're concerned is the catheter in this actually the second captain in band that do we have drawn so far I would be shocked if power of evil or willing to go towards applying kassadin so maybe this is signifying that they're not actually staving data that Midland Pick 4 last but that doesn't really do you really have nothing you're willing to play into it because generally speaking there are a lot of bad bad matchups for Catherine you already have a strong early Alan King juggler in the garage so beer is good for us we do you can counter pick a catheter if you're not willing to play the other side of the match up so early but there is a chance to talk to flex register or in the support and that's also part of it end of the day they grab this and will be support last I think it's a hundred percent I know there's a possibility but the counter picking for the TV 2 and then it's saying did you get enough out of it because Victor or some sort of farmmatch of any such a stable midliner exceptionally rare to see him go down like you did in the last game and it's just interesting because you're kind of putting yourself in a situation at 480 where are you getting the most out of red side right side is about having advantageous Lane matchups to me do they have any I guess it depends on this for pick right in and if you go for that support that can you win to be to through that because Top Lane is is a losing backed up I do think that Midland it's just a farm matchup and bought Lane remains to be seen it so it's it's kind of like I'm always disappointed when I see teams go right sided and not get winning match ups and that's what my real concern I guess that for the DG draft but I still do think that they have on teen fight like the draft ended up I realize that I agree with you that's so often the red slides goal is to get good grades but a lot board at least have a great front line has been back but they don't have which are pretty weak terms overall temperature in this game overall in right but I still like for the draft ended up welcome back brace for ESPN viewers does the draft start things like to go to bed at 5 for me to pay Saint traft I do think she has a better job that I liked it a lot and and yeah it mean maybe it's maybe it's a smart read because you're playing against POV and you're saying you're not going to go crazy or just going to go to farm at 2 and that maybe a read more about the teas and unless something that they feel it can be punished there and anytime you're playing you me into something that cannot all in really really have late such as the Bronx you're feeling really good about it so they may have gotten enough out of this out of the Spot Lane last pic with that you mean and that I think going to be a really big focal point of the game Helix Austell be taken by the enemy so Bank Needham play cleanse doesn't have to worry as much about any potential no Fromme son or or roof rebellious and that is going to give him some freedom to to kite more easily he's also very likely taking Nimbus cloak which will help them out in the team fights it's a kite some of these Mila Champions like the triangle and like the atrox do want to point out of course we are still in 10.6. The entirety of playoffs of the most recent not on board with Fair bit so he's going to have a face but I think you're hard-pressed to find a winning match up here against mfu me so I do want to see what EG can do Down Here Without a late and they threw for flyquest here comes the sweet breakfast in Turin placement knowing how wide receivers going to be sent word doesn't know they saw this they won't get to go to XP either and it will allow easy to make good choices but responds to it because this has gone and either way I agree and tells me forward great to have that information even if it's only to say ah crap but at least you know what's going on with see where Spencer and can go but no Greg is starting leashless on his Red Bluff is going to be a lot more slow he is going to be going over towards his opponents blubaugh and and then it kind of becomes how much can you take out of honest jungle right dust removal. We are on this quadrant because clearly they want to split the map they want us to be stuck playing up on that top side where he could get attacked by the date rocks and he's actually looking for a level that was spotted by Ward solo can just have her back yeah he's supposed to level two as well with the wave pushed in weight for a minion now he has the dash with the dash up that you're not really getting that Gandalf to it isn't have a date follow-up has been secured at least able to raid Buffs back so they will have equal Buck house for the question is the rest of the camps could be with me or going to be there first early jungle pathing Yasin by Ward who cares black West cleanly up to Camp Saint Saint torrent as an amazing start or just meant weigh more after getting pushed off you know he's he's losing his is quadrant on the bottom side of all those jungle camps and he gets swatted not just rushing for a trade above he gets spotted trying to do a level to gank that is the low percentage play against the state rock for the little one has died from his own so bench warrant is going to be three Camp ahead at the end of the day because there's nothing for a sincere and even Farm gifts that was not damaged but there's not really any more follow-through and realistically you can recall whenever you want on trundle and the same as well. Not going to really hurt him very much he was going to shut the way you've been but still it's going to be up for a little bit of far lost for words the wave reset button is plus 5 well it's actually pretty bold once I will heal wait to see what else comes out of this one but not a bad start to the bottom Lane mid-wave a farm as well so at least the various Outside Lands are nice but one thing to you before they rushed the aesir Pick 4 but I've been staring level two man for the job but you can hit Level 3 like well before 3 minutes right so that kid is going to think she can hit it like a champ get to to have the leader Refresh on its Red Bluff you just now picked that up so he's kind of bad already here and level four and a half here comes the flight he Dodges a slope of the pillar is going to do the same precleanse comes daddy supposed to burn the flat why not just flashed away over the pillar have to lose both Summoners a repeat game could go well there by bank I think it was pretty obvious you had the flash as soon as santorin actually guessed up obviously thought he could maybe I'll play it or are really make something else happen there but you know when you when you cleanse in that situation sure you move his roof but you're still loaded by the pillar with three members stacked on top of you hitting you to write and day does open up the opportunity for potentially and easy repeat gang okay the flash for Patricia Luckett the route there is no way out for bangs impossible to live in this point onwards they make the kill goes over and first blood comes to wild turtle and getting killed early on in the game a great there from flag left and a really intelligent game dates that wasn't even the answer to that time bottom Lane White getting his bottling to be to First Blood and what it supposed to be this losing match up in what was the red side dipstick for EG that is supposed to be there there big pressure Lane and it is losing yeah oh my gosh bang head Burns Poe Summoner so it's a it's a metal roof that if it's guaranteed kill every time without some of those up I just don't think he could have got out without Splash but it would have been closer at least maybe if you have clams are you can make them work for it a bit more but and we are we are pushing in that at least you don't have rewards the trundle gang becomes very threatening turn volume is not scary if your back near your turret but when you are very far up all of a sudden the pillar becomes a really big deal for any type of champion that doesn't have a dash to easily Escape over it and MF is obviously in that group at what other day we got so without running into the middle Lane Suzuki is a little sick person with power of evil to get spotted. We've been thinking song I think they just saw you was there a little walk down and the day is not going to be too much but he had the time you stepped in the way if he's going to look for the play big deal EGR still probably pretty well Spencer is doing his best. But he's a course at least Builders remaining down a level four have to do kick it hand over the flu Baughman we'll see if he needs you can lick their wounds while and I still look for team fighting the question is going to have another four thousand gold different through the game. Killer was right thing and it just cannot get away to go back to the source and yet again they find that guilt away but there's not forming gold on this Misfortune they're just getting blast and it's bothering by these Gangsta Gangsta been so effective and the fact that they put spent during this far behind time this means that stop farming it out he's stuck trying to catch up an experience and he's still down to level C may have 5 off of this will will see you know he's is still down well over
and if they could actually find a way to sweep through the playoffs by 3oh and every single opponent I would say that would actually make them the best na team ever in terms of a single twitch performance but we know their former players are actually on the other side and Evil Geniuses right now and that would be a whole bunch of Revenge if they were able to take down five 9 here Deputy really exciting to see how that one goes out of course we heard from coach the split report on cloud nine say I had a pretty good feeling on how Evil Geniuses it went like I expected I'm really confident e r v i can definitely beat my old teammates sirico to seem to Victory I mean to clap. Championship last time it was back in 2014 ever has been since it's been filed and populations but yeah 1701 regular season they look just the most dominant eye ever had and it starts to get the priest and Elliot vandeweghe Cloud9 we expect for them but they don't mean to get it yeah no big surprises as of yet in the band phase the Leblon fan is something I had my eyes on to take away from UK testing Dan and 70% of easy games against them one noticeably missing ban right now is Stendra it actually has it been a hugely prioritize can't fight either team but cloudy quite bought and they're just going to completely leave it up for now okay they say hey the most prized bottle enter here is vereist into enough worldwide Misfortune 10th to still be a bit more surprised but for the match of concern to put his valadares when he's played a lot of before at the Tampa gonna steal away from being there as well but it does mean we talk about talk with a Chance of these teams spent Aaron's gragas was used in their win last week as well so getting to play that again definitely be a power supply for EG yeah it's cool it's no surprise that he may say actually share a common view on what jungle is there both amazing Raga says they're both excellent Lee Sims so unless we see some type of new stuff from Lab Rats he did pull out on Nocturne jungle last week more likely though is will probably see a lease in front lever on side by side seems most likely they're having the pantheon that we might do that one come out as well as a highly prized jungler a truck in still locked at the answer to Lauren and then down there and that means we're going to wait and Speedy jungle and bid by later on this is actually very interesting most of the time with in the first phase of pics you'll see the rolls at least Matt but that's definitely not receiving here with the greatest I walked in and no jumper for cloud nine and if CG the MF is something that they're probably likely to lock in here just so they don't completely starving hailee carry pool okay it means we end up matching a little bit here on roads in winter but as you mentioned a mismatch jungler versus support at Rosie watch gun ESPN your heart you are when the game start just you and us we are together again and it means we get to Catholic he would have otherwise no difference anyway so we are covered your next prize jungle pick up pants and band off I mean I do find it interesting how Cloud9 was more likely to prioritize jungle are sorry Top Lane and bought Lanes animated jungle jungle full has been very large but blabber is a player who if you think about where can understand most of their experimentation pick ban it hasn't been the jungle it's basically to spend for the most part the leasing in the garage a show for him but I mean if there are there still Banning out so I'll Lane potential so it's very easy for him to fall back on cloud nine just seems like it was the correct Choice 49 to do with what do it today LED going to probably most likely safe counterpick Borges ukai in the midline absurdly aggressive player top charts in the first Blood C absolutely early game in a PVP sets that said Cloud that has a team of teams in the early game a very through the stupid Tramp as a car to pick to the Spindrift a job you mentioned earlier on despite not being incredibly popular for the a very common pairing with Misfortune they had two opportunities to ban the way they don't care about that they just care that UK doesn't get going if we think about the actual way to ease you would be able to win this game as if they can somehow unlock the UK so batting out as many powerful mid laners if they can and it completely sets up this Tinder pick it's completely Telegraph but it's also about it do I like this but not for this in there as well and I menu end of the day right it's you got a blind pick something sooner is one of the safer pics that get rid of his two most common assassins in the key on it and show us a third we know leblanc's with a gun here as well and I am curious if you look it does have a Nocturne which means you're not going to be an overly pressure against it and where is it going to go with this one kiddos were you able to play a little bit more aggressive if he has the Grog is pressure and also has that immense kill pressure at level six so that's one of the best pics you can do in to Sandra it's just extremely volatile because if you do start falling behind if you're unable to start contesting the wave it can go downhill very quickly and from the looks of it this is also just UK's first yossel play of the split so definitely getting pushed down a fair bit on champion pool from display have a lot of pressure and Nocturne typically not that strong super early so we'll see if that midlane pressure are we really do think bit late is going to be the primary focus of your gap for an easy win his net lease early through mid-game then splitting off on the side could look very good download yes oh great, so we don't expect a ton of early pressure from bladder on the Nocturne gragas probably can punish some of that early game weakness so I I really want to do that turns into I would love to see zouke really pop off but it is going to be a difficult effort if Cloud Nine's on today if they're playing at their level it's going to be a tough fight for EG yeah I mean we saw what the analysts as predicted everyone is predicting a sweep it is what we've seen C9 is 20 + 1 when you combine their first round of playoffs with a regular season record but if you think about the possible ways that you could win which is what kind of all I've thought about for the past week because you're trying to figure out if there's going to be drama here and it would be if they can make it to the 15-minute Mark with even gold against Cloud 9 has had the best first 15 minutes of basically any LCS team ever which does make me a little curious for this Nocturne pick because for the first six levels he's not really able to apply a huge amount of pressure he's mostly just looking to farm encounter jungle so well we'll definitely have eyes in the middle and I definitely tracking what flower does Early Autumn Nocturne all the teams are loading on the Restless take a look at the starting lineups hello and welcome to summoner's Rift it's game 1 of the Winner's bracket final Cloud Nine with 17 and one regular season type the best LPS record of all time people Geniuses stuck in a number 2 seed off the tiebreaker day a reasonably convincing win their first round bracket and this is a massive determine who is the first team to make the LPS 2020 spring finals Cloud 9 in blue EG and red vest and additionally this is extremely interesting just because fence Karen was on cloud nine last year actually won MVP and then three members of that cloud 9 team moved over to ege to eventually climb to be the second best team but here we go come on Spence Karen walk in and no one really wants to fight cuz knowledge doesn't exist and neither team has the whole Squad there and they don't get any little bit of Chip damage down sometimes I can matter little bit of damage can stick and make your Lenny face the slightest bit easier but in this case no harm no foul late invade him through for Vulcan bladder in Spanish they want to see if I can stop bracket starting a blue up would like to get the blue for his first cap and yes and I got a free much dedicated to this if it was going to do a state start at Wolves of his bladder can go to the blue steel in realistically blue will indeed be snowing here early game or the legal temp of Eros who like we would have been able to tell Trey that if we ended up seeing the actual fight I don't think it has a huge impact depending on what happens next in whatever Camp you clear first still gives you level 2 and the Grog s can also go for a fairly early recall either way I even seen thanks Karen what he's playing Are The Champions by panteon actually start wolves just by choice but it does give early-game dollars to see 9 and it limits the options expense Karen hasn't terms of early games which I think is pretty crucial knowing that the Nocturne does mostly want to wait until I was sick and nearly as well as put a trinket Ward down about the Krug camp and with since you're not able to take blue and it's drugs being ordered he's going to be on Vision pretty early on and they'll be able to track okay he's got 16 or 12 we know exactly what he sow topside okay this information has no licorice now nose needs to play around being tank top slide for now though he knows he has time to shut his went in and as soon as that Greg Xbox left you notes to play past with the real indicator of of what's happening is more so what C9 lanes are doing not necessarily that the garage is going to be put behind an auction in prison terms of farming Facebook Junger to take in for camp but the fact that the bottom one is able to push and they can do this because they know Spence Canada path topside after starting blue and it allows them more freedom to play aggressively do you make the first week I'll come through for the midline before too terribly long Misty shelves in the next Villanueva blocks down at the bottom side to help make sure that Scuttle is safe flea control for the drink it down as well but the man was getting a bit limited that can make a Lenny face a bit tough to do we have plenty of farm to catch going to go against her is nearby even say safest gear nearby as well go to spell shield but not disengage car wash out a little bit there's a lot of first-time offense Gary was with daring of flash there but nisky knew he had barrier the whole time very defensive summer spell choice on this end result has been scaring didn't fall for the bait and both people just kind of backed away knob lever and singing to fight over this Scuttle crab is enough to kill a top 12 on the bladder their grades. And yes for now he is totally up to Camp some of that it is worth waiting for more far as both genders have can't respond when you get some more gold picked up thought if to be so incredibly aggressive first trip like bacon and heads up to 1/2 early on yeah I mean you're seeing the early priority station from draft on Bears Tom kench paying off a little bit from seeing I hear without strong they've been able to do a lane and then also just the decision-making from blabber and I'm continually impressed with the way C9 can play these nocturnal early games because they haven't allow grata to apply any early pressure blabber was there the one spot svenskeren want to go to and they were able to get double Scuttle crabs because their bottom Lane and toppling report and because they got some deep words into Krug so just really well done early on to get blabber to level five so effortlessly and now getting that recall the challenging Smite so probably had six very soon probably around 6 minutes or 6:20 depending on how much experience he was able to grab from the lane and then they're going to be Off to the Races I'm pretty much every single Lane looks amazing top continually has pushed your getting licorice able to take a fee to get back to the Lane Sudbury items going to actually have extra money and life deal for an even even funnier mid-game there and we ready stop bottling what's up in a farm still are with more minutes to kill a good time as well try Extra Man in the back steps are so kind of already across-the-board Cloud 9 without a single pill or major objective on the map have a three to four hundred Gold Leaf come through for the first or the lady pays I have spikes and they're ready to go yeah they just have to watch out a little bit about this Path Lane moment for licorice because fence Karen has a spreader up and it's kind of snuck into the garage Aldi Burns to get 1/2 HP blocked Splendid Lane one cake work one game doesn't stop playing burn Crockett salt and also liquor to Splash but now since level won the fight he's moving to River fly to buy broken glasses with as well so that was down there but it's built
one thing that surprised me was actually the four players been scaring that game the defending MVP also the former jungler of Cloud 9 who has been replaced by blabber now she needs to step up in order for EG to have a stronger Canton this year most certainly have been expunged performer even throughout play out the first one and 1/2 game since you know has been good but if you see 9 a league above with band. It is getting rid of grogginess their kind of afraid of that red side jungle pick up their syndra off early embarrass off really in with the hell has been coming through at me is easy cuz I don't think he was playing the way the side so I can work in playoffs those you who don't know is C9 gets head stuck in the first game and inside collection future games determined by whoever lost the last one so EG had side button and they got your shoes blue and already we see a vastly different draft mainly because the band chain so much callista was banned LeBlanc was planned and Olaf were all banned in all available champions for this one that callista very early on was pick and I'm not sure if we're going to see it through your rotation LeBlanc NCG just reverse around its Kumo time to play drunk last night without jungle interventions and we ever see what cloud Diane answer they know topic as the pantheon get locked in that was that blocked in we noticed they were going to flex their mid and jungle spores later now those are you watching on ESPN 300 First to break you to stick around and I also think with the pets Lawton buy C9 so far that's was very passive forestry fiction Cloud 9 and definitely gives easy some opportunity to play aggressive very early on I like the Caravan because the collective terrorist is the most common Lane and I see with Calista is close to set so neither of those are going to be available for EG when I was kind of starting how maybe EG would be able to be T9 it would be if they can get through the early games with Stephen Gould maybe the shock hauling experience of Spence scary as well as put forth of June would be able to find the victory what's happening in this draft is there so it's more like golf but really going to have to turn down afterwards because their pics are going to start falling off if you need it later find some way to just like stiff the front lines together and have no one hit back line forever and that's not okay so I tend to agree it's getting pretty bored I'll be stable knows how good that can be but maybe if you will pops off and you don't listen to get to play League of Legends and every single team fight and then it looks different around 7 how to fix the one that cries yeah I mean with whitthorne as real Tom locked in it's like all of cloud Nine's aggression needs to come from this jungle mid-combo if they do not hurt again I mean gleyber is powered by symptoms of Nocturne not being an effective really getting pissed because he's been able to farm at a fast-paced and effectively counter jungle very well and always hit stick first so that's what they're going for here but I mean like if EG does something like Pantheon Thalia with mid jungle that seems like a pretty devastating truly to prom with anything this key plays made here except his own I have talking about here is just going to play Snow White's coming through with the cats if you have an for sure and it navigate to be brought the tools they are getting the rise. Either way whether it's going to be the pantheon of the tunnel bottom line it's going to be it's going to be interesting and I don't dictate where they're going to be playing through it feels like not worth trying and let's see if I can get some kills into the spell shield is going to be really crucial for blabber again Pantheon in some of these Early Trades cuz if you actually see if you actually spell shield the pantheon W there's a lot of your lethal Tempo Dam itself in terms of how Nocturne get behind and how much of the lethal Tempo timing can fence during walk off into game to shortly we've got it all new draft and it's a lot of early game pressure with one nice little piece which is a hectare rice kills pretty well that just to kick in take a licking team fight and it got trundle and support to siphon off of the tanks that there was a little bit of extra texture and those last two pics that makes me a little more optimistic about the EEG Bob smiley emoji late game but yeah there early game is Wicked Strong you've got a Calista in there for letting face at 6 to go throw the trundle in which is I would argue one of his little weaknesses as a Frontline or is he just have to walk very elegant is around those going to look a lot nicer so go on summoner's Rift Evil Geniuses I are going to slowly running to turn in this series around 5910 start in the best-of-five and I'll also say that they still has been putting in more time than most on some of the more unconventional support fix just because they were really are on on the Losi scte kind of tank for support place out there actually would have get it in some of their grass before it became permabanned so Calista is somewhat similar how to say a Santa in that it can unlock different support pics to work the early laning phase like turnovers Tom pinch turn off snowcast a check or so I don't necessarily think that that's a melee going to get pushed in and then it level 6 plus the trunk and get really cranky by altering orange or the time spent so that might be very good and then the other bit of texture think about how the track played out is Zoe is Miss Keys most played by far V's coaches notice but they decided to ban Cassiopeia Cassiopeia is generally speaking a better Lane matchup Enterprise than most so I'm thinking that he actually wanted this rise into Zoe match up and it's going to be a little bit of a skill check whether or not is ukr net Seafood winning all right well because the early jungle path from licorice getting around near the Red Bluff is going to be a quick invade to get svenskeren basement boards won't even be seen taking the Red Bluff initially especially if he never goes into the front and some of this researching your opponent's whatever habits where the wards go how do they defend their side of the Jungle would have liked to see spend find a way to do that camp-out ever going upwards and never showing on that work yeah I think so he doesn't necessarily know if it's warded and it is hoping to to make sure he's getting away from his Nocturne could be doing a blue straight to Red path for Blu Grand Street to read and he wants to be able to show that to my cousin happened just like as a little bit of security but because you stepped on that Ward it is it going to be totally fine for black look like he's a faster jungle clear defense Karen and licorice might actually fun till the K Street here in Jungle but he is going to try to spend the time to 4 Spence Karen off the way the others should Zoe spell tease flat but that's not crowd control Kumo get to make him you know hide back but I do want to point out that because the wave was pushing away from licorice his minions were denying Mac Mini next electrician to physically down in experience because he went to stop the front yeah but also been scaring his Defender Of A Down to experience three camps the five from bladder right now and blabber can easily take to Scuttle crab in the bottom River to keep roughly a to Camp Advantage so again blabber with an early farm advantage on the Nocturne but it's whether or not Spence Karen can make something work email flax what's ganking Zoe but it could have gone to the flash of Howard room for them and then maybe the Panton follow up as they are bats obviously if it was okay the camps. He's going to be speared he's going to alive but there is all the damage of two games in a row Niskayuna bladder to buy for First Blood big mistake really big mistake from Spence Karen trying to deny the Nocturne a level six path when his entire blue side is up Spencer and can easily just Farm safely as a flash with Patheon who will lose any to choose against the Nocturne Zoe at this point because he's under level so just a really big really game for mistake there by Spence Karen kind of supercharging blabber and misky and Blake and his walk-up they see him he doesn't have health does UK has no Mata so there's no way he's going to actually be able to support them and it's an easy first blood from his be very large V wave hitting Kubo you going to stop a can of any good about your health back then type back of the van is going to drop a car on all side now licorice temporarily actually has lovely he's 5% double knockout number three lights flatbed from the town's been scared but it's not going to be enough because this is why you're on the academy team and licorice has been stepping up throughout this play off he destroy someday in the first round series and now aatrox firstborn smashed as the atrox OR vs. aatrox not to ask her just after he gave up early experience to push send scared out of his jungle and it just goes from bad to worse they might be there because there are three be one who's going to fill a growler licorice sounds the horn finds Binaca blast was going to be there for the beer as well there is no chance to do literally anything for whom he was powerless and he's gone again oh dear oh dear I just not looking like they are relenting at all I mean if you can't teleport up just because he sees a huge wave there that he knows who can't read so he's he's trying to salvage the remnants of that lane call Matt you got to be freaking kidding me. There is probably a massive smile on Liquors in space right there he got away with that one. Just UK it was the model have to see if one of his cues didn't bounce but this was a whole sequence of plays that we have to go back for so this was licorice chunking down Kumo very low before the eventual Pantheon Gates actually comes in about 15 seconds so we might be in for a little bit of a ride you can just see like the clothes trading liquor has conference the whole time he knows his damage he's kept just enough Mana to have this kill lantic you just flashing behind the cue to of the atrox and Dennis is Lil Baby level 3 Pantheon with a blue buff and can't really do anything left to try and finish him off so yeah mm Gold by 7 minutes looking for in Top Lane and licorice won the HR soaring by about twenty CS had some threat Fred ever got a plate by himself 3 on 1 yep he's a he's Off to the Races and Plastics by the way so give Dale and asleep anywhere they can go for the game as they they might just continue to dive off plane because he is The Flash's player but if there's UK's rise for his up I would see and no hesitation from blabber to Alton try and kill him the Flash Players top and mid lane Mercer police are done so that is a defensive operators okay that can help a little bit we have a nice time the bus by City
text coming into the playoffs they had the highest gold differences at 15 20 and 30 minutes of any LCS team ever still think have been this monster that other teams haven't even thought about taking down and so far they've been able to continue with a few different things to try and take this team doubt they picked all early game and game to as the animals dead Brokedown they still just lost they just got straight up out skilled buy C9 and some of those moments self I don't think it's a bad by any means and if there's a chance to run that back I think maybe that will make it happen three times in a row Cloud X Haley Banning away set not allowing these roots equalize the bull top of courses easy losing a game do they want to get your side flush in the against a on blue side you're hoping to the first pick will go well for them because the blue side game was the last close of the dudeplay so far. Clean things up and come through on the EEG sites I think that's definitely a possibility I'm happy that they got rid of the orange since they lost both sides of the ornash up and by changing up their bands C9 ended up dropping them a little bit and a filios gets through the band face For the First Time all series so like this for bang it's not necessarily something that is needing to be super lame dominant they can just turn on later and I'm hoping that you do push the focus in to other parts of the map and really I know it's failed miserably form the first two games but get something going in the mid jungle between Spence are ninjas UK because that's how they need to win dolphin Square looking like he's going back on the gragas had the option playing the pantheon now in the pantheon was picked one of us was banned away this time around they don't they still take set as without their favorite jungler in the now I got to figure out what support they want and they want to bring along side by side they have another strong duel in their urine game three foods you watch ESPN without having to push the brake pedal and I think this is the first time they've actually matched it again because as you mentioned It's a Jungle not there for the side of T9 and atrox already locked-in so even though she is opting out of the Orange versus X matchup they're opting into giving licorice a power PICC and being able to bed also note that like Zoe still up so I do think that maybe EG she just likes to throw a little bit in there like just in case since about a I think something is still in for a doozy rubber bands for stop there going to be pushed down a little bit I am curious what it looks like not on the Nocturne very clearly 591 play the champion a lot a lot of time and they brought out of respect for them so do you want to see what it looks like on someone else did the game's play a little differently we are seeing more fighter band so try to drop to mow down I feel like now Kaiser to the list I don't think it's a great matchup overall yeah that's probably where people goes to be honest and I don't think he's practiced it but the pic I would actually recommend would be malphite Fanatics latest today over in the LEC and you can just Stack Up stuck in a certain amount of armor early that you can stop him from being able to sleep and you be able to alter onto a Beres but that runs into Tulsa problems later because Ben could just go AP varus and you can also consume them off at altamed so you will eventually get out scaled it's going to be hard almost no matter what its I feel like it's actually little, but they banned up the Camille just cuz I don't think that Kuma would win that match up their base me to saying we don't even need this final ban against Cuomo and I think it's a it's a bit of a posture from seeing eye all right so Pantheon comes through certainly a very strong jungler and we'll see what I can do with this one so it's going to be very very rough Pantheon game some of that still has a global ultimate get to anytime he wants you to go see one out of nowhere from thin air and Doctrine a bit more going to grab that one regardless he's digging the top of a pick-and-pop comes through the Top Lane take Pickens yeah it's actually only going to be third Zoe game of the split his one and one on it so far but I think it's needed to take it and oh man if that's see it let's see if this key lock in the rides like if they win the first date rocks or neat rocks rise do easily rise Orion Oaks kassadin casantica. They want early pressure Pantheon Tulia well-known strong do over mid jungle we're going to win super hard early game I expect there is talk 1020 really lame I expect in the early Lane and you got em too and think about how much this team can ship on the map like the global pressure of the Tom Kent being able to take his bearing buddies and then Pantheon Leah flying anywhere they want so much total shutdown to any type of map pressure that is UK tries to apply and split push so what was eegee's greatest strength throughout the end of the split when they're on the big winning streak it was their ability to split the map and do one tree one in every single draft that she is done they figure this out they pick Nocturne they picked on Kent there was throwing the cherry on top with a Julia in this final draft still with eg wins it's not going to be trees Flatbush yeah ever go see if they can kind of make it what happened meanwhile Cloud out of course have a very early game skewed draft I am a little concerned about this feeling if it does mystically get to 28 minutes with a C9 average that you do 1500 gold lead in the first 15 by 3000 gold in the first 15 minutes and then nearly or in some cases from there so I will see what can happen to your Cloud I have the game for breaking out pretty quickly in and just for a little bit more historical context done what she is doing so far in the spring split their only been two other team to ever go 17 and one in the regular season it was 2016 spring Immortals and 2016 Summer TSM 2016 Summer to invest in threes so they actually had more game losses when do teams went into playoffs Immortals actually got out of the playoffs and then TSM went 3-0 in the seventies and 3-1 in the finals with C9 has been doing is there currently 500 in the playoffs and because of the new playoff format wood could potentially go now I know the last time you seen actually went undefeated in an NA LCS playoff was back in the summer split of 2015 when CLG did it in route to their first title so historic stuff to C9 is looking like they might be doing if they can continue this dominance closeout UD 3300 here and we want to find afford a half years since our last undefeated playoff Champion blabber going for early play play Nice List template liquor store Copley ready to go I appreciate the thought for the idea of hey we expect flowers to start them band Raptors let's set a trap for him problem is the Trap was sprung and he wasn't under the little pinwheel the little you know that the battle ever came down he's like on 3 million. Mention the goals of course dropped as well liquor can of soda off the wave yeah and they actually gets Diesel's exhaust on top of all of it is so strong level one that I mean you can't LC9 is going for the jugular likes counter jungling Raptors that early in the game as the pantheon is like a big bet about where Spence Karen going to start an actually was wrong with the fact that didn't get punished is a little bit miraculous cities take me to tractor the jungle he's probably doing you know Raptors read drugs than topside so I'll just take your top 10 before you do it we expect a faster speed yeah yeah you know he can certainly try but for now blaberus more than comfortable in his jungle pathing and with his Raptors of to Camp gone back to clear a flapper is Pats have been awesome what a lot of times Crockett's is do is L-3 Camp right side recall to get their Predator boots because then their initial gang is still high threat but blabber having discharge I can get full control the Scuttle crab if you really want is not the highest experience play but will be a higher mattress place you could actually double Scuttle in this case to Dino's as I settle for this game and that is the rock hitting the back of the head he just walks away Dead all summer's gone and a wave crashing into the turret that spends going to show up to pick up and they know it a full box light clear and take whatever you want and get to kill mid you say has an exhaust do you still want to take that trade but this whole series has been playing Lane like he has someone can for him and she just hasn't it's always been blabber there instead of Spence Karen and that's what happens yet again spell attempted fight down here or basil unable to block the piece of mirror from the vents of things would it have to be to have to walk down the bottom but poor guy got the clear midlane and take Walton look and now stuck talking about a side light flash pick up there Vulcan who is reasonably Tanki why do does nisky why was going towards the back side has been want to rejoin his old lady's going to be pushed back when he will stay alive EG make the fight work as a Botley and what a huge stop that is for EG if we go back to the whole series what usually happens the first batting happened and then they try another early gang in a little bit of desperation and that fails to this time it's actually work they played this extremely well from the get-go so they don't Predator until he's actually out of fog so they don't have time to react they get through it and look in the patient has been scared of body slam early right they know that that's wrong son is still going to be on spend so post watch they can still kill him and then why was little bit greedy he's trying to save his powers what tastes unlock him before he can get his Empower Steve and brush him down from that moment show a little bit of a Miss play from blabber for sure they had been dead to rights and they finally converted play let me go back to the rest of the bath now so I can take a look and look at the facts that kills buster gold because they're winning the length by so much is 19 tsp in the bot Lane 10 up and topside with again Liquors going early cold to make that cash in later on everything Google possibly could look at the depth here and there doesn't matter Cloud 9 or still just slobbering the early game he was going to send it to take the Dry Falls Bend schools at Fort Lee there's more yes I mean is this is why it's so hard to be Cloud 9 as they always find the way to apply the most pressure possible we do have to keep in mind what we talked about in the draft if this gold stays close in to the late game EG will have a chance because of the hanky next to Poppy can bring in the late game and more importantly just the immense damage of a late game of Fellowship we protected by Brahm so yes seen I had the little bit of a misstep with getting to Des bottom but their foot is straight back on the gas pedal and licorice please summer, is push off the wave has take a long walk back and now in the mid lane as the rest of the squad there. There's the knockback nothing you could to actually get a jungle bright like this is how Pantheon jungle is supposed to oppress the opponent mid laner just UK falling prey to the second straight Pantheon game Lita's back to 1300 I feel like we've seen these numbers before this stage of the game Cloud 9 doing it again and again and again if you had to push down the middle Lane that's why do you want to defend midline would you like this wave of minions here as I'm pushing it down it looks juicy as a hundred gold here right now to safety and this is where things get really hard for EGT
play offs after game 2 just cuz it looks like there was no way that this t19 could be slowed down and mention the last time Blue's Clues so we know they're at least a little bit mortal it took a lot for you to win that game they were down over 5000 gold able to clutch back-to-back device to take it back so now she has retaken blue side there's no way e g is getting that first pic of Kelly O's and let's see if seen I can pull them out without sealed his records stays still make it a convincing Victory gear they still had the best of any team in the league Fife are fine but now he might say Hey will take your time difference is Ben barres you heard the animals kept talking about the damage permanent difference between been and being last game and it was over 400 because really spent didn't have any impact in the game and okay they would Crank That is Provera to that is your work going for Kent and trying to get picture of him again and see if I'm not having more engaged to lose more weight to play aggressively on last game but they faltered by mid-game a mom cat so we got here once again a decent cop vs jungle if those UFC on ESPN commercial break for the stick around and last time we saw the atrox blind in the second phase of band was actually last game of the two bands of Cloud 9 throughout was Renekton and Camille but the poppy actually showed a large amount of spectrum is so if we're looking to see something similar from this round where liquor she trying to get has been Avenged of possible that's what we see but actually since EG will have first dibs on whatever midday want if they opted not to counterpick they're just romantic Azucar yeah I like the slaughter band continues on a whole lot of sense I want to see what is licorice lose that match against boom players who won their first best advised to get here gold difference in the first 10 minutes of the game the only play with a week laning phase regardless of that like egms you were still able to pick up with that's good but I did leave your licorice going to win that anyway with the caliber flare you are still Cloud 9 prefer to Spanaway or let's neutralize licorice last game and 10:25 afterwards yep completely agree it's it's working in the favor of EG most likely to allow promo to play weakside and still be effective when it comes to the team fight phase 4 really going to see the rest of the scene on, come together here they banned out many mid laners and now have two blind pick something for misky misky had a really diverse champion pool probably have to bring me here so we won't be able to play a male a champ like Diablo Warner Elliot yeah I mean like Spencer Diana what you got time yes. That's the one and it's it's technically Affleck's pic to if they really want to stroll ramble top and let the atrox gomed depending on what does UK decides to match him with so let's see have had to be a little bit different is this is the first draft person has had a true answer for LG split push last game they had an overwhelming amount of split push answers with activate the vulnerable in team fight but the Nocturne band here to Tom kench take away means it's 9:00 is actually the stronger team in team fights and zouke might be unlocked to get a little bit more split pushing done even get to that stage that personally I would like to see Cloud 9 switch the locations of liquid to see in this game by the crumble coffee is pretty abusive everyone else but she has a great time citing her I think also a check to look pretty good in the Echo you can at least get away from the Sun cages so the players are going to stalk Champions against fine keep Liquors and more reps on it smells like feels players flop Lane I mean it's definitely possible it hasn't been something to see 9 has really done any of its generally they're the team that swaps champ rather than swap player last your Tod experiments a little bit was swapping Clair Lanes in one of the I think the third-place Play-Off match but more largely since I do think it will be nisky in the mid lane here this is a really interesting matchup because there's actually a lot of debate about whether or not Echo as a counter picking to rumble we had this earlier on in the year when I think it was p o e play crumble into Echo smashed through here on in the year though over in the LPL rookie had played Echo into Rumble and actually gotten multiple solo kills on him so there's definitely some skill match up their Echo pen at some point smacked the wave clear of Rumble but more importantly if you can get into mid game with equal items Echo starts winning the side lane so that's what you doing again it's going to be about whether or not that mid jungle can stand up for EG in trying to set this kid behind we have to see right away we're going to have a pretty standard looking early game we've seen a lot of a lot of invade these early game usually late invades around you know 128 and you suddenly walk-in look for the play had a couple of counterpunches both sides and as lava comes topside with creeper there they could easily see this ward in ghosts or the invade the ECM do so often actually gives the experience and the extra gold over licorice at the Smart play when one person to each other person feels about you both got the goal for the ward and let's see if we can pull up something devastating on Spence Karen here because Allah is one of the strongest early-game duelist in the game and also one of the fastest clears so he would have an opportunity to really sets been scaring behind if you can predict the right calls and take a large Camper vans and do it again I looked up as you're messing up Midland Magic looked up what are you online computers for the expected remorse Echo match up 1.3% less often than expected which means that they tend to be in solo queue 1.3% of additive when we don't get me wrong but in general at home play the Flames. Pretty on that a lot of really game push also knowing that his own jungler has swept out the red buff I'll be gragas so he's not worried about an early game Predator games as of yet but the echo at least not since it's kind of favor but if you're thinking about what's the more common propik it's definitely will happen here and as we go through the very early parts of the game we're going to have a small quick to can't believe parole office is expected no up against course. Steal away some pants I'm curious how much more efficient blubber can be as the camps are responding there is not a level before the Olaf they're both going to be 3 for the Scuttle butts so is the crack has been as leverage drops towards the way he's got the schedule in the correct size and I want you to stop that fella play yeah just tons of overwhelming lost power but it's Penske I can sneak in the right spots you try to go faster than blabberbuzz leprosy hurt but they found the back and forth both teammates have be relocated to have to do the predictive lash Genie feels like we can follow through and I'll fight them inside of windshield for Suzuki but this can trade right back after it and win that prescribe is blank Highly Questionable Bodyslam there by 10 scared to go in when bladder is right there with the level Advantage so I think I lucky to get out of that was just a flash burned is big and pretty cheeky with those trades in the middle and time to react well to cancel okay pictures almost killed afterwards but he stays alive for now but knows he has geekin by the way licorice walkthrough The Vision radio suspense care as blue cakes at the end you really just wanted to shut out the way because I don't I can't see the exact experience Barber chance he could have his stick there was a hole in the bottom Lane home an interesting what what could have been a really big moment for did you say I think it's not because he's still lost a big waves only got 20 CS it at 5 minutes and now they might kill licorice who burnt plastic kill finally a cake of the topside is rewarded a great then the knockback words stay safe keep the farm going but easy of ethical to kill their only son to go down they're still in it as they are still in the series after picking the skin off for me to watch a silica one more time to level 4 vs. level for Misty wants to Finish dish of so he can reset but he actually doesn't get hit by the return on the echo q but still ends up losing the trade despite bring the night so you could see what a dangerous game he was doing trying to shove them back away but changes and get the kill bladder ever aggressive actually out of the brakes is gold more snacks down to the bottom side Sven and Vulcan field they're both down here in this matchup with that kills but it's up to us to see which got to feel nice and shoving that way even walk around yeah and the greatness of our observers to catch always blitzcrank hooks makes it feel like Vulcans Landing everything down bottom that a big point of power for C9 bottom Lane and is kind of pulling blabber towards that side of the map for the overall control of it just like it sounds good but it is definitely still in it I mean I can get this place going on I feel like Spence here is going to Safeway farming to level six and unless you know can orchestrate a dive bottom here with Rumble off easy might be able to stabilize I think we have a really big moment coming up if if C9 price to use this current middling push from Rumble and do something bottomley I guess I could find a friend right now yeah I guess no no big play being done right now what is the oldest to come through it to be very soon but the Cloud 9 dueling down here Spencer and licorice going to trade blows Hilton from space but just Evite come through when's The Equalizer but they know he can find his way back over the wall so not going to have to just get to do get rain gauge points of damage does d as liquor Strikes Back has COPD and now back to the slow mode going to slowly make his way back over but will 6 on both drunk just bite the camp different Spence care if it walked away and see what's going on but doesn't even have to burn ultimate and I think he was losing this Rift Herald anyway after Spence Karen got Junk to work as lube up a really weird feeling I have in the series where we keep saying like Osteen on is technically have on this play what it feels like they could have been more ahead on the place so maybe you should feel happy about it you know what I mean because you're insecure and misky was able to all back to the wave to continue to keep pressure up and seen I just hasn't completely run away with it yet and just weak side poppy is still unkilled right so there are scaling up in these important parts and yusuke still even gold with misky so at least he's he's game plan is still intact because I group your point right to the one to the one hand we've been kind of tempered we've been given this pavlovian response as well but here's The 3 Tails out of why is it not three kills the bell rang what do you mean by the same time 3 where was a 5000 change the texture to games every single time but anytime or C9 are not closing down if he doesn't believe you like well okay maybe they really are just blowing down or teams of freaking out a little bit or yeah and I talked about this for a lot of split when
series that I really think Golden Gardens had a really really hot surgeon the very end of the split flyquest did have a rough and tumble off the Evil Geniuses but scum expected dates in this evening if we could catch up really quickly golden Guardians even though they're coming in at the lower seed to this match the last time around it was that week. Story of the entire weekend because he went 300 on it. Golden Guardians here so I expect that you know the Zoe as well as some of these support pics to be the focus very early on hereyeah I think it's important to watch for right now we're seeing Golden Gardens put out a fairly typical syndrome and more and more and more overtime that Sandra is being banned away very early on in the series offense against blue flag with an intelligent lie so getting rid of who he's content and FBI both played very well on Guardians as well I think those two carries got to keep your eye on generic early round pick flyquest can start with the air and they actually lock-in aatrox first pick for solo just as a versatile blind pick a little bit surprised you actually thought they were supposed to love it more towards the bottom half of the mapyeah I guess it really want school to have a good one and one match if I think in here to be honest these are few players who have played several years but finally I think to themselves on Sullivan topping to get them. Tell her I think he has been a better performing top cleaner than Viper and black racer kind of solidifying on that being there their style tickets in to be correct for them and with him on a truck to drive to play or he's got the highest First Blood rate of any Taco Bueno in the LCS until you take the aftermath of them liked or could be fully that one out out of nowhere with the first pick right now you mention for bottom line it can also be flexed Utah playwe both make the other one immune and it gives you a whole bunch of playmaking around the dragon early on into the game meanwhile flag with this diet and rakan racuchy look pretty easily. Way through any parents comes the Q Telegraph and all of that and in general I feel like there's enough ability here to survive if you want to and if you get a good engage on Calista you can win the two on two should be very exciting bottomland a lot of power on both sides I will say but what was the provides a good way to use turmeric with an ultimate so you know I feel similarly on a level of skill involved in this matchup if the blade collar on the Callisto which is difficult to Cabo you can take him down that gets a lot more difficult level six months that are can multi the Calista but sometimes you can even before that dropped Dorn shows up once again no surprise to anyone who's been watching professional League of Legends for the past two months even with the slight nurse that does Bill scale extremely well isn't is going to allow some more power into that Calista that you're talking about to get a little bit more stats by upgrading items best-performing junglers he was number to All Team voting so absolutely you stand out so far this year and I think hands-down the best player on the soft Life West through the Bandit Zoe golden blue on a budget into the very very end of the split part of that third part of that when they got in flyquest as well as campeon top-tier reflect but ends up being probably a jungle man of this case so it does mean Golden Gardens get count to pick and mid-length they have off at the Oregon top leading cause of death in the bottom line here is going to look pretty good fly fishing the jugular and then Wyclef they have had power vehicle on LeBlanc previously and he didn't do poorly on the champion per se but it did feel like the team didn't play that well around this type of Champion Power of evil as a midline player highest damage per minute of any player in the ALCS usually is on nothing's like Victor are you fixed long-range waveclear high damage output later on with long you do have to control Vision a lot you look for these pics the first higher-risk boobs but one thing that I would say I always do like seeing leblanc's pick later when they know that there's no easy point-and-click answer to that poke if you Distortion in and you know that you're going to be able to get off your combo on the Block becomes a lot easier towards the late game where people sometimes feel like she falls off because it's harder to navigate to you by looking at the school dance audience lineup he goes in for the distortion definitely green has got a huge Telegraph jobs going to be telegraphed list enteric take forever to get that to go off as well so yeah I think our people has a playground through to play with on that very elusive LeBlanc I I think as their best player I think he is well equipped to make good mousse but but you're right again to the point that the team fight promise of the one specifically is not quite a sight that said so we've been playing well I expect they got to the atrox I think adibatla you got xayah rakan that's going to have great late games Gilling as well so this took comp where though I tend to agree I did Pee-wee Is Awesome on control Mages Auntie fight Mages the cop at least supports playing LeBlanc both on their side and the opposing side this should be a fun way to watch for about to get ourselves into game is going to be really excited to see in this best-of-five who's going to strike first blood in this battle loser is playoffs will be there in summer but they're seasonal otherwise be over first team will be eliminated from playoffs here today who is it best-of-five starts off here with some pretty heavy scaling on the top half of the Guardians as well goldenglue actually as a mid laner has the highest jungle presents difference which means that he gets Camp a lot less by enemy jungler but closer does spend a lot of time 3:15 around that Midland at least enough to be within range of warding rounded laying in thank you for Golden glue so we may see that come into effect here because LeBlanc and recs I always is a pair that you expect to look for kill pressure and that is going to be something go to glue will have to deal with it's one of the players with a few of those solo death stats Stephen the case it's fun to look at ten of the historic stats of the team know that all these teams have played a full regular-season you can kind of take a strong look at how exactly they play the games out Golden Gardens going for an aggressive invade toward the bottoms how to kill suddenly Center who wanted to start red buff maybe doesn't get you using ignore and while to wait around and maybe they were engaged in the red who he spots in Turin they should expect that you will Lane in fact is FBI shows they know what the 3 on 3 right now I'm more than just the one with all the windows. We could you don't screw it we're going to present Acres Campground it's worth more gold and a camp and did not the worst thing the world but closer this video thing I see he walked by the only at 1:30 right there where did go to Bible Camp has been very good in the early game he quite frequently has gone for these types of invade stealing away first Red Bluff their bonus is purely a champ select invade for Golden Guardians they had to Stronger level one on the bottom half of the map with charging Calista tarek and so they're able to fully flyquest off of it central line start the crugs while they're taking the Red Bluff and then he transitions into a very quick Raptor Camp should be still be able to get level 3 on on his blue quadrant meanwhile closer already level three on the Jarvan will look to see what sort of early plays he can make a deal has actually won charges for standing still oh nice reflux Center and gets me through this, but it's not going to happen if you take a look at the fact that well close has extra board kill the scent when is going to momentarily be up a camp with that one going down cake was going to come and finish out on rafters to your butt and it had a pretty decent start your both sides yeah I remember not all camps are created equal as the Raptors and wolves are a lot less experienced so even though that does show there is significantly more experience in the other camps golden blue still get this black horse even though Bowser was there hovering still there cuz he sees them on the right side that says it's still has it find the bottom side and The Roots will be a pretty big hit of the day of those are both in pretty equal spots got a point out a small spot to the flyquest do over there is more gold left there's more CS for FBI task lights that shouldn't be too bad but yeah sure to the information asymmetry Centron Stood Still used for fighting back and forth to the with the early lead up here not you were talking earlier about how aggressively as a battle back and forth to Golden Garden their midliner and their to bottling players are all in the league and they are usually time for Saturday night in Fort Worth and it's still the case here and close to sender on Beltline yep and night now they're daring them to come to these minions but look out defensively ignorant tortora playing they let some of those arrangements to actually just die to the autos and don't overextend their as closer was hovering behind the golden Guardians my gold and blue walks by a ward to spot up see OK the blast plate is still alive so santorin didn't jump over the wall and take that no tunnels either so you know that Craig's the other safe for you no problem but is still have to keep my key is Flash list had to run back in a bit his boots to be available and doran's blade spin toward waiting in the wings and there are several can't stop this actually three left to clear the land but then you dive golden glue damage this is where we expect the focus and recs I are always looking for kill pressure and having flown that flash that is where the repeat King should come for so it's up to you closer to help out with some of the wards to see One controller in closest inventory right now and during the time that Valkyrie is down for Golden Globes he cannot step up to the minion wave so he have to play defensively state that asterisk Thorin does take the opportunity do after the mid lane pressure game do you know have power people pushing the waves and take the first dragon all right and thanks for having a pretty good start to your overall they got some fresh from the bottom line okay then go downstairs for a little bit but they got the pressure down there it's a good start for them over indoors is completely match with clover in farm of the top is Leading Men leading a little bit in Farm Heroes well but and the minions get kind of fresh back and forth we've got a fairly close game state where Golden Gardens are up gold from assertive random antler resource if it's right now ACF leave the bottom line is he's carrying that mostly about the dragon there is more pressure on stand for in to create action and get something done here in the early game because that's you transition sports team fights there's so much more to fight utility that you get from Jarvan especially since professional driver in 3 months of all go conquer Cinderella fairy tanky build and then you have your knock up from EQ plus you have the cat play some quick drink so much do the teen fight that's why this is one of closers most played actually is a jungler for the team of the week and pressure which a c fuse and then transition into a very useful teeth by starter and Hans are getting pulled back by The Chainsmokers. Their pits continue fighting the top light has a brand of estriol to start the match of obvious you're going to go on Orange and soft enforces the tank first without one major I certainly are on the top side I do want to point out that one of the very very worst first tell percentages in the league date historically have not prioritized as well or at least they have not won those fights that you can see why isn't a sock still going down to the Berkeley Stags are has roamed up but cannot talk to get top of that running all the way over she doesn't text with does run up on top of things like this word they got to give that one up and we'll see if and when Soul recalls as sponsors Orem comes down to bauxite but he can t be up there when needed and that I really like bringing up that sack because it's an issue
Gardens play Avery T fighting opposition they can you really heavily off of Jarvan jungle that was in team fights but ultimately power of evil just took over the game on the Block I went and looked at the year-long top board meeting worldwide LeBlanc 11 damage permit across over a hundred games do the half times the professional average absolutely massive RJ performancethat was when they were on blue side now it's like what that guaranteed counter Pick 4 Midday and if they want to hold their LeBlanc or did they made fixed till later in the week off the table flyquest do not want to deal with that once used to be a band here as well as respect and it's around afraid of Bengay to get to work on an exterior that focused on this bottom Lane using their early draft picks to get a strong bottom lamp for the fence though really like lyrics right now really strong Lane conditions quite well with a DSebring on top of it all right and I got to wait on the support pick up right now we don't really expect to see some like there is stearic but flyquest do really really like the atrox enforce Polo he was pretty lame down in the previous game with pressure and honestly been pretty good team fighting over all that didn't find a pillow kills didn't really see a lot of Roman up to that side of the map but end of the day we're going to see if there is a chance to sneak in the jungle or a middling counterfeit as gold golden blue Bureau in week. I to get them neutered in the play on defying All Odds. Blue has some spring split I do agree with you perfectly think you to try and get that in round one that you have effective I'm looking for these bubbles over the wall to find pics in the mid game going to be quite well with the dolly forward on top of it we're going to work at Vera South Kent let's grab the Blitzkrieg let's York the time can bin22 valores a teammate the safety's a two-for-one deal will kill them both if you really want to go swag you can collect the full the blitz right at the hooks and get double distance stop Windows if he starts with an angler and Pantheon that's a juggler and a half are they just installed doing so much you can make a fist power shots after trying to get a lot of extra pressure when you got a blitzcrank light off. Halfway there just so many options here for standard form to shine through and do that is one of the top junglers and he's been putting in the work Pantheon we have to fight fights are both incredibly powerful throughout the season and we send her closer number to All Pro junglers this split in North America do Footlocker on tank Duty as well. Malachi comes in afterwards chatterpix freak a red cypress like West in this game they wait to see the Zoe and then used as a red spot over and over on you fly with a showing power of evil very confident in our people doing almost half of his team's damage point something percent it's just ridiculous scale up a little bit later in the game doesn't go offensive quite as early as LeBlanc who can do this time in the apply Quest Super Carry power of evil initially about power of evil it was about wildturtle ignore more or less what it what you want you heads up giving them the control to go for the early Drake it was solo honest when the 101 top link with the priority pick on the atrox and then yappy we basically farmed equal Diggins goldenglue hit me. In the mid game and PeeWee took over the game if one who does not find a way to punish the cast in this closer cannot find a way to punish Power Bill Cassidy it's going to be hard-pressed to find a way about this before he's seen today that pee wee can take a mobile the semi assassin or maybe just pure assassin and just take her to the game with with mobility in Target selection alrighty so all the summoner's rift shortly we're going to go as we wait for a buffer to build up for competitive Integrity since again in real time there was a remake on the game but I'm definitely excited to see if you can come out ahead on to this one I think now KY is definitely underrated tank clear the pro teams have it 80 or below the organ that was what Hunter played in the first game is what flag was abandoned in this one but ultimately Malachi should be I think a very strong pics I think he has a very very reliable engage he's really really Tanki you don't get it yet but I think he's very strong I think it will look good overall in this game I want to see if I could be some impression that I really want to see if close I can get it at midlane can land a couple of games because kassadin before level 6 does not have good mobility and is a gank magnet and I want to see those Gates actually land completely agree before the Cassidy gets level six and has access to the extra Dash from walk leasing is very good at attacking the champion has pretty good attack damage early on in the cast of them's got very low armor so if so we can land above 11 or try and help set up something then they can attack the kassadin but the power of evil plays it intelligently and also stand for in on Pantheon covers mid then that can get very dicey cuz you overextend Pantheon is very good at turning those around yeah I definitely Washington jungle match up a lot we had the first name start with a well-timed invade by Golden Guardians down the bottom side of the map they for Center on off his red they forced him to go to Craig's end of the day the two jugglers is traded camps back and forth and neither got a great gang soften till they be 13 minutes or so and when we had that first Blood topside back kind of started the ball rolling for few we were they kill off Han sir but honestly it was it was that about to fight for his work clothes are found good knock UPS be found good oldies to it's a lot of people in bent over and found good Smite these turn around these different they're incredibly incredibly early-game focus a comely pressure Focus the one caveat being the same toward August Pantheon should look really really good in the mid game looking for side leg pressure if someone tries to match power of evil in a side lane Pantheon comes flying over the top kill every time I all right let's get onto the wrist and they are ready and this is going to be an action-packed early game as well everybody eyeballs on the blitzcrank I want to see if there's a level one from flyquest some sort of delayed invade I do see a sweeper on ignore that is a key component when you do have plans to go for these early invades because very often teams when they see an opponent blitzcrank will leave a lot of defensive Wards early on and they will expect those moves big. They tried to bury us and turn the corner and show themselves but yeah yeah Giants as they just barely walk right back out as bi completes his recall comes back to the map and it looks to go towards that bottom side no Advance on portable spot any jungle exits if clothes are goes with say Red Bluff to invade it's going to be spotted ultimately we don't have it really a bad by flyquest a little bit pensive. Golden Gardens might do and don't choose to risk it is going to end up getting leashed up at the top it's going to be hot after giving him that easy one up there so look into a similar thing least percent or it will say a charge to do more damage early on so it'll be a faster first Ampersand children did it will be supposedly sick all right top side starts for both of them then we kind of do expect early actually done bottom so we might as well talk about that lane like Swiss Francs into tahm kench pretty obvious reasons that it's pretty easy to hook into tahm kench even if they do go over really bad. Pain DPS over the top to take that first trade with Guardian But Here Comes the first seal for movement speed and it's all in who he is well that's going to be your friend to just 5hp but what a great start flyquest ornament First Blood yeah. Like his dad Progressive quite so much anymore because jungle different pantheons sand pouring we had a highlight on him looking for early place you go straight from topside Red Bluff all the way fly down to the bottom side where we are looking for some bottom Lane accident and flyquest do not disappoint that got a Calista with Franklin and a Pantheon jungle this spell early aggression since 4 and wait for who he and FBI to feel more comfortable after the tongue lash is used Stick it to splash ride in they go straight for various they know that there's no possible Valor any other spells because it's a level 1 somm can't use this Sunday the tongue lashed so they get the second flash out on top of it and this is setting up a lead here for wild turtle in eggs are with the Calista blitzcrank know some of the spells for anybody on the bottom half of the map so that means junglers will be around at least you're not going to land the key we of course have midlane pressure for gold and blue so it shouldn't be expected as level of play but passable lose the lathe really got it means that the birth control to get Scuttle control that's at least a little on the board for Golden guardians but this is going to be a rough one to come through Pua is honestly farming nearly equal you can see 2024 in CS that's completely fine for Castleton Augustine First Blood bot Lane looks great in very early looking like we're poised at another flight facilities and this time around they're the ones with the bottom line control in with the Calista so you would think plan for flight Quest should be kind of similar to last game where you can use dragon's head towards one of the early dragon souls the only caveat is that you were just going over different when I sit and really does need more time to scale goldenglue here on the Zoe should be able to help out with keeping a lot of vision in this area of the map and its Rich really only the early kill and the possibility of blitzcrank Calista play making that kind of sex that up I'll see if I can keep happening as they are just watching each other Drive the paint than clear the waves of the topside again and it I mean realistically right at the bank no one should be dying here the next level or two probably could Lane well at all your sing solo start to relieve pressure in it's got a man at all in with still don't have that constraint he's doing you know better and better as time goes on and we're going to close or she try for a play I'm not sure what's going to work one Trickshot and afore solo pops really like that set up from hanser that's that's an experience Malachi play right there
put the ball in Hunters Court allow him to get counterpick allowed him to look for slow push or do something because goldenglue as well as the bot Lane they have been significantly behind it feels like they are getting outclassed in this Siri and Golden Gardens is going to need to really make something up if they want to have a chance to come back feels like the strength for Golden Gardens lies in roughly two spots it's closer to being an incredible jungler who is good A Team fight again taking over a fight The Landing phase. So much gold the guardian strength but giving him a backline team fight like a failure Suites by the waist and everything okay at 2 to find your liking damage and and it was okay that kind of worked out the problem was all the gorilla game stats against losing the weight. You choose the side because they lost games you say shows red they wanted red side, but you have to believe they're champ select plans were in place to stay and it's interesting right you know you can go rest high but then you're going to blame pick your top liner anyway after a kind of pass work out a couple times in a row yesterday truck is a strong blank pic was very clear did this kind of housing through working giving over-the-counter octans to Blacklist they will have the ability to kenefick mid lane tier if they do so choose to Golden Gardens don't do that in the first round in Odyssey Blacklist expect him to dinner prep rental matchups against cinder cone board is going to be against in Turin playing and solo CT wish I was felt like I was his best Champion when he had been a Mainstay in the ALCS in previous years he have been really really strong on the GP very consistent player so I'm going to be a Guardians Matt's jungle or midir yeah and it's going to be looking like matching jungle the Olaf however that is going to be locked in so we have some decent option C we've been answered mid laner and unanswered. We know Sandra can be flexible what are the big things to talk about with Sandra Lee counterfeit cat and this is something that will you still have Guardians are on bedside they can still wait till 5th to do it later if you're willing and throw play this year and we'll see with him. But I am expecting in quite some time he's been pretty regularly just sticking to your Marksman and kind of going for that song also some pot Lane Focus pants here come out from Golden Guardians and it is Nautilus as the takeaway perhaps thinking that you don't like what if they want to go for a lower Mobility Mark Smith and they don't want to have that Nautilus paired alongside the various which gives you a really strong Ellyn scraps are trying to push them to work them constantly more defensive options fresh also does signify that they're not worried about anything that goldenglue can bring out they want to take away from the good aggressive pairing that Ferris does a bush golden Guardians 2 playlist it more expensive I think on that bottom Lane which to me is telling telling me that fly and utilize that in the Sandra takeover Nora Midland kill the move to the sidelines and not necessarily have to babysit theft Autumn Lane by Benny Boyd threshing Nautilus forcing out something like this Braum's yes there are two boxes there but it's not the same sort of reliable engage that something you're like this Nautilus or fresh could bring Waka Flocka okay well I'm exactly that's why I quit hovering LeBlanc what is your hike down bear flyquest 1700 e on the bot Lane Dudley syndrome Pike we weren't sure what any of it was going to be it also means that don't Guardians have very very few aggressive engaged to a soaked in comes the Spy list to steal some kind of Engagement and maybe start things off with various lines and arrow or Silas you do steal the pantheon in this is the same idea how do you say ginger doesn't have a dash to be very susceptible to all ends from somebody's hook South Champions Lake Drive to Nautilus so. It's been using that and they do have to ignore again on a playmaker we had some really good on this throughout the year one of his biggest I think strength is his Champion flexibility there's a lot of initial upfront Bearse on this squad now when you have LeBlanc when you have syndra these are such a what is just need to get somewhere to 20% so that Pike can dunk come and start that fight off on the right foot if you can get that first reset Pike can completely take over a fight and they do have a lot of ways to get that initial burst out to get someone low to set up ignore Force except in this fight alrighty well we are on the Ritz Cancun final game of the best-of-five flyquest had a fight of a first game win but absolute Slaughter of GameCube including goldenglue playing stylist here in the mid laners they are going to walk by a horde of us invaded in dark and very cleanly walk away from it all right it is also a hail of blades on the Pike a lot more of recently allowed Pike to have the ability we hook someone didn't wear when you start them look at these kind of three quick Autos out to have more of front damage feel to try to get someone in to sq range and friend that will all in Patrol he wrote The Flash they found that first to make it happens that would that was pretty floppy from Turtle they knew they were there and he just kind of wandered up anytime you have Brahmin these level 1 invades you got to respect the Q if Brom Q hits and that passive stun get sprach as it did you were going to go down and her was unable to flash a bronc you unable to flash a stylist just really way too late on the summary of usage and as a result stats first blood not only given over to Golden Gardens but give it over to FBI yeah usually important right here we saw a level 1 level 2 diver the bottom five and centering game this time around though to be fair FBI is also Flash and so here it is he gets slowed up by the band tag by the Bronx you vent a golden blue sun and golden flashes in for that auto-tune rock that prompts unlock the team actually flashing and finish that up very nicely done now looking to set this up there pretty close to Tower but remember there is no flash available and we'll just load and yeah just a little bit then right there when is farming heavier you stole the chickens find the X backwards this isn't a pretty big world of hurt they got ignored flashing night but he does nothing that should turn and walk away closer basil I've ignored left alone Gallade Turtle can't be back as Lane and he can cash in on the way things for him if they can do it takes a bunch of shots and he won't lose too much he didn't even lose the cat that they actually were able to complete it down there but still all credit deserve to your five golden Guardians a really great start Turtle makes the initial mistake getting over First Blood being down that Summoner and then they realize there was not able to get to level two prior to that dive coming in he was Trump's very low so he couldn't do a lots of support turtle and turtle without that Flash doesn't have another defensive summer they have no heel down there there's no exhaust down there so it's easy to get that damage down and take him out and now you know no flash no TP his base only netted him a fairy charm obit danger who he thinks he has the shield still and try to keep the wave away from the trip delay house is going to kill that down my gold grabs done for FBI only a fairy charm for recall timing me the FBI is far stronger than pretty sad when you have a 125 gold fairy charm vs Goldberg pretty rough stuff there for turtle but we'll see if you can actually just kind of skill it out and thankfully he is going to change in the house of very good way of clearing can play Ghost early defensively he is going to go back and just grab them in a crystal and boots and it was able to push it in so of a spot as previously what and meanwhile Top Lane midlane both going great yes there is quite a bit of farmed for pickups wait and see exactly how it had sold his butt 38 cs221 temporarily is a monstrously 4GB he gets the first dates on his Sheen which is really such a nice scenario at the TV anytime you are playing that. It comes with your dreaming about and also POV and I was going to have some minions pick up and be a little bad there too the text defines a Sunday. Can't find that one now Andrea gave them away as well as well and was completely would not midline fight not a problem at all 140f for men mid therefore flyquest we didn't the FBI make that room so they had the extra member show up and were able to get that kill ignore barely surviving and now can look through actually threatened again hear a Serta love even gets back to bought Lane to pick up the wait so he really didn't lose much of anything maybe a minion on an initial Push by Turtles give me really happy about that room and these last couple minutes here despite a really poor start is black with again battling back and showing their Superior landing and in the soul you put on right now you looking at another but I find a way in a few weeks until it will be covering things up and go grab first rake the first time of the series that is something on the board for them to go to Guardians win this is starting out like what it really is this is by far their best start that they have had you know looking pretty good I need early minutes driving dragon going to be nice and we will see how long does stair going forward again solo officer and put the early Tabby to unfairly offensively makes a lot of sense when you are up against not only the GP but also the pantheon who can come in there that's going to make things you do more difficult for them to be able to afford taking him down but at the same time anytime you're expecting too much Armour there's a possibility of swapping things over and putting POV in that side lane again sponsor maybe they can answer that already well chicken clamp cleared out closer is a couple of cancer has also managed to gain a little more than his opponent has easy first blood level one closer playing defensively in his no-hitter defend against then he should be fine just to get rid of that vision and keep the farm going but it was location of trade flows back and forth solo knows that Olaf is somewhat nearby and may have to be respectful of that think that wants to do is Stand Out The Wave enough so that it doesn't just straight-up crash on his without killing so many minions that is going to push away from because keeping the wave right about where it is now is pretty much as safe as you can be on GP means that Olaf really has no option acceptable on committee for a dive Style gang and hear your ear not going to really be in much danger so it kind of a concert and it's awkward situation the guy looking right at the mid lane as it is a Farley for power people ignore lurking around as well location relatively known dog sound effects to know that someone is stealth nearby outside who he is too much of a little bit look for something else to do and no olvida steel just yet it's almost back to school that's a ward it back and close out this midlane goldenglue and the Restless as they are pushed in the Midway over there once again going for a first hail to CrossFit which all the games so far Golden Gardens bathhouse. Every single for sale people get one trip late for 3 people deny it but you was down here as well and probably get plate number to and if the Harold doesn't get more than two flight how much can you get out of it sometimes you get a kill into a Harold and then you not only get a pulsar it but eventually it will get a charge on a second. And then things could become really good looks like it has already gotten the outside if a lot of farm denied pending Hornet looking to take away this blue buff in the meantime but golden Guardians are moving back towards this bottom side and they're going to be a little bit careful about this working their way over here to the Port Colden blue alright almost of third plate thinking about us out of no one defense this it's missing one more wave to cash in on that third plate will see while to play defense
play into this a lot of people are predicting EG but there's no guarantees do you know we've seen so many upsets throughout the season and honestly I don't think that any team is so far above another besides cloud nine right when you take them out of the equation a most of the rest of the league was very comparable as far as strength eegee's getting a lot better towards the tail end of the split but I'll be really interesting to see if I can figure something out for this Best Buy because best of 5 truly is a different Beast then best of one that they can get picked in advantages if they have something figured out that try to shut down to do K then hey it can be completely different ballgameit was cool as well as your teams with the new playoff format for the Springfield of 20/20 lies if you lose hear you fart lower bracket you can have the chance to fight through there if you win you probably facing them down light of the first one doesn't quite work though obviously kudos for the pot for placement to have a a Deep Run available but also in the best-of-five teams that if they get a chance to adapt to play out to self and keep the Run going so going to be really interesting not see a ribbon Banner as if I could pick that we can't wait to see if you would pick up for himself right now this Tavares and looks like at the walk in there to play a truck the cops I will be locked in. But we haven't actually more set flexes lately it has been showing up sometimes as a support is sometimes as a jungler Champions Squaredue to the fact that it really do struggle into a lot of fart DC yeah I definitely important there right now we've got some more going on as there is a course just going to be like this that is a flexing list of likes Too Faced Mala champions of the top slide once you can fight away generally speaking is going to be able to kite out of Sabian B8 Rock take things like that so I can look really good I might very well see that's best for that said jungle and it could even be there right like that could actually be the following is a strong combo it does allow said to play very aggressively to use his abilities to go forward with kind of the safety net of once he gets very low after uses Haymaker and in that Shield expired I can pull you back out and somewhat reset the fight this is a combo life unit number of times and I'm I'm very interested from the CD draft because I do think I had a lot of flexibility could just be standard rolls you know. Bought your set-top of this could be set for this could be cool if the top is a lot of flexibility they have here going forward where is like what's drafty with pretty cut-and-dry you kind of feel like you know where everything is going to be going expecting a chocks to be top expecting Pantheon to be in that jungle there's a slight possibility of it going there but it doesn't feel like a power of evil type Champion so I'm not really expecting that to be the case yep our people is the highest damage from the mid laner in the league and if not by playing Chivas campeon it's the victor of the Oriana the Zoe and they're going to be coming through and honestly just keeps throwing out support bands cuz they've got a strong one for themselves already in the sets again doesn't have to be there not likely but I mean can happen but yeah wait to see what I see is going to come through so I can support you need at the Port they most likely need a bit later you sing them drop with lectin which means that they just listen might be bought Lane in ticket to pick to say in a Ray Liotta actually quite a lot I am expecting that they think Top Line has not been picked that they are thinking ciclista is the bot Lane and the Top Lane remains to be chosen Kathy Van coming through a couple bands have been thrown the way of the zoo k a couple bands have been thrown the way of power of evil now here to do with the Casio and the sintra to a lot of these mid laner. take off table rise door bands that are really big pick their a40g flyquest obviously Victor is available if they want to go for something relatively high damage but it does look like before can be locked into everything pretty standard size of Blacklist they will be saving middle encounter Pick 4 last trying to get power of evil at advantageous match up against Suzuki as we all know it's going to be so important to shut this guy down because he has been very very dominant in the last couple weeks F-16 four-and-twenty across this year of the first 15 minutes probably not getting shut down early on but if it does that's going to be really here going to be locked in as the real support those that will indeed be in the Top Line electric Monell's fancy going on like this again don't expect that that a question is is it going to be closed down there I think I passed to do but I'll see what you've played so much of in the last month drive is locked in for Jitsu kids going to feel real to them like was could just go with something like Victor if there's going towards the more standard Stylo pics Oriana is traditionally considered fairly good matchup interide also I am really interested to see what life has prepared though is it going to be something special deals here and other fairly standard pick your someone that does out razor ride the can actually look do push him in in the early levels to try to scale alongside him but not the one that really does matter turn the side lamp later on so not any sort of spicy, Victor has been prepared the rise was pretty easy to foresee based on how the draft have been played out of it does give EG again that comfort for UK and while he may not have party in Midland early on he is going to be the strongest Island camping in the game Uno come 20-30 minutes later on he's got to worry about Pantheon do it again and that maybe have the wrinkle that like wet pass to try to shut him down that it's not just a one-v-one did you have to worry about against Viper it's at to be one with Center adult again and trying to really shut him down well the new shaping coming out of the draft for flakowitz is the azir it's his age played all-time midliner so I think so does have them for him on that camping across his career by comparison 70 Oriana games there is a difference but a backline team fight Mage with room for playmaking with the srimad shuffle can definitely work out fine for him should be very exciting to watch as that plays out ultimately this game is about ready to go it's going to be very exciting I can't wait to see who's going to take down game 1 in this best-of-five to see you soon welcome back to the game playoff have begun here in the LCS and it is Evil Geniuses in the blue side flyquest on the red easy as top seed get side selection and they could not be chosen by Cloud Nine thinking of that Squad scene on could shoes if they want to play flag was first round it said no give that one away the team that scene was more afraid of here was flyquest and they are no Evil Geniuses opponents let us have been locked in and discuss the Bible answer man who moves on to the second round the upper bracket and I'm really excited for it Eric coming out here alongside the coolest of is the combo we have seen showing off a couple times it is very very strong you can can have some really nice interactions with that Tarik ultimate allowing as we sought you out Flay you know while ago we seen another Martinez play it so you can kind of have this Terror go in fairlea aggressively and then as he gets low he gets pulled out in that Calista ultimate straight into a terrible to be coming out after that so you can kind of time that out so you have a long kind of string of immunity obviously it also allows you to throw in the Tarik aggressively giving him some more consistent engage options to have that Knock Out Of The Knockout brother time straight into a Dazzle sun which does for the increase the reliability of that cuz it can be fairly difficult otherwise to against the Moore mobile champion definitely can be so we'll see if those targets can line up well but as you mentioned that's a really good really really really good length energy I deftly luckless to tarek a lot for a kind of all the reasons you mentioned and just yeah it's you have a wonderful day pushed in the very lightly in the Midland start this one out as a Viper surprise is starting here in the series he's not pulling the Rhythm band Squad doesn't seem to matter really do here is like no he's to be better for the team sadistically and faith in the eye test IQ. Solo was the better fit but that is a situation of like to put themselves in to take it to be the better choice and help me find their prerogative the album some of the players better than I do from the beginning that I've seen it got all those weeks and months of Screams to look at for data because it's not a visual thing is communication right and in that goes beyond just communicating what's going on your land sometimes it's positivity and, sometimes it's someone who has good ideas of place to make when you're behind door intangibles that you know it's kind of hard as a spectator to really know about or understand a Santorum though moving around here on Zouk a potentially was looking for thing for just a Raptors today but not going to be available in the topside won't be too much fun for Viper in those early level set really does bully out the heat rocks any kind of extended malate I pray that you are taking is going to be going fairly heavily in your favor couples beers can Mendes have the reason for the time to rent out so no extra damage dealt to wild turtle there but really push going into the flyquest sideboard drop-down zombie comes out after it's been staring to keep clearing right now he's going to be about a camp ahead is the two jugglers trade scuttles back and forth on the other side of the map so nothing to it doesn't happen in the early game quiz recall thumbs down for the rise for a quick tear to buy that as soon as possible to fast you can stop at the more damn you get pretty nights it is really nice and honestly getting that the archangels stacked up and having that if Shield as an additional defensive Summoner really does make an enormous difference for some of these kind of need to range type Mages such as we rise you because you are exposing yourself to taking a lot of damage to be able to be in position of being raised to deal lot of damage it really is invaluable and completely can change the types of fights are able to take so getting that stack up and ready to go as early as possible is really big and that's why I think it was just a smart move Force been scaring to move towards midlane help him push that out so they can get the recall without actually having to commit atella for it and now he's going to be in a pretty comfortable position here against our people who hasn't been able to get a base off yet if you can block power of Evil under his Tower you can perhaps Force out of TP and then create an advantage and just threw that that could be really big deal especially yeah if you can bet every able to withstand the start of this is Lane pressure and still has some of them an approval to give us till seven soldiers and fight for land controlled by which Kazuki take an extra car then again starting without this wave is crashing in the mid lane. It'll kill the ward first was going to be a little bit slow and crashing it but there should be some forms okay mrs. I see which of the ambient gold and made a CD back to Lane with an extra sapphire crystal and Sebastian Potion do you have a good way to burn flash flood comes through the Wilds of the bottling works out great really well done there by Viper finding the opportunity for that early TP play jazz UK had just use his back to Midland so they knew that was on cooldown Rise was not going to be able to respond and cool had not yet Beastie was in a great spot to do it but I sent or incomes in ignore going forward Viper does arrive Brom had gotten out of a sack down allowing them to proc that Braum's done and turtle the one to pick up that first Blood best person there to grab it so fly quest to be feeling really good it does cost quite a bit actually in the long run on the top side though because been scared is coming to actually proxy him out into a simplest and in between the turrets is on him off that way so not only is he losing their initials yes he's losing plates to yeah I feel like I'm almost Nutri wave and 320 gold earring for to place the first flight is 600 that that difference has made up pretty quickly keep mine to kill was on vasil not on bangs Okaloosa was able to I believe still stay around bottom Lane through the wave is needed not missed you much compared to Turtle so bored is reflecting a fairly close game overall East Molly to fly Quest I going to need to kill is a little more than that farming play it was worth it especially think it's better on verot than on satvinder even more there that's not on the scoreboard and the day flag look at their bottling control also get to go to this rate on credit to them for being able to actually pull this off whilst that was on a reset and while he wasn't actually in a position to try to confess that because then the next thing that I was going to bring up is you know yet as far as gold it goes fairly even but it could actually be detrimental to flyquest if then your top cleaner has no TP indeed you can set up for Dragon play bike with no take away that option and have now it'll kind of nullified that Advantage somewhat because Top Lane TV is not going to mean as much if there are no place to be had really are on this bottom side alrighty well right back out of map we go is the resets come through me no Rift are responding very shortly a lot of time we will see teams swept their bottom and the top side to fight for it or at least roam the work over if nothing else at the 83 sold out so I want to see you back under pressure before too terribly long black comfortable spot
do you know it's going to be a very uphill battle it sits for C vs onesie from the Locking group stage it's a team that is you know what are the favorites of the whole tournament versus early in the game yesterday right now what I want from them is is a lot of water warm with saying you like them right like malphite great easy way to engage they played malphite dragons yesterday and if it weren't for that throw out bearing honestly they they probably would have won that game yes there are planets made some mistakes and put them in that position but they went for an easy position they played towards team fight or stacking dragons simple win condition I think that is a smart way to do it I already do hundred thieves looking like they want to spread the map going towards TF I think that can be a strong answer towards teams that just want a group and do one thing it's a draft winning so lame try to split the map try to make your opponents have difficult decisions to deal with so I'm already kind of liking 100 thieves is going towards but I still don't think that should just wait Immortals from that.game plan it was seraphine with hack Rim you have Yahoo but you have already in your birth defects say that are not playing more seraphine I understand just like the Leafs meta is yet to play engage Dunham's sport roll with tank up there but is there to make an overall stronger grasp on the fan already but A lot's going back and forth quickly Lucian picked up here for pretty to be decanted Tomatoes supposed to say I mean I think we have to remember there's a possibility that Lucien could go to bot Lane Bogart working to be mid-length you know pretty much only where you can receive these days and competitive but I agree I like the style of composition I tend to agree with youpoint about the engage Sports I do think you can go Mala Jones where I do think that there are great tanks in the Top Lane right now you do not have to go with it more strict range Power farming style you know out of out of the Jungle or even out of the top lamp Lane Cruisers and then Fighters and what not you can just go malphite as we saw them do yesterday and are getting banned out here I think Volver we called in an LLC before brought that out in a law said leave it like that can work you know there are different approaches you're even or and I'm totally fine with a but of course it is scary when you're so phony you're going up again someday on a dominant pick up early, vote is very very powerful I don't think it's quite as good as this moment Thalia but it is still incredibly threatening is not a strong early jungler so you already know your jugular is not going to have priority you already expect going to be invading potluck having pressure so I could understand if a mortal who don't want to go through just like an automatic lose Lanes I'll talk later but I still think that might beyour best chance kind of seed d'Alene try to withstand the onslaught in the early game and then make something happen later on because if you go to like a carry hear that supposed to be a good match up well with the sound of One V one true all right leg is very very strong therapy Leona he's a really good like you got a ton of CPU. Got pretty good damage overall but I would not find it a t care with some self-heal you're really not Eataly getting away for FBI physical like gin or Ash like this killshot going to land on you and it's going to be really tough I would not mind something like aziah even a stiffer could kind of work with belt and whatnot because I work on going to come through this gives them more direct with fresh off the table and then being taken away rentals gone do you know there's a kind of dance is there is going to be here for Mortals we did seestandings this week but who knows what year did play it today and feel like he was really that much of a part of the game to be honest with you, but it was in there this is like the most 139 Lucian carp ever really think so I think it's karma top is my assumption that will be so just kind of deal with the Renekton I think that we are going to see the moon staff build from the karma top just go straight up full on team fight this is the most group and fight South composition pretty much ever no one wants to split Bush no one wants to be in the side lane it's double enchanter it's go button with the Leona go button with the acronym and ever will buffing up Lucian who has got to have a good game now pretty much be strong to be Amplified by these men who is Jane Curtin really kind of make it worthwhile guess you could be popping up potluck there too but it is low on damaged if either potluck were pretty have a bad game so there early game is important on the other side we have 131 we have early gamedominance with the jungler and we have to your point a great Marksman for absorbing that engaged for a real thing when the heck are elfs into immune that fear to avoid that for your vehicle pulled through and obviously they have some good go buttons to so they're going to try to be splitting the map but I like what Immortals drafted here I think it's super smart given that the mismatch as far as team skill you have a way to went very clearly hear a little bit much on the red side I I'm a sucker for Underdog victories and so like that it is what it is like really want see if it can work I got to do things differently Goods to bring up top bun up in the in the toppling over here with the car again this guy who actually has played a lot of August 3rd, game of pro play the only had a few years to play all down to the opl so excited to help things work wellwe saw some day play record against Quinn miles and it looked easy for him he went down a Tish CVS and then every day became a kill and then he was waiting for us the game and Niles was useless on the Quin Karma has a better fall back part of the window so even if we had the same situation of someday Lane Kingdom and clothes are showing up with this at least a fallback pattern for a top bun but yes hundred thieves are an outstanding team they're the best top later in the entire league they have a bit later and the very best of the entire thing as well I have a really good but I knowit's a meme where you're like Sunday think closer to you over a good hundred thieves are outstanding team they come in as favorite think of it expected to they've got their players as well and I want to see even going to be that back-to-back 25-minute when's the people think coming in or from Mortals really Immortals Academy to own Academy sure could surprise us and make us closer to be a banger I'm excited for it we've got some some great casters and free Buffalo game now so it's not going to amount to anything but I like these types of Blake Bortles is just doing it for man stack over by the Red Bluff expected in invades their we do see that the level 1 W on work on you can use this to go over and then we are trying to hope forwhere is you're actually catching someone camping out at the blue buff right and I think those types of invades are worthwhile you mix those in and it changes up how your phone is have to respond how your phone is have to consider what you could be doing at level one in this game nothing does really happened but the very least they do get award over by that blue bus will be able to track him a little bit when you guys come down to the Lord that bottom side back room is going to be starting leashless on his red eye where is Natalie who already has the much faster clear is going to get a lie so this is going to kind of slingshot clothes are quite a bit ahead of the potluck already and I want to see if he can get anything done on this first clear if you can try to steal away some pants if you want to try to invade early toward that blue but perhaps they have a ward thereI like the t's crossed and I's dotted by Mortals here at the early game potluck drops his Ward down early on a photo with Red Bluff right as 1:30 comes around Joey drops went down as well to make sure he's not doing red to blue red to invade should say unit 3 and bottom side to be available if there is a skirmish down there I mean Leon a record is very volatile xayah and therapy and don't have a states are we out of the game pretty constant is okay we know what happened we see link chickens we know closures Pathak was a full clear bottom side a by the way top who in this being so close to going to be up there in about 20 seconds get ready for that potluck to be smart things by the flu and drop the same time but they still far right now play Immortals meu expecting they are professional players here but right now it's hey be careful because as soon as I can be a big fight and we'll have to see how toHunan just wait right because he did bounce the first wave now ideally I think he just wants to let the wave no push against them and then perhaps if the big back way before you protected on the dive but you need this way it's actually come out and somebody has a frozen at that pretty much the perfect spot because I was in the spot where he wants to get it fully reset but it's kind of stuff in the position and it could be a pretty rough play WoW pretty important to a flash gold card would never do anything you would just cleanse perfectly and still get away so there's no real need any way to stop him get too late for the first game for the game still a full six Camp clear from Italy Top Gun available taken as Politics the bottom side and do you know the first few games do not come through but we are sitting in the hundred thievesabout the map at the very least they reset the wave and they can actually Zone to Huong off some of this you can see that he's missing out on all that experience you have engagements Bottoms Up Rico's back for a Joey and realistically so much durability because of the power of Guardian work on G+ powerless Chuck just don't do a whole lot at top right now but maybe you can keep this Lane in a spot where someday we'll get the night it's going to go to the turret. But I guess I'm going to have a tank that wave in front door to hold you going to keep the farm going and if you know the jungler could be up there it's always risky because you know at that point someday as half-elf can you can't break them down as a, even if you just get send up by Renekton and Spirit by Majid Ali and nothing else happens besides that that's a big chunk on your help right after you TP backed up saloon alreadybehind off of that initial play and he did miss out on something experience as a wave crashing now the wave is again pushing away from him this is you know he's involved back pattern as you were talking about how pretty is grass, he is going to your first we'll see exactly where he does go after that but for now and you want to be staying ahead in in the enchanter vs. melee matchups because they can get to the point it when they get some sustained on someone like this Renekton where they're just sustaining through all your damaged or ignoring everything you're doing and then they have full control of him Lane and their name is getting power Q Sunday still by head over all you can see CS equal but you got an extra 7cs to take in front of him so we are suspecting step today to win this Sunday he's going to win Paisley every lane I can't wait to see the El Faro game is on the line that's going to be a fun but I think in the future but we've got closer so incredibly active looking for athe closer season this is why it would happen to the top of the table is that was perfect a double knockout from who he as soon as that didn't get flash it just felt like a mortal's was accepting their death I think the call was there's no way we can actually get out of this heat of Muses he'll neither of them use their flash they accept their defeat but it is the devil kill going over to closer it separately ultimate highly effective here from Devante this was just perfectly done as a Carrera love into the corner here keeping Joey stacking up as they try to retreat and who he find that point blank double knock up the gold car was already there a tank of the tower they realize they can read I've but they reset the aggro first of the month I can have it on him a train not going to have any risk of getting killed off there in the re dive and that was justWallace from hundred thieves have a bot Lane worth playing to Ward then they're doing is perfection really beautiful stop snow 1600 top late is already winning bottling certainly going to be winning now and hang clothes I got to kill so that his pockets he's going to be bigger than potluck going to win model who plays going to be available Keith is farming a CS is okay and and one thing I will say that is positive is divided the back of the double kill went in Italy 6 so his experience is not really been set back whatsoever closer hasn't really done any counter jungling eBay do something now but potluck has just been comfortably farming and the early game for hecarim is pretty garbage you do in a lot of games that broke Leo C hack Rim in this type of match up really kind of help back having that little sick delay the fog has gotten there he's not going to win the scrimmage as you saidin time he'll have the ultimate online if you have double enchanters behind him and there is potential still for him to be very very effective but you know Mortals are going to have to be able to even find those two fights because phytochemicals pick it up there could be about that and give the ghost is Popeye potluck but there's not going to be a battle so he's going to stay alive but we're going to lose some of your throat as you walked
do the Met game they've been playing very well they got themselves to an advantage of a overextended trying to get back there and they felt like they have a small Edge that they could use the Volvo old game open and ended up blowing it open but the other way they ended up kind of throwing the game off of that unfortunately I do think though for flyquest it shouldn't be all Panic right they made a mistake largely the game end on that one error on that one decision so I think like what if they can stabilize if they can calm themselves coming to this game they fill could have three kids.all right we are under this window chords Blackfoot last game won new playoff format also some slightly new site selection rule by seed ticks game 1 in the loser of the previous game gets fixed sights looking for the next up examples for Game 3 new change for this year going to happen rope light as wellreally well on the cliff the last game and it was kind of a dominant carry Force around that Baron fight in El Cajon that climactic final device thing was huge take that away but we also got to know that with easy on Red dyed blue but you're okay and that can be very dangerous for player here this is a guy who can look of you in the draft but it will be an early step pick here for Aflac west of spelling it out supposed to be locked in for EG so if it is just have a standard top-liner for Viper or if he's going to be looking to do anything flexible if they're going to look into that said around whatsoevereasy trying to set up a top link pin try play band the HR to the very end to say hey if if we get set you don't have to come. Be there for the match up so which one you want to go for if it was still very highly prized in Pro play kind of worldwide flight to go for the Messiah in 3 o clock to Brookline give Brayden gazlay of absolute wonderful back light damage output as well so I like to feel a lot more in top 400 yes it can be flexed we saw it earlier today in LA CA midlane but I am expecting this to be the top leader Kumo should be fairly comfortable into the set it is a diss advantageous match up but like most melee matchups orange and farm to find one doble bedroom King set fight very very favorably into the orne in that won't be one scenario but it's orange. The kind of stiff back of the door that try to farm it out and prepare for the future fightyou've already set yourself up with very consistent very reliable and gauge between Nautilus and foreign on the other side yes it is very explosive engage coming out from the rakan voriconazole in there if you get locked down but then you can get turn around on and burst out yes I should be a surprise. What has every single person on EEG has at least a route so far in there kitten going to get dropped the van tables band way here so I suppose to get rid of Zoe on the NCG here in the second round of band that you mention to counterfeit case available in Beauty and play all kinds of exciting spicy things I know you're talking about Echo into Cinder as an option but of course u d r chain bag messenger you seeing Olaf and trundle now join the band blue make you wonder if you're going to see a third tank picked up here is BG might distract until this is why I think this Jungle Band is really smart here especially when there's already worn in Nautilus bathroom with the ultimate struggle be an obvious jungle pick the Air Force and Torrence even if they don't want to take that away by The Fixx to weaken for Nancy buddies days makes a lot of sense is going to give him a bit of a p damage as well as more powerful engaged and really there is so many go buttons now I do think that we're going have to see a high consistent damage style mid laner though coming out of EG to go alongside this is right now there is some burst from the stream and Squad would mostly it is on a failure to get back into some damage done in Black was here if they are going to go with that is a lock in there are a number of Austin's here that we could see Victor can work if you want to go to go to the side lane later on it and play that type of style you can Farm out against he is here and also you are a high DPS style of made in that later stages do you think that then you run the risk of not having enough damage kung fu fight time Galley was here than Oriana's the first part of in meditating fight Mage has the consistent damage out for this way down the list well they're hovering on to Anna's real real men flexibility let's go as this is actually really really expecting you to just be a Navy style bills which does make your ear damage profile clearly one-dimensional yet there is some bad things going through four brackets and what not but there's not so many things are going to be an issue it's possible it could be a p i can't say I've seen a really long time for playoffs is physically to three years ago something like that so really actually how well you know play this out obviously there is the ability to try to actually trade from range and some poke away at the beer if he is your uses his to forward you can shift in past those soldiers and look for an aggressive trade back on the power of evil so probably was really going to have to be careful about how he uses his cooldowns in this matchup what is UK's on conqueror so I'm expecting a dies irae I double check there is there are no lifetime games for free very first and you said hey what kind of guy have a very large well first time in Pro as real men comes through Brooks are we have seen things like Cannon go doran's blade into AP later but really exciting AZ asriel here and I'm really excited to go that crazy he is going to stick with the doran's blade or tried-and-true here this is the guy I have really been seeing at all I would be interested to know either a boy oh boy by placing those are all mad and play that is making his is returning Inspira foraminal aspiring to do K yep absolutely like it's fun like her home so I can look up like okay you know what like what are some good like that's like a cross to carry playing it as an 80 carries so hey I want to see if it's good good luck on you this is not a dedicated split push with away from the champion is not phenomenal it is team fight damage I put in poke also knows put EG fairly physical heavy no Azrael is a bit mixed overall he's choking 30% is Magic from the w e and are all being reasonably medical source of damage output but it really does Venus enter on the eggs are ya I mean you're going to see a lot of Tabby's on of a number of these members you know you can see full tank with armor stat consent or you can see easily things like yeah first the tool that's the big thing right as you need it back up before the third man the begin dies with level two. Means that much damage the follow-through is not super huge but it is still a couple hundred damaged out that it forces the potion of wild turtle I think that's the thing they are getting that potion out but you can easily do things like Bramble and tapis and then go into more core items those types of builds work very very well so I'm going to be interested to see if it does for that out or if I pursue going to want to build more for that when he won because if he is going to leave the room King set that Tyson field still if you show up to team fight against double Marksman you are going to be very very susceptible to getting folks down not any very rarely gives you take it the two CS lead off of the first three wave 17215 is those I'll drop down Kubo gets a knock at for the grass practice some decent damage but that's because of its Viper has the early push an organism edit image of a champion and honestly because of his percent Health damage scaling can threaten Champion sometimes so maybe viperwolf quite to be allowed to armor stack I'm not sure I don't work trades but it would certainly have the match up and do it might not be great for the overall game save a lot to do with him a choice he makes there as a fight towards the top sides lights at someone walks away getting almost nothing from the kids probably 10 HP or less it was so is my available that's pretty annoying since Karen slides in does it take that away and we'll be able to retreat to his card so I can farm that up we can go Bora convert RADS in these types of things in and near Triforce and just try to go purely for that but if he wants to act like a suit of tank you can go the more kind of Tanki bills with them early armor and therapist in these things and just try to beef up to allow freedom for power of evil and wildturtle to it to get Damage Done It seems like it's because there's a lot of damage already between the has ear and the desire and it's also fix damaged profile right you have pretty much pure Magic from the is here pretty much for your physical from the bios so things can't be looking very nice as far as that does go also got to keep in mind how did the engages for the squad by j4 Plus work on very solid engage and even stronger engage honestly over on the side of EG between foreign gragas and Nautilus you can pretty much start a fight whenever you want what's the gauge then yeah I know it can be annoying to have to be the first in cages orbit is follow-up he's absolutely phenomenal and you got a crack is a nautilus to make that happen so does look like a Bee Gees Compton definitely execute pretty well fighting over the top side right now as Viper sleep and actually it was healthy enough it looks like with just enough here soon as Bramble vest and should be able to waive clear but I got off that fight it was a bit of a silly trade to be honest maybe he's trying to threaten the haze VIP are you know I'm fighting aggressively got to watch out type thing but taking those those trades it's so easy for set to win out on you know as long as he's able to actually get a decent Haymaker off its almost is never going to go in your favour you pretty much have to take a quick trade where you brought the brutal and then immediately run away because any sort of extended trade will just go more and more in favor of the set when you're playing or I was going to plan something pretty important here bang had to take a really unfortunate recall we talked last week about you really want to have you no. 4 tsps it's at 5 minutes and change the United vs word recall he was forced back though lost the entire wave under his turret wild Bank only gets the pickaxe there and they're going to come back when people see s but the 15 more should meet the mind control for the does I ever caught feeling really good for them you're having a better recall is Central and it's been staring at each other here is also have the ultimate to join in if there's any sort of gang that happens in that bottom lane or any type of fights like that so something you'll have to watch out for a little bit is that kind of global presence of the astral so to speak but if there's none for 4 seconds maybe a bit more damage of the top that can that can help find you something to watch for Central against the second red bumps Pond without much issue and wait to see if the Drake and again I'm expecting flight was to have control over bottom Lane recalls heel boots for something I realistically but you know he's doing the Infiniti supposed to feel good about that so like it does close the gap some what is still have to claim control should be able to shove in Bop and realistically isn't a few seconds then but there's going to be on the map and we can be there for it so that's that's going to be the response right just make the move earlier by as much as you can to be as strong as you can but yeah I mean if you can't get the BF early I can be pretty difficult actually save up to Ward's is very very expensive item Azazel is going to help us in this is less about the gang Kenmore just about resetting that way so they can actually move up and start this Rift Herald TP they have their top cleaner to mow down to the bottom Lane where he can actually be pushing out this wave and a fight breaks out he can still join with PP so if you do want to play this little bit slow Force flag make a move because Kubo is already in it a good position I would not see likes to Kumo just push it in another wave and 4 CG to be getting an event
in-store see if that can throw any sort of a curve ball into the series and do they have anything up his fig leaf plant here for still loaf or is it more of a we're losing we got to try something we got to make something up I hope for flyquest sake that they do have a bit of a plan with so low that isn't just kind of desperation hear these EG has been looking like the stronger team and is in full control and I want to see flight West Cary through toppling over half the games played which is absorbed through a toppling things to know what they find Kilz early level one up there at set set it at that one's down to stay on Rockbridge picks at last time in the early stages of game you know if I predict at Como very low but you was building for this before style of a gameplay and the game wasn't about to go but she was about team fighting so does solo even go for that file a builder to build more for the 585 that's going to be something interesting also worth noting that Greg has now take off the table spent here and has been incredible on this Champion near really really dominant turned it in great game last game I believe you who played in game one so that is going to be something different since he ran obviously has more than just the gragas could look towards something like lease in which is one of his big go to you know as the 4th pick in the draft that gets left up again EG protecting their orange by Banning out trundle this painkiller that can come out from the jungle and we have a very similar draft overall in the first three picks are the same and differences as far as the bands to go and I'm really interested you know if life was his down to run it back does he just go to HBO again and say all right yeah I mean it's really a possibility right so I've been looking at this back to back to the pantheon was band instead of Olaf so you know what couple of small things different as far as that's concerned here looking at the Zoe theft again. The same as last time and they think they're waiting to find pics down at least I like to see what else we afraid of police in indepthly a signature pics for him will Champions what's third I think he's going to maybe go driving you know that the possibility if you just want more AP you could look for something like at least so stacked going to be another tank so this is interesting I do feel like without even the Greg is jungle you would be perhaps more hesitant to go to the Azrael for for this kind of heavy physical damage team assuming all the other picture of the same on the other side cuz it's Jarvis is here and fly the exact same Compass last week right policy will be different juggler for EG but I would be curious to see are they willing to go to Ward's that same pic knowing you don't even have that the magical damage threat coming out of the jungle I'm not sure honestly I never saw the last of the Jungle Sammy., where's the way to find out do they go to this again is a fairly large difference here you do have much less magical damage you know all on the same yes I'd wanted us some Ashley McBride it is just lock it almost mirror dress the only change out of the ten Champions is sincere and scratches himself out for sage want to hear so blacklisted very clearly thinking cough was not an issue it was play we can execute better on this we're bringing in Seoul he may go different field maybe a little more armor heavy or the game even add level-three you can before Gangsta play me you're going to pass going to play around for 6:20 really is kind of farm it to 6 it's it's rare that you're looking for these types of skirmishes early on especially if you don't have a lane dominant melee Championship are alongside it right it's not like you're going to go up there with your said wani Orin combo and looks you knock down this set that's very unlikely to be the type of play if you strip a rally ask for the set yourself or you know something a bit more kind of dominant and maybe you played hours at Renekton is another good example as real not going to be where you're going to live to fight early so I do think since Aaron is going to come and have the job of sitting back and farming up and maybe like I said just hoping that that allows them to dictate the pace of the game better yeah it may well I mean it's going to be listen to watch Forrest is Ronnie is a 55-45 physical damage champion soon right she's not the greatest of course of course right further as well as even if she is 55 physical work prints on their team about tenacity van armor that is debatable the right choice I'm not you know to tell them for sure what they should have been doing butt end of the day I just might still be the match game his profile is even lower the crowd control profile to get higher ed we may still again see the three marked red billed which gives a lot of runaway 250b unmitigated in the damage output it's just so interesting rare that you get to watch back-to-back games from proteins with essentially all these things staying the same your some slight differences I'm not sure that her last game I can't quite recall I want to say that was different a solo is going to be starting during Shield where Viper started during blades a little bit more defensive start there it is just interesting to catch these small changes in small differences to see if that really leads us do anything different or solo himself can just make more of a a big difference now this is two games in a row that ignore has actually done the sweeper start waited till 1:30 then walked into the river directly check for that wart last game I believe he does not find it this game he does so a bit of a pattern there that he'll have to watch out for her because teams that are watching flyquest you know we'll know now this is this is one of his habits and that can be something that can get picked on if you're not careful of course he has the whole like 19 game regular season as well sit to look at but you know what it's like the same Champion even across solo replacing a Viper yeah so I expect I got my words backwards Kubo has to bring flash level one exactly do you know what I think I'm not even sure that he had to flash he was so close to his power is full of hell do you even need to blow the Summoner there I can't see how they have anywhere close to enough damage to actually believe you out after that comes a decision of how much damage will you take not will you die cuz I think there's no way you die it's just a question of do you lose too much help that maybe you lose your teleporter to lose control in the lane so with that watch the very least, does preserve his health in allows himself to to really kind of hang in there in the lane and and not be having give a farm ignore but with a table to kind of fight back a little bit yeah really wish she had the bigger help are there and so we going to get tonight straight on top of the gate c22 9 + Cs and it's not going to get better but this is going to remain a deficit and mrs. Knock up in and when you miss that knock up your kind of felt like feeling a little bit stupid as sent such as punching weight you as you are trying to run back he will be able to pick up some of that farm so he is down just about a little bit over a wave and is going to actually go for the early recall which I find a little bit surprising he's actually going to call and see if he was still fairly high in elf I'm surprised they didn't just crack some items and try to hang around because now if he gets real Yankton and you just how to teleport you're at the risk of actually losing plates of a really falling critically far behind and santorin is up here on this top side so that is a possibility yep put the control work down to fix refillable controller for the controller to the triple brush and of course Splashdown they know he's also a t t down there's no way he gets that potion and is actually in time but so you're seeing Spencer and have to do the due diligence he right he's got to Shadow top and say okay if there is a gank if there is a dive I need to be around for that one and they were going to have to knock a plan for bit of Cece and not go for too much more is you have it's going to come from Como there makes solo use the Haymaker which then pushes the way back towards in your damage but still getting punished very heavily on the back end of that trade I use going to try to clear this out and probably match recalls because he's quite low and doesn't have to pee or so looks still has his tail for Advantage now it just kind of come down to that CPS right in a Solo domestic made his earlier so now you can build a fully reset Legacy for the Damage Done Right Now is there going to be a back and forth in the bottom Lane is 520 this is the way if you want to recall him if your farm is good thing it would have taken one back and the way the Jason for banks he almost has Turtle just barely slink away no summer is left but easy going to have control over the bottom Lane that was so close to a Kill a wonderful and couldn't have stepped past ignore for that final Auto hard to know if he could have got it but that plus the fact that they actually have minion dematerializer means they killed that can't wait so fast that it actually such a critical use of that many dematerialize silly clear off this wave so that wild turtles going to lose everything he's normally would be coming back to the cannon just arriving like now and not really be losing a lot he's going to lose every single year and have the way of pushing away from him so that is such a big deal and that early game ruined really making a big difference As Nice match black Shih Tzu sacroplasty flash going to stay alive down there I and I want to see ya pay call back it get some pick axes to refill a potion he's in a great spot itemized right now and he's really going to do anything as the wave is just now crashing both been there to take their trip back up singer in the tear is on as it should. Kolin as well to vote for the power of evil who's actually already running out of Mana but I do think with the vamps have to rush it's probably going to be just building for that side lengths he doesn't have a very big advantage and I think dinner at that recall but I do think that come over I think he completely wasted as hell for it and has put himself very far behind right away 3 on 3 0-60 ignite have to walk back was there a lot of damage to my night was also burned out of Mana with a blue whale spotting but I need that desperately to fight for having a manifold at all and that's why I think there are two depending on the way over exactly I think they need to try to get some relief up on that topside prior to this potential Harold spawn if they actually want to go for that, does need some healthy is down 20 CS has some to actually pick up there we'll see if he can stabilize has so far so has been looking really good in that one the one bowling Kumo pretty heavily booked top leaders do not have TP don't you be available actually on either side for now and Russillo checking that last night making sure it is safe to move in they are going to be starting up the thrift are all but is spotted at least buy a g but I'm not sure I don't know if I will have to again to be respectful this one since there's a spot that Harold's being attacked not get away in this is Prince at work still affect the blue bus and he gets Rift Herald and he gets first Blood he should have played the entire series but at least he's here now flag with 700 golden The Herald play great but that is actually like that is reportable I have no idea what's been scaring is doing that was a no brain play from since guarantee he's going to die 2 is back in base walking out there like what do you do you know what what are you actually thinking you're going to accomplish there and it just seems crazy that he even walked over and then not only that but he flashes into the wall wasted summer also and that just do it hangs around knowing that they're coming up from River has no mana and Ice to controlling the opponent's he's got so there's like I can't let him get Harold and knock them chopped Erick he will never forgive me for that level one game where he had to burn flash so we got it we just got it we got to show up
substitution of solo had really shaken things up so easy now having lost that last game the biggest I selected they will be on blue side for the day and we'll see if that has any difference here and it is left up is easy willing to actually for a pic that you know is a high enough priority because that's far it's been a lot of set first pickread it has been a lot of that one will see if Elias changes things around of course as well that's awesome right I think that is a A+ there for DG as well keep that has been up as well and I think like us are running out of bands in this series I think they're never going to leave us or the block to Seneca is but I don't give you a priority early-game up on the top side of the response you're going to be a truck so this is a run back I believe from game one for we did see that step vs. aatrox down matchup obviously so low now in therethat does change things up but you know I haven't always been the most effective in the LCS but it does give you pressure up on the top side and it's also if your top laners not your strongest member it's one of those carry salt is going to allow you to kind of go even if and have an impact right they almost never play up around that why they have mono a lot of these cells is that can exceed well on their own and then they can focus on Tuesday they can focus on prep the bot Lane and these types of things do it again so loved here because if he can maintain an even or better laying against solo I think things are going to be looking pretty good for EG and this pic ban memes that they're going to get right they're going to have the ability now if you have been so successful in that first game and also the takeaway of Pantheon makes me wonderremember rise was largely shut down by Santo and having Pantheon and being able to join alongside the atrox for those chemical play with their side it opens up much more of an ability for EG to be the one game that side of a priority and playing through that and that's something that is okay really does excel at so I'm anxious to see if this is kind of tipping their hand so to speak and and indicating hey we want to go to the side lengths we want the Vintage that may be so I wouldn't be surprised to see a rise been over all specially with you know is your job as well you kind of give it would imagine he cares about on Florence a Torrance at 4 and set I mean qq's to me more their loss condition one thing we saw all right if the game is arguably needlessly at level one leaning top cleaner in the LCS the stats back that up there is a difference challenge Wiki and so now to get to the second I think four games in a row a second-round Zoe been away from duke a pic for p16 be at least kind of read it right and I felt like he was healthy enough that he could have actually stayed around and said he'd tee-peed right back into way that was already being questioned so you ended up getting jumped out even more behind the TV back. Logan that have the base without TV and lose Lochte more minutes and out even working me with that band cast into the rise so I think I did have it right I do think EG is going to go for a ride here try to play this island have Google withstand that smashed up early again solo then start to Group San jezu k out on play Four Rise alongside the pantheon from spin but they still have to lock it in for me to be correct so we will find out they need meds they need support so very interesting so it is so great about the side lamp play but now it's about Bali it's actually about crashing towards Botley utilizing the gate for the pantheon from the neighbor Man 3 scene where everything is going to be put you is it going to be set before is it going to be orange support is it going to be you know that both be swapped between jungle in it write a note play champion champion sorry is is Tulia all the time so if there's a delay it expects to be for Corky here at the mattress of Pee Wee is again on a fairly safe backline consistent damage dealer down there I'd like closest it as a do-over a lot of same reasons I like Kalisto with tarek is did you have a hard to access team fight crowd control that you can then throw him into guarantee knock up walk behind them facebreaker if you go for the old as a quick workout you and come back and there's a lot of safety here I can work really really nicely for extra spice it's going to be on the stone on the set which I'm really happy about we got dark Harvest August do not support that I feel like is a little bit questionable I'm going to reserve judgment and see if he can kind of make me feel it feels differently but I just feel like when you are playing support Aftershock is very important for creating the tankiness in the early levels where you don't actually have all of the bonus stats from the additional goal that you would get in a Solo Lane your lower levels and you would be from the filling do are inherently Sheeran and therefore are usually more depending on things like this don't play in the early Aftershock just try to make things happen on me stoneboat can be very useful as far as laning it's also coated now to two more often give you things like Predator when you are basing so you can Predator back out of the map look for Rome's and into those sorts of things so I will be very interesting and as he said of the dark Harvest also pretty cool coming out from the zoo queso I want to see if they can actually find anyting in a with that if they can you stack it up enough that it really makes a difference the upside is basically you get to trigger Aftershock and then get a new Keystone mid fights the keystones mmt do yes that is a downside right is that like well it's conqueror 4 Azazel so we can facebreaker you and deal 25 more damage with it which okay not Darvish butter supposed to be pretty bad dark Harvest of us will help me pretty bad but at level 5 and kill someone also worth noting I was talking of the tendency of ignore these last two games how he was actually sitting in that side brush and at 1:30 he was actually going forward to then sweep out a pixel brush this game easy actually had a three-man play waiting for that time and actually checked for ignoring that side brush but he had already base so already EEG very clear that their coaches were paying attention and notice this kind of thread that I've been pointing at last game tried to make their own level one adjustment do to stop it will my God flashing in level 1 help are dropped off both these guys as well I don't hate burning flash for half of you tell part you think of oceans yes now it means Basil's an easy target free 6lack wife will come back well before he ever get I wonder as old as heck deck Clash this is what the inspiration set of the tree was supposed to do was cool creative rule-breaking I'm in love with what kind of service laning phase II owners in those days ahead Aftershock by the way he's going to be fine through all these tone is undefeated gamer right here Zanesville he is going and what a start from EG this bot Lane showing they are not to be trifled with have been smashing in the two V-22 dookie on the early level 3 ROM the 44th they're all here but it's higher level on ichiba leaders that is level 3 on level three level one on ignore level two on turtle and that makes all the difference in these early level is the Difference Maker 25 by the way sir for something big on this one when the lading face started ignore was sitting at the blubaugh I don't use leasing or what but she was nowhere near the lane is basil and Bangor behind the opposing cast of minions to do when I'm fertile he missed the first email eyes he was zoned out that he missed XP not just gold female is 180 XP in the lane which is absurdly massive for break Point. Lane I don't know what for signor to not being lame to screw drill that hard but that is paying for it after seeing already it could have been him looking for a university for play right where the talk about those early game play maybe he was looking for a different world they've been Place sweep that out and that was part of the game plan but this is terrifying now right you're going up against this Lane and Azazel you know it's going to keep looking for these texts flashes know he has some movement speed on summer usage Rune he's going to be able to jump in there really really quickly and clicked as one of the best snowballing Marksman in the game it is frightening to play against these Lanes from behind so charlatan are going to have to be playing really really safe which means very likely he's going to get full fire Dion these are early dragon and can start running back here they're getting zoned off the wave against 39 CS 216 this is a shellacking in the bottom Lane is a 5 1/2 EGR smurfing down here and it's just absurd house scaring baby going to be biting off more than he can chew put the shield still going to be Sunday here comes the re-engagement flashes to safety and cars at half and not interrupt me to punch come through for 1:40 call him Captain Falcon azelf like was forced to run away again but stay alive or that you're a crucially and and also didn't get any CS right so guess that was a messy fight yes I think Spencer steak out and puts his is Bali in this awkward spot but because they're so much stronger and because turtle is having a focused on fighting the Champions not the minion he's not getting any Farm throughout this and meanwhile up in the Top Lane yeah SOLO you're doing great you have an advantage here but you're playing aatrox into the orange orange can stabilize and be in a position with levels where you can safely Wayfair at your turd almost forever so you really don't even care about that side of the mat easier just going to leave come on that island and say great farming up bud and we'll be down here on the bottom side looking for poor man plays and playing around or Calista who is super fit felt right now looking at is Kubo clean press the wave and so it takes his first recall of the game it's going to be about a 14c Isley top side as the lanes reset to stay around and waving with you at first items coming through but, he's going to frisbee 57 minutes in at levels at level seven his potions get his control board and see right now the brake is alive and then Harold spawns in about 40 seconds turtle and ignore level three and four to five and five four three plates taken down and we'll be Seymour down here the points the dress itself going to drop here comes the wall and I got to stop off and gets back away just really to stay alive what's an 8-minute first person 3 kills GG time to go next Boise G pollinating this game they are running over the bot Lane holy moly they are just crushing flyquest
current form in the way he's ramped up over the split I think it's a hard argument because of his weaker 4 release date but this guy has been such a monster Solo Carry through a variety of different pics and I'm so excited to see if he's going to be able to pull that off for the team and lock in that second place probably has had a monstera split all along so I think a lot of ways this is an indirect someday vs. UK game where people are going to be counting on them too hard carry them is that second place finish both of these teams have been on absolute fire here in the second half of the split-end teams rightfully so then that they're competing here in our final game of what would be called the regular splint for second-best being in the elseheading into the postseason Evil Geniuses hundred thieves hitting the fit in the rift in just a bit we see the band tables are bands out there on the table so then I'm going to head it right back over to freaking coat for one more call thank you very much. I should Welcome to our fourth and final games day turns out Monday actual game itself that was a great intro battle for second place so there is a mismatch of both top and mid lane about it whatever who's the primary care in front of me I want to get into four Champions lights for this game is targeting those players for Evil Geniuses just think it's a really good example the last time we saw on undertale this much more scaling Champion has to get ascendancies for her to gain range gain more power to be able to function I really think that Egypt is better when they get to the Champions at you more closely associated with them to rise the livelong the echo really keep up pressure and have more of an identity being self-sufficient and not really having to rely on a set of team but you can see what comes to you right now is the Zoey is in for my always going to feel pretty comfortable going to wait to see what day is going to be expecting Cody sun to be on a pretty strong back line damage machine we know if a Leo's got grabbed where to find invite machine that is an easy way to find a blue team advances Wild n Out the trundle when you picked a sidhwani here on first-round so he just didn't want to be on the receiving end of this red coming through 14 fights zillions going to be banned out as well actually I was on that for for Target Banning it up so we're assuming yeah let me badly set up there we really really think I'd be the match of Euro to know the jungle it is for God as well he's going to wait on their bottling Pick 4 last the ortino's but they say okay what is go thrush first we'll wait for 80 carats is very bright and let's make sure we know what the rest of your comp is Hooser jungle who's your mid show it and then we'll put her care very excited now that she was going to have nothing really Branch out 4th for fear of people getting flamed if if the more unconventional fix don't work out I you get to choose from freak with a mouse for some point and click baby that's not exactly a solo type of champion is self-sufficient type of champion and it really does come from your level six of course you get to walk down the Zoe he's a lockdown someone on hundred Thieves for Evil Geniuses actually take out okay so Champions locked engine was the hover over to Calista I think is more likely pick and be like okay is it okay to just going to go back for total links game long range safety 5:35 at a Crane's above-average remarks and freaks description rage because he feels like garbage her rages so short and she relies so much on her Mobility WhatsApp Assaf Shahar olds you eat a you just feel completely useless it takes so much of the fight out of this team, I'll be over but feel so much more comfortable from the side of hundred these if they do have Cody sun on the very sore and and just get to make from his side and more safe range yeah I'm going to ask you assess tactile the same but even if you are very soon you have more range than some of that close to you still might have to burn that for 200 gold to get away from a flash from Al soultan to you know Lisa and and then a truck that has fallen through run to you so it's a battle for the second feed I don't know there are many people who thought EG and hundred thieves were going to be the team's button for a second but at the end of the day they play the games out and those are the teams performed best so congratulations them so far for a great season already second-seeded be awesome they will have to play either a rematch or flight quest in the first round of the playoffs we already know what the matches are going to look like but it's I'd Flex at the very least going to be a pain to watch for so we're going to take our five minute break for competitive Integrity will see you here with us for our last game of the day for second seed in playoffs hello everyone and welcome back to the show the last regular-season game of LCS about to begin with me Evil Geniuses and hundred thieves as they fight for the second seed in playoffs all the others might have been determined but second and third will be tossed around based on who wins this one and he's been really really hot they have a reason to this point in the standings off of Pretty lacklustre first Robin how did these are 8 and 2 since the first night game at that point so hot right now for all the marbles 6 Africa dies 31st who's actually really excited I like to see him on these types of Champions lots of Mobility lots of options that you can go for early on courses UK stop since early on males are generally trying to dissuade clear Farm up to six and Zoe's really the one that has more of those looks early on will see if Ryoma can actually continue on with his power Arc the split as the generally been getting a lot more favor yes do it better overall laning phase why is he is still the the weakest starting mid laner and turn to black gold XP difference on the other side Cuomo has that same honor up in Top Lane and a certain degree like these are not bad players but you're in the you-know-what the most penalties in the world is a lot of great players out there someone has to be 10 right and that's what sort of happening here just a primary care for EEG someday Primary Care Trident early on and and have a lead to use that that is my expectation coming to this game will see if that changes based on performance but is there an indirect to love her solo carries stunts actually going to get the nice little play Auto there with the empowered Auto to and Azazel and their starts APUSH Wars looks like really pushed going to go hunting things the way I got to say about the new season support items that can actually get Relic Shield and not miss Cannon constantly quality of life for the changes so happy with that one shot or two to land that to you they're exactly it doesn't want to take anything extra to zoo kpcr channel is corrupting potion maybe we can try and get a little bit of damage cost to tag them get the burn going but I swore swore 1245 brush Ferris here stuck going to take the opportunity actually to go really deep in the jungle for an early War to try to figure out if Spence Karen is doing the information acquired
tuina strategies come to a head I think I'm leaning a little bit more towards golden Guardians I do like the proactivity in general more than the slower wait and see what happens but I am it doesn't come down to watch the Soul Eater soup make sure they're not making mistakes that lead to death and give over early gold to the team that's probably going to have his healing advantage and they will be accelerated into their late game items are already we're getting a look at the focus is for both of these squads is a I'll give you the final word as we seats 380 carries already hitting the band table alongside of Rumble and and Horn thoughts on the way that these teams are already showcasing their approach to Champion Select and Johnson coming off of a strong game FBI has been really good over the last couple weeks can be used to see if ferrets get banned out also because that could be an early Pick 4 Golden Guardian given how much FBI has been wanting to go towards it and how successful he's been on it but we've also been seeing so much in a set a truck stop so maybe we'll get that too I'm just kind of excited to see at what they have in store for us well through the first band phase of arras was left up and it's a snap pick up for Golden Guardians as hell called it will see if the bottle and can get it done one last time golden Guardians dignitas winner is in to the playoffs and the loser now that's the end of their season until summer rolls around so with that were tossing it right back over to the Caster to gets into a third game of the day thank you. As you mentioned the winner is into playoffs as they exceed the loser is 7th and goodbye you tried very hard but it wasn't enough you can see here that the rematch also of week 7 it was who his first game on Golden Gardens is running support for the 2020s but I do like the Grinch steal away go with in the first round here because that's the most common parents with Varys that being said golden Guardians have paired with the zig zag last time around so they didn't have a lot more options than what the conventional pairings have been yeah I like the Olivia however I would go Misfortune here I think it's it's easily Johnson second most played you look at the Affiliates fans back and forth I got to go to Jamie's house for a movie file is the options but through instead they want to play something with a bit more engaged was also to be there a lot Safety Lane outrageous definitely a strong later and especially since it might be a lethality varus with a Zoe on his team that could easily be FBI building attack damage Polk and gold and blue building the AP poke for the team but also I like how the asset to the team, because they were looking for some hard engaged to have a Cairo super long-range can set up Pantheon rotations to try and pick people off in quickly turn numbers are turn gang surround so a lot of play with with all these ultimate provide a voyage and if that's on a Target that just got a sterile you can have multiple people this way dog piling and catching you out underwears I want to see if they keep asking do cool proactive things golden Guardians got a point out speaking practice though had to sub 30-minute wins to go to just this weekend they are looking really really hot right now it was against some slightly weaker opponents but you know if they can keep that pressure going it looks like two teams on a hot to break dig are on a 300 win streak Golden Gardens in a 200 wins and what better time to fight for your black lives than right now where you're playing guess you probably have all year long to Petoskey themselves a mid-length going to grab Victor they're going to leave that Pantheon that can remain flexible they're going to leave that for Less who else has also talks about the specifics are really popping off with goldenglue Zoe being one of the main one so getting him Comfort at the weld a plane goes a long way from is the other expensive option to go with beerus so we don't get any more Super long-range harrassment I was kind of hoping for another double Mage bottom Lane but Golden Gardens want to cover more bases and their last two pics they can round out their team fight so nicely you know cataclysm their works really well with Ferris makes it super easy to land a corrupting canes and Brom provide so much more structure for your team fight and meanwhile close or is it certainly on a lot of comfort here as well as when I can come through its pants down in the jungle as what we expected but is always an option of course Jarvan most overall but you look at the actual 10.6 patch closer like the driver not like the worldwide top-level pics at much is it close to fake a lot so looking now is time ticks down three. The line is there no obvious who's going to be on that second was very best we could win this one final game to get the playoffs this always kind of a staple pick because he's around is always useful a pop up when you're looking for that for that eight weeks super excited to get into this one though and break the tie once and for all freak break the tie once and for all 1 one that they had they're going to do battle here so one final time please for this game five minute break for competitive Integrity get the game some lead time then we'll broadcast you one for your very eyes the last spot in playoff comes down to this stick around will see you in five hello everyone and welcome back to the show the last spots in playoffs is up for grabs in the video video games about to begin but I won't do that again but we are well I got some extra spice to add on top for freak okay I like having social media open as well during these and closer just tweeted out before the game in 2019 worlds emanated us from World's today I'm taking my revenge and ending their hopes hashtags because also bang then tags hoody right under it so let him know and they're going straight for closest got his eyes on booty scratch all of the all the damage actually I think there's also in the in the the Clutch Gaming group I'm trying to remember cuz they were the unicorns of love in the group stage and that would have been Ryoma or not to sorry would have been king and the top layer of Siena Academy fudge and going to run around in the LCS Academy League unleash closer to be thrown down the flag of me taking his red bath without much of a problem pretty heavy leash for good types of Second City and I don't think I almost I know you got some help as well I based on where the Champions are so you know about us helping out here because they're trying to get topside where is going down I'm going to see if closer can pick up where he left off after the first minute of the game damage dealt to Hootie Jarvan is very good at going level 3 into instant Gangsta generally want to do double bus and just wrong because Jarvan doesn't have a lot of sustained isn't clear the jungle super helpful if you want to do full clear and stuff like that generally makes a lot more use out of getting something done with some good gang pressure especially since flag and drag is such a good thinking tool and that's exactly what he's doing love pup crawl into the ward for hunie got the board closing those are going to be there pops of sweepers and then walk back away and Acadian also kind of knows this right he's topside he's taking those crutches down please a small one back and then with the sweeper it actually less of a kind of spot out where clothes are killed the first man with that kind of Windows is not in the brush and Acadian done you'll have the chance of forcing a dive closer that was going to go for the rest of play he's stealing Redbone yeah I think he's really low hell they just want to push that one in the way it's okay I mean how much would you have love for closing towards that brush that hoodies in Flash
he's performing really well not just being the lady and see if I carry but he's also played much more aggressive than many other 80 carries in the league and it's kind of new for him to be doing and what we talked about I think we do have to look over in the flyquest camp and call out the fact that solo is a back in today for the tiebreaker game as compared to buy for who was subbed in yesterday and didn't find success and they were hoping for solo who has largely impressed us so far with only three games played in the 2-1 record is back in the lineup Philly field after nothing but shift gear for flag bus to take to a hundred thieves it pushes the needle in the right direction I do think that's all has performed better than Viper Viper did not look good yesterday at also make a lot of sense Tito back in here but I think it's hard to call just off of that one thing you know I'm really interested actually see what we're going to get here in the draft because I do think it's like was get something that that is really kind of comfort for them as power of evilwhen is the only guy who can take over a game and who can really carry black glass over a hundred thieves ignore having Playmakers meeting up with santorin how are people being a little bit more proactive than we are used to seeing him over the course of his career he's playing his like the Rumble that was that they were pulling out through the same thing with the already but it's just a humble is so I would like to have some power early for poe2 going to make his own plate and then ignorant is born to claim or around that will look like in the first game of the day with that math being the lock in behind that for flight Questyeah I think Cody's main Champions are all kind of band out now if I'm pretty curious with pollen going to go if they're going to end up doing the Admiral the kite there maybe they'll do the various pumpkins which is a pretty popular Lane recently Pumpkins band I'll call them right now Berenstain Bears still an option there still an option First Care Center that will be the pick up four hundred thieves so actually looking at the mid laner and a jongleur in fact would you would you expect then maybe a continued 80 Kerry pangere in the second phase of bands from Blacklist probably this looks like a pretty easy band 480 Harry's because right now you have the last pick you're going to be able to afford pick your jungle for a flyquest so they can actually just leave the rest of the supports up because all of them have counters now and use the your last big rig North to get the support counter but this is his go is leave their Midland Phil 4:5 and banal to Sandra and pick the Ori and try to bait power of evil into the re again cuz I think because a lot of these bands work on it doubts benefit only been actually 5 Marksman played by Cody done throughout this entire split only one that isn't taken away right now is the diet but they've been there caught so you know not available you can obviously still play xayah alongside other the forest but didn't mean to the see if it's a signifying a hundred fuse has something a little bit special prepared if they have something you know kind of like a Secret pink prepared because they are the ones Banning out a lot of the stuff that they were most commonly go to I was even saying I have a caisson and they've been well-liked yes I think I want to do a brown Blind Pig so I'm assuming you were getting jungle pick up like you called they'll probably in that fourth slot for flyquest now the response 454 thieves would they will have to pick up both there any Carey and support here so our questions will be answered soon around What's the Pic will be Kaiser two big ones that were called out the Brom Brom set brownies from Brownie and it wouldn't be brought me that's an old glass yet I mean we her Folly you just saying earlier about how Cody someone be able to play practice and have to doing that and that's going to split 10 signs before a typical for him he is truly no more like the guy who withstands Elaine your scaled up in the Takeover defy this is where they are going to look to really I think play in the faith of black West but I do have a choice of support counter they're going to go with the humidity so it's something I do think that MF could be somewhat vulnerable against something like they're the Brom Lucian and obviously there is the potential problems there but not exhaust to keep going bad that I think they probably complain more for making and cheese bites a little weird fairly early game cough with Lucien Brom and and not be more prioritize around killing bottling but maybe maybe they just want that to leave it sufficient so you can just leave Lucian from on its own you actually play more about outside maybe does well against things like the atrox in the pantheon it's one of the Champions that isn't just guaranteed dead if they actually jump in on you because you are fairly mobile and if you do have a problem with with Guardian with the shield being thrown up with exhaust there's the ability to actually just peel back and and kill off these frontliners as they are diving in because aatrox and Pantheon are not Champions that you need to have like seven stained front lines reading marksman to deal with right Lucien can kill those absolutely so now that we've seen the compositions locked in before we head to our competitive Integrity break I just want to get a sense from you guys we had a discussion about momentum and some of the success of the of the stars on hundred thieves and Ty break situations the substitution for fly Quest coming in but now that we've seen the compositions laid out for you to be squads where does our confidence life or who is going to be moving on to face Evil Geniuses for that second place slots steals my point is they have 28 Roxanne and Pantheon jumping in but I do think the fact that they don't have any easy Frontline to battle the brownie composition I think it's going to be very easy for a hundred days just to pick a Target and kill whatever they hit it first I was already with under these before the draft I think the draft is is fairly easily to ask you how you can just hit anything click it's not like you have to play the fights in a complicated way he'll back they've got lots of seeds be absorbed engage in and kill off a truck scale Pantheon well if these are looking to steal this one away from flyquest move themselves onto face Evil Geniuses to lock up that second slot in the playoff picture either way both of these squads are in the postseason guaranteed top for the teams will be in the rift in just about 5 minutes we do have to head to a break for competitive Integrity issues as usual so I'm sure freak and Kobe will see you guys on the other side of that 5 minutes hello everyone and welcome back to the lcf get the game started up very soon as they battle for a top spot in the playoffs second third and fourth place all tied in the regular season this battle is a fight for will if you lose you get 4th and if you win you fight Evil Geniuses for a chance at the second speed we're going to see this going on pretty soon do the quick pause ignoras restarting a computer this is the battle for the battle and it's a little bit but it means that cloud 9 cannot choose you early on and everybody wants to avoid Cloud 9 as long as possible until you know you eventually will have to play them people are assuming in the finals I definitely think that I did leave so I can announce his talking about have a good chance that that because they have been a team that has been surging towards the end of the split rather than a lot of the Winds coming from the beginning right that's great I know we saw some sweet few days ago about VLC of stock market and people like buying in a pair of all the analysts but negative start at $5,000.42 or under apparently due to a clerical error will save the Maya and none of these the very beginning and then hopped off the train at least I thought I did apparently I didn't know the record Good Enough by sitting with them so analysts that mean that you've been making changes and they've just been ignored because the entire split we have to keep every two weeks making changes to the purchases and I was like okay I'm all in on CLG now cuz like they would like I would get posted posts like my my like portfolio value and I'm like okay fealty then and then like 2 weeks choose a path that you're there for the other guy right I'm going to stick with the LG okay
is it just that final step of closing out the game because actually mentioned they were in such fine position with an ocean soul in that last game and yet it slipped away but I'm looking at these veteran names like Asos vacation that they should be able to be a really smart players and I think you could have triggered a lot of their leg in victor e as to how they shot call the game but and their game against dignitas they almost we're trying to be to create how to win the game and they're trying to split push and they're trying to command bearing instead of just grouping Auntie fighting with their ocean. Hopefully I'm a bit more clarity today and they can actually see how to win the game the more they let it slip through their fingers the last time they played dignitas with a lead but they get one more crack addict see if they can move on baseball and Guardians 4th at 6 and final spot in the playoff picture we are going to let them roll to the first base bands before I hand it off to our casters for the call of the first game of the day Rumble looks like it'll be the sixth and final Banff alongside a couple Marksman and a mid laner there for dinnerso we're kind of playing the field at the moment of Elliot's being locked in immediately and that's my two casters take it away the deaths as I am freaked alongside the water and guess what Johnson already got one and only most played that's Champion by far it's a failure has his eighth Play We Are the Champion twice as many more than twice as many as every other AD carry that they have gone for and it really does show showed yesterday in the team fights did a ton of work in the late game good aggressive plays in there as well as Mortals probably wouldn't answer with Miss Fortune down here and I think it's worth spending a lot of time and Mortals built at their Peak ac7658 gold lead with ocean soul and threw it all away by failing to take any kind of a decent fight they could type is the pantheon The Mortals played against him he was piloting at at one does have the point-and-click CC to set up I actually love Pantheon in the jungle right now this bite the low solo queue win rate because it does open up so many options for you with power diving having the directional Immunity on your Shield as well as setting up other forms of CC on your team still having this Champion already locked in for dig I could look for you know hiregy PSI Cassiopeia or something to really carry a late game team fight because I can't connect to set her up and protect her early, but together we're going to weigh the first or the second thing to pick to see women there does come through as going to wait for a top laner most likely as well I felt waiting around for the final phases of bands back to getting dropped off away from Houdini Mordecai's think we'll go unpicked here in this one I think they are maybe off that I finally won but honestly 173 mordekaiser victory for noon yesterday top different County game of this was something else skills then deaths Apollo was dead that gay make only had one and it was it was a threat let's be real that was thrown into playoffs instead either of these teams has 220 to make it into the Posies they must win this game and then an hour from ven play Golden Gardens wind that game as well that will be the fight with a stick and final 8th seeded team which means nothing for you in Spring split as a yeah and it looking at the team's out already talked to her already looking at Immortals hard engage they got such a whiny and said some of the best part and gave you can have a champion for champion in the game right now so they're trying to figure out what sort of Carrie they can actually get for frog that is not going to go down yet RZR 1000 with the Leona this is hard hard dive comp and they've got Misfortune coming over the top so Immortals like the endless s kind of touch. I'm going for one of those giant AOE five-on-five hard engage HR come through the top 5 lb the answer to set here for Hootie and is now for a couple bands already through so he wants to play with probably a week I mean for a dig site but I think it would work for a mortal side as well instead they're going to do with the Poke for a little bit more pick potential here you know they already have long-range PC with such Lonnie and Leona if you hit someone with a sleepy trouble bubble that is easily followed up by either of those two tanks in the front line so yeah the cleanses I think will be necessary for as many calories as they could actually take them on which will right now the Frog and & Johnson no real surprise pics coming out though no new Champions entering the arena much more of the standard okay so hard engaged a lot of ways to move in and close out game. Through the goal for them it was the inability to do so that deprive them of an automatic playoff spot already so nobody's over Correction Facility Who has had problems closing out games in a conventional way a lot of their wins have been through a Bruisin back doors and TP plays of whatnot so we'll see if a very obvious team fight if you can work for them meme on dignitas it's a lot of comfort who is a truck is good frog Hands by far the most played as the Oriana Johnson's by far most played as the fellas Do It Center to fight go very well for them of course we are going take a five-minute competitive Integrity break we'll be right back after that with the games of stick around hello everyone and welcome back to the show game is about ready to begin and it is a battle for a chance at the sixth and final playoff spot dignitas the Blues by Immortals on the red the loser is just the 8th Place team you beat the LGBT liquid and your spring split is done we'll see you in summer if you win this game though you've faced golden Guardians in about an hour's time. Is the battle or third game of the day that battle will be the fight for the last playoff spot will see you in lower bracket and we'll see how far you can go we are out of the rift and it's going to be an exciting one as we got to figure out who can take this one home things happened so they tweeted out themselves once again a game on a fellow's for Johnson I mean he has been popping off of the champion yes it's been nerfed in 10.6 I don't think everything is a playlist but certainly a mortal thing didn't can they love first pick in it so that is something to watch for absolutely looking at a fairly standard spread of Champions so far overall do you want to plan on going to Mortals have gone for a very very heavy engage draft the set the stage Juanita Leona all really good at going forward this is a team that feel they have pulled a lot of interesting sort of comeback wins in late-game a conventional game endings have not been what's good for them they threw a heavy gold against the guitar just two days ago I can't even doing the very standard drop a recall grab a sweeper get out of the map in a blast don't start the Red Bluff looks like for him released from his bottom line Madewell Szechuan e and set by the way incredible jungle start at you always start. Sevani set has really good attack speeds you just keep stacking a permafrost getting a stun triggering it and stacking up against a very very very fast leash so I expect me to be low BMV Auto do owls kill it and you going to be said they have the pantheon just like getting an arguably less Autos less damage from the team in the league Dracula face by the white Leona has a really hard time do anything level one I would argue that it's easier to be a nautilus Johnson has the attack range lead here as well so definitely going to be powerful modeling for over 2 minutes now that yet Zillow cast for now while we are you if you was Kobe a he will be back pretty soon into this game and then you'll know in the meantime test my shots like it's maybe 2006 or something back when you almost never actually do o cast online games really throws me back to the Warcraft 3 days so we can hopefully do pretty well here curly mid-length looking pretty standard here is frog in almost always an Immaculate sir yes sir I do want to point out the egg before it's a pretty good in his own right here was walking back and forth but not really really really powerful you have the range leave if you if you don't Dodge the key with an extra cute Plus Auto attack it's that the million damage that point is going to Apollo going to have to try to run away thankfully does have similar heel plus the sorcerer and everything else to just really get away from that one but that one's going to hurt and ice cake in the early game for a kitty inside from this down a little bit earlier on do want to point out that he is actually two camps ahead right now in an idiot attaching award to his location is now they would rather take the crugs
things you can exploit people on leave up that mordekaiser I don't think he play the orange but maybe you do pull it out just to stop him from being able to to play that as a stable pick Center hit the band table first stop in Champion Select we're going to head right back over to freaking Kobe though to get us into our second game of what could be a very long day thank you very much and I'm excited to finally fit in a small window on my monitor and I can Austin area is left for us and yes there are three a minimum the tiebreakers on The Dating the tops to follow the road that goes and is pray that he zhi does work meanwhile psmo beef tendon with that little speed bump for themselves now they might be starting to sweat a little there's another champion that was at the heart of it last NFL EOS pick up that was that was a tough one coming in will see if that same performance shows up yet again going to make you wish you hadn't Guess My Number One Step Players Bar stage games that we've seen very good to go after affiliates with a champion a Philly host but it has a really easy time of dunking someone to go over to a family has Broken Blade isn't very good with flashing getting facebreakers on the back line so I think I just is going to cause a little bit of trouble for Johnson is going to have to be very cognizant of his positioning and that of his Frontline so that Broken Blade doesn't use his own steam spaghetti back there and kill him Beyond or anybody was really impressive that border guys are flights so Jo Frost by The Four Tops yeah you any idea that's definitely up there it's try to get it back there to to be a belly also probably involves price to you, which is kind of weird because a lot of the time by Owl frogs has played Super aggressive support but it has been a very good job of farming up for those teeth by yeah they should help them really really well the the you be alongside someone like that where you know she loves riding on Camilla Champions you both know there's a lot of CC available there someone to get back to Johnson on a Philly Austin even though Tom ketchel them that you need a giant play so as soon as they're failures pops back out you can bop them on the head like one of those carnival games play a very standard front-to-back team finally going to go out and it would be a great option there yeah and honestly Zoe is a very good blind pick Blanc are literally the two most popular on on the last like three patent liners but with them being removed it does bring up the Beltway slack victim act up once again all right here is a very standard brick by releasing something yep early game aggressive that's going to be at 8 in front of make the difference in the early games and now there's an answer listen to make slaves so let's hear for reaching a bit for me for I mean set is fairly difficult to create place on because of the Regeneration the possibility of Duty 1 ending with a shield with the bait mean well as real and you me very difficult for at least we did track down and maybe we'll go for some jungle 21 jungle pressure because we've seen with the extra Mobility can definitely crate good skirmishes versus the stage 1-e if the state doesn't have step right next to jack up the passes quicker just now coming up right here I believe 10 wins does not guarantee you top four because egn none of these can join that as well but it really makes it easier to get there it's going to be exciting to watch for right now dignitas playing for their playoff life TSM try to move up in the standings getting top for obviously pretty useful their overall self commercial break for competitive Integrity of a champ select is done so stick around back right here with game 2 and they say I have a grim sense of humor hello everyone and welcome back to the show The Ultimate or pedals but then we have a s m r Covey as well as regular old annoying listen to David free and it's going to be a great buddy to Kobe I'm excited for Ledo X going to do great what exactly is M vs. dignitas into these team fight monster safety here for the backline a zero self field Israel has self peel you me on either of those carries can greatly support the backline like you talked about in champ select can help out with the engage for either dardarkom broken plates 02 very clear game plan here want to get those five-on-five group set up stage of the game meanwhile dig with the little last pic kind of curveball of the lease in maybe they try and force you know some skirmishes or something to make this pic worth it because otherwise Leeson will get out of jail by the state Sewanee heading to five on five then to try the group up and it's going to really Force Acadian to reach for some really big plays some insects may be in our future to to have some value there okay okay. Do you know what looks like no leash here for Kaden on the red that's not going to be too difficult for him broke up with no going to help start off being the true homie could help police that Red Bluff up their wrap up start the book jumper I like how they're actually Tru homies to if you watch any of the DSM content. Dakin broken played really good friend Stars really funny to watch a little interaction super outgoing and those two in game on the rift is it have also been a big part of tsm's Victories to trying to get across their team fights for them and this time around you'll have the same the same duties right Broken Blade looking to get to the back line trying to take down 80 carries start off trying to engage on those fights for him mess with a poop comes out there Johnson does have a lot less to stay in early gone with the 16 nurse there a lot less healing on out several 4.6 rather 10.6 so that pokes going to matter quite a bit and he was very very slowly sustained backup Rover by take some nice layout and I do like seeing or players lose so it is more doable now to do something early in Lane because of the nurse to the Democratic brittle proc but it doesn't seem like we have seen that really abused since 10:00 6 day of 10.6 came out and I'm still kind of waiting for it
both these guys are standout players on their damn I have been pretty impressive closer throughout the split I do think both of them have the ability to get an aggressive early but closer it's usually the one to do it more often so I think in this game it's more'n santorin to contain closer and closer to be the proactive player to try to get some these Lanes what you may expect to lose and isolation ahead we'll have two teams hit Champion Select the first Target for Golden Guardians is that work on and ignore trying to remove some of his engage opportunity but with that like you to hand it over to a casters to take off art or not maybe I'm going to hold just been informed that we are restarting Champion Select by a producer so we're going to hold here on the anal sex or just another moment felis and let the teams get reset in the Champion Select don't have a jack word on what went wrong there Morpheus outfit by the waysounds good see what I was doing and where we need glasses I don't have those I don't have is the morphe that he actually doesn't wear just black he has a it's a purple shirt and a green tie it up but they going to let you know if you can you can build the pot that these are good foundation some good building blocks you establish to becoming very much a sew-in in that wardrobe for the at home broadcast you don't need me last week he is Morpheus it up this time around. I've never seen swear I have an outside yet you have not I'm impressed man or did your girlfriend give it to you this is the family like Christmas tradition that the zimmermans is my momgive me some like ridiculous amount of sweaters I probably have thrown out dozens of sweaters she's getting ready in this town right now Mark what do you want to do because I love alive heart back up onto my screen with Patrick on been hitting the table all wait for the ACT will go ahead and toss it over the cats but I want to get your opinions real quick on the way the Champs like developing fat Target towards the rakan in a Pantheon to follow through what do you think of golden Guardians attack plan so farit does seem to me like they are trying to limit a lot of flak West easiest engaged option so like if they are going to go for a heavy pushing bottle and they have other things in smoothies to leave if it's not the ziggs pantheon with one of your biggest concerns about being able to Stanley jump onto them from from anywhere on the map is supposed to work on starting things off though it could be telegraphing some some more bot Lane aggressive fix think the band is actually really smart because the FBI has been spamming the champion his free trade games on it has look good in all those games so removing that as an option makes a lot of sense taking way too fly Quest is but the first band phase I am going to hand it over to the cap is officially that first game of the daythat's right dash it is my time to shine hello everyone in the welcome separated by The Last Jedi standing death by the way so what level are there talking about eating are in the various before that he's played by far his most played of all the different Champion so he's the rakan and easy engaged at very clearly something golden Guardians have focused on here then one of the first pick of belly looks like so many other teams in that if you have very quick engages and easy Duns & Fifi I can compete in a gated very quickly but it was FBI special Champions champions in The Meta who protected him a little bit and they've got themmanatts work ethic anymore I expect to see the pic rate decline over time for now though teams account for playing any certainly viable don't get me wrong to be working here but to be honest and that they've been the dearest thing no affiliation up here at the pic I'm curious of what they expect to counteract this with fine with them now while the MF is a very strong later as well if you can get the correct double up there so I do like we're wild turtle as like with the boxes for the course they do have viper in this is one of the big story for the match that got him Renekton already it is other team a flexible Champion I would say it's not really going to be a power of evil Champion but he has proven us wrong on other assumptions that we made about him so I could very well be moved around still passhas played Mala Chambers but they've been Diana Rumble and Tiana they've been traditional mid laners as far as I'm concerned like looking at at the end of History right now so yeah Renekton having is going to be a rally up but that's the weather right now again not going to go do something like that but they do nose do is the mid lane so I'm curious what they do answer with lot of attack damage I'll look at 6did you get here look at your big bird kill enough has the Super long-range yeah surprised Pikachu Toby this is this is the most surprised Pikachu you're like you know other teams play with black rim so I don't think this is any sort of crazy thing from like what they're taking it very seriously they know that they need them into this game to try and lock one of those top spot in second place very important for playoffs and with him on the road exit with a blade of the ruined King bucks this is where the first Champions I thought of as causes cluster their play the road king with your empowered W absolutely yeah I think he's definitely very good and I am through see what happens because I agree with what if there was saying was that solo has been playing well I think he's been a pretty dominant player right wrong that Arthur has been good they have to do First Blood match 3 games display and it said yeah you replace wiper going to keep this guy if they can flexes to top laners that's pretty Rhythm band I didn't go for it anyway they put them on something more conventional I think if I should expect wristbands down the line is going to prove it here on non ribbon and that is I think the good choice for testing the water tubing to the know which which of the two actually want to bring Dairy out of the draft now fly by Celine jungle are cold and Guardians the same as I've got a mid laner a top laner and robot Lee yeah and the Alistar the engaged for ignorance still come just in a different form here out there hasn't been super popular recently but don't have a lot of good luck to you need to put a little bit more effort into your vision control because I'll start does the media lights blinks a little bit more than Raton didn't have to think that we're gone as well just needs to be used on the golden Guardian side and it's the early game jungler for closer isn't very well with getting leads for the team on Earth Gang compilations are excise app and. First flood at level 1 to toppling was really strong overall I I'd like is it feels pretty Uncle parade the back teeth bite from forest kind of hitting people in in fashion basement gutter Alfred to get Bosco Paxico he's feeling cool down to the passive is a lot shorter so we'll see him sustained ocean stealth and it's a bit more easily in lane and orange yeah and the trundle is a really funny because santorin after he came yesterday tweeted out zero practice games on trend of zeros trim King struggle but he got the wind are the other stage they're so good to go for Round 2 found success the song Champion trundle is very good I think there's not that many to self don't like me to throw up a pill and be like yeah I think pretty solid can guarantee exactly seconds be with the wind golden Guardians must win and get help for a chance at making playoff the stakes couldn't be higher for these two teams will see here after 5 medical pet him take a break with the game hello everyone and welcome back to the show
I can Mortals in a best-of-five scenario because sure they might have the potential to drop one game to a pop off like dignitas but they are probably not going to lose three in a row in about 5 scenario if they got to get it done here though today with a single victory over take me to talk to move into that Sixth and final playoff spot clinched it all up and moving sales in the postseason The Mortals think it talks back over the chapters one more time close out today once again to the last cast of The Sixth and final playoff game with the wind right now in Mortals wins nine wins nine wins will always clinch playoffs base and how it's going right now meanwhile the Digger talk fan the Team Liquid fan and golden Guardians fans are all straight for the guitar fingers crossed for all those jeans that are depending on this big ass to win a lot of teams outside chance to still make it but a mortal can close the door on that picture of their playoff spot dignitas though pretty exciting game last weekend and I'm really excited to see if he's willing to look for the pic like that thing Cloud 9 go to furoshiki number 22 all right well as getting removed here as well as brings out the mordekaiser and belly of water damage already early on and just becomes incredibly difficult for someone like you warned you actually out of your healing rather so that is really really tough to deal with that being said or you can almost always play defensively enough that you're not actually fighting for every single CSU can warm it up you can still be in the device and we haven't seen more of that affects the cross the ALCS split so fast track and Hootie get enough of an advantage for the make this worthwhile and with this potential lock in here of Nautilus that will be the full bottling locked in for dignitas where what is a gone with mid jungle cancion as well as that's in jail that is a really really powerful to be to around mid lane is also incredibly strong enough to utilize room enough for stop by Pantheon altering insyndra rap 7 priority in that Midland so we're going to see offset and now we're dignitas very likely going to be targeting bot laners for Mortals mortals can be targeting at Mid and jungle Duo trying to get the most out of these early pics of hickeys yeah it'll probably would be wonderful there is why I wouldn't be shocked as deeply as soon as you're bottling hasn't done it this year but only if you're going for it maybe you see that one broke through and you put the pantheon I got to know where is playing something else maybe we can agree there is no chip to see the person Fort Bend come through already I like him to the second one came through as well so you can stop and have to speak out there somewhere, off as a hospital special into Nautilus that's obvious kills to block that is not an ultimate time to blackfield it if it's used from any sort of range that death-stars though it is definitely one of the four through the LPS that is willing to go to work some of those range pics of course if you want to go for a more option there's still things like anch which could make sent along a pic like the pantheon add more Stanley Global threat to one can be definitely strong so we'll see if it does come through the jungle ready stuff for themselves right now is Top Lane to find out if you want to play mid laner or if they want a pic of a triangular and wait to see what else the rest of going to be Olaf have you locked in there for Acadian in good hope you can get a lot done with that a very interesting seeing you lost lost in is a really strong through lead anchor when paired with someone who has really strong walk down like the Nautilus so has the ability perhaps it was laying eggs and things like that can be actually set up by that Nautilus also will give you a really strong to be to topside when you already have that winning match up with the mordekaiser for Zoloft shows up you do expect when any of those types of matchups defensive I think it makes sense if you're looking play mostly around top and mid with his Fancy on and happy as drill you could even go to something like that song and she didn't want to go really defensive do you think I should be okay here also yeah but the odds are in your glory it's do-or-die time and they go back to Old Comforts floriana for frogging complete as to this is what I hear by the Ariana going to make sense especially alongside that Olaf people love that combo speed them up Shield them up in the middle of the team look for that Shockwave also good follow-up available off of the walk down that a nautilus does for by but as you did highlight this is the same bottle and we actually talked previously from CLG but if a leo send Nautilus or not the Champions that can really dominate it's actually hard or Nautilus to actually engage into a top cuz if you hook the Azrael he can get devoured of you actually hold on Tom and then threaten you with the Atlanta police tow is going to be likely more of a farm-style lane and I do think a lot of the game is going to be decided on whether or not Anthony on and make things happen especially around this midlane you can send it feels like is Eleni want to fight around and that does leave them with early limited often and I'm looking at dignitas and I'm looking at its difficulties and it's totally out of no where they've got open spot at a playoff but you know the odds are getting lower the odds of getting a lot of bok in playoffs with the wind so much tomorrow hello and welcome back to the show with LCS time and of course now over a thousand Playoff scenarios possible we're down to just 64 right now it's all of them and with The Mortals making playoffs identities below the make it in if Immortals wins this one here today we'll see if it comes through we do have some is Griffin ready to go as well let's get into as Immortals fight for that last playoff but I was at the top who's hoping to do the same can be exciting one we're going to have to seek and dig the playoff hopes alive or not only themselves but golden Guardians DL all these teams now cheering for dignitas in Immortals really looking to close the door and seal the deal here become that final playoff beef and then tomorrow we'll just be all about playing for seeding just incredibly important when you are looking for that top for to be playing from the upper back to be playing for double limb very very important and no one has any sort of dominating lead except work last night also want to point out that there is exactly one scenario left with six tiebreaker games and if you want that you were also rooting for you in this one just saying that's what would be on the table here have you still got a bunch of different scenarios available for Mass tiebreakers question is can dignitas stop a 1 and 6 second round robin streak for the only beat 10th Place CLG can it be the time they Buck the trend it's been a really lackluster and they brought a new jungler and akkadian that didn't seem to help very much either but they're going to do the very best it is one thing they can strike audible didn't have a really good start with a split or call they were born too early on frog and one player of the week he was popping off it seems like this was going to be a roster that they do some big things but it just has not been able to remain consistent and it felt like what was truly season advantage or dignitas weather was never asked kind of tailed off further into season we got that Advance has dwindled away Yep they're still
sound reducer take me to split the map that I think they galio is Big with that as well you already have a dominant oplinger give a dominant bot Lane do not allow them to have a mid laner who can move around the map so easily who can enable those with the map and it got to avoid what you were trying to do right exit what happened to get a lot of pics in the jungle allow them to get a lot of a side length plays that really kind of set Immortal so far behind before they even got there first thing but that's true that's why I wanted to talk about it that if you have gone so you can't deny both want to pick them and I don't have expect to see Darren early or anything to really really really with a poplin dominant now instead for the galley or like to see if we can decide their kind of awkwardMidland Shanty decision because of this but I still think this is kind of playing it a little bit in 200 you can we'll see what they want to drop the ones that the f--- if they do take it but you are expecting him to go for that you do think that they are especially after last game a massively better macro team playing the map you know more intelligently I think than one mortal did do what will the Immortals can actually match them in a fire for fire if they go for galio you're going to have to be a galley on one side presumably will have some sort of Carrie alongside the tfv4 someday to try to just match that I alternatively they could just put some day too strong of on something a little bit more safe and play down towards the font Lane just try to enable FBI and who he is a all right with Dan Mcneil Gallia were to win through Botley we're going to stack dragons and play there there have closer on Braves another Power farmer hear another raise DPS of course it is physical but we'll seethey want to take it for Top Lane yeah that might be the late answer at the very end to your curious if he's going to have misgivings I'll be at the answers to what he did is Lily asked if they have a mix of damage pipes outside and then you just take me to Sabatino's you're almost you do it not inside that either right physical damage to Elaine's magic damage in the jungle wouldn't be shocked if you had another therapy now. Can you play you know nothing about late they look who got in a physical will will switch it up and you know they still made play the medic tile in the jungle you know what you might still be able to renew her in this kind of competition. For this going to be down the line but looks like hundred thieves are not going to go for toppling just yet Phil let something to eat more baths can stop it wouldn't make no sense who has not even played it yet in lock in I don't really see flashes as this all-powerful champion at all these days maybe they were really worried about like a direct Elisa or something but CF then not even taking value yourself now almost just like Doom toast a bun you put them on a carry but now he's going to have tire fixed and you have do you have to play towards it like what is the Camille really supposed to get done I just already worried that your top leader is absolutely screws here sure as far as if you're if you're going to drop these dinner bot Lane no damage style and it makes sense to have Lucien in the mid lane but then why would you go for the Camille why not just go towards tank top Lane that needs less resources or go towards another enchanter Tom plane because having Lucian mid that draws your jungle right Roz you no pressure there so it does feel pretty strange we just see if you're in the Dragons band out so trying to protect the phone up on that top side brightness can be played in the bot Lane but mostly we haven't seen play top link these days the realm and sent me that I want to play a sport because well as great into those likely Jonas that's feels like it's telegraphing that they want to play on a bot Jack's is a gray internet Camille you can win the lane early you out scale in the one do you want to guess what he is DF on his game so now we're already play the game anymore mashup again someday who has a GF on his team and that was your first pick like what is a cat with that they got nothing so I feel like hundred do you spell already practically checkmated them on this draft they do go for the Leona which was kind of you know what it is you're telegraphing that they wanted when they banned out the real because of that matchup but they could still just go straight to the Alice are they clearly knew what they wanted to do with that last pic if we only got taken to go immediately to the Alistar 5th grade engage on the bus side they have a winning side lengths winning 131 I think the team fight you know it's more subjective it's going to be obviously down to how to play it out but this is going to be a really really tough game for Mortals with the ignite teleport being covered I wonder if it's going to be that kind of that kind of crazy on me so I'm Bill we did see a little bit from Vin at World's but I am expecting cuz of the melee matchup with he won't go there I think he's just trying to try to Cheesman all in early it and pray that you can win Lane that way but you know if I'm play Top Lane and I play against and ignite top laner you just play defense of early and wait for your TF2 come and you don't fight before that pretty much and in that case it becomes very very difficult for them to get anything done with that then flashes just worth much more when you are in the v u v and ignite in a really does kind of taper off as far as its value in the one's he won the further you get into the game in my Xperia you have border health bar in just your office the village in the first place like that one of the nine Champions played more than 10 times Genesis lowest win rate champion at 31% across like almost 30 plays it has not been successful for him he is once again on a supportive role with this team he's there to help dilution the Camille set up so he's going to bring some crackers hold down there I know it isn't going to be popular in this patch is very very good with gale-force we are sold 1.1 / gale force has a shortcut to a good Champion he just has not been successful on it himself which is get off of me to put a pin in and then watch as it goes down not expecting to get them to get a lot done down in the bottom Lane and again at level 6 going to have to go to one of those sides and it's not going to get really scary when it comes through Jackson I was up and kill but obviously something else down there with Jenna No Escape so might be a tough one to run for a 25-minute Nexus semifinals it's going to have to be something pretty special hear from a mortal sin does feel like it may need to come from the mid lane Lucian with the cleanse here into the TF maybe can get some sort of inventors there if they can get pretty going maybe there's a way in for this game but it's going to be really really tough so it is so it makes more sense to Omni Stone I think is more of a arrange matchup type thing and that's kind of where we thought being used at Worlds grass is really strong four-lane it is the best of the rooms as far as you do melee vs. melee for your laning phase it allows for really powerful trade we just get the cuegrass product plus you're passive for the physical damage Shield it makes it difficult for your phone is going to trade back into that and grass plus ignite is pretty much the strongest possible you were laying can get unless you want to forgo tell pork completely and go with flash at night but that's just really not something you see in competitive play ignite exhaust at all ignite exhaust igniters on all right that's unfortunate. Yep potluck on the chicken so this information they gave we don't know about and not me some day does Bronson top or cannot quit pushing all the way out but does for Sunday enough that he's not going to take him to damage after this done so no big harms their I'll just see you some wanted to let grass come out so hops away but closer or snowing the invade happens is okay you let chickens to read I will go Blue to your red and I'm now curious how many other camps it's going away composer choose to wait and get crutches as well can he you know going to take the chickens on top is Potluck exhuming down the toilet, as well as the dash so we just gets a red so he is going to be down one Camp overall I will see how much that does end up mattering because of course there are scheduled to fight over and take over Dodge God that is a couple hundred Health off of someday top put it really nicely and we know everyone saw him down the dragonpit as he gets the Red Steel on topside Hill not far for 45 seconds so free time to fight up there to get the better of the trade was really a message on new generally speaking if you're on the back but you want to have your hair is on your. Stone on the deck of The Counter Strike up for when they hook shot and then they hook shot into you but you have the dog Zone available to get to take to damage in the Sun but they can't actually followed up with any sort of Auto attack so that's why I kind of got excited they're seeing that was actually expiring as he was going to be going in for the hookshot to wouldn't have that available and as a result he does get somebody fairly low but Sunday is playing crafting potion has biscuits on his going to be able to sustain up quite a lot here so we'll see all right big man and now it feels like it's a must-have skill up on top side if you do not kill off someday here with his way of pushing away from him it already feels like you are so doomed somebody isn't really bad spot but these are too damn good at these Dives this was so perfect making sure I hit FBI cast Billy Jonas we could actually get full damage in on the 80 land his W-2 praca Plasma on both of those as well and really really really nicely done and they do the same thing as they did the previous game as well where they reset the a grown entry. The second player and now who he on the road here has no flash good night just yet to Camp leave for potluck but killing this is for closers I miss you way way better and this is Off to the Races again under these up 7800 gold outstanding yep and then anything about who he being up there is you're worried at the jacked when you are pushing in the way of his kind of in that neutral position because you don't know where Lily is you know Camille has ignite that is where you died you're going to die in this Lane the movie being up there even though they're organic didn't work it gives him the freedom to shut that it because now Camille can all it because he doesn't know where the Alistar is who he stayed up there for a long time didn't show anywhere to make sure they had the safe to do that so somebody got a free recall is PP was down goes back to base refill the potions buys another Ward and to be feeling pretty comfortable I think at this point in the line you're feeling great so far under these I have just a very small see us deficit in top and meaningful but everywhere else in the mat basically the assistant Devonte pastry she asked about like I'll be asleep just completely trashed by The Immortal side so easy easy riding so far you can see they're not walking towards that dragon as Joey can try to play for the Disney very safe right now Eeveelution could move first bought like pressure out of a dragon pretty early on I want to see a potluck and get a thing done now cuz he has a two-level weed in a full two levels you can see closer is closing in on level 5 but currently closed doors level four and recalled is level six right now if you can get something done immediately without ultimate without an image that you do have then maybe there's a way to start calling back injury reading more of a lead for yourself I like to do a good job with yearly jungle pathing and he stole two camps away to just the one is closer and closer not going to pull off that bought Lane time you'll be very far ahead so public needs to do more than just need to be proactive make use of this early ultimate and try to get it killed try to dive Top Lane now and see if you can kill off some day use this ignite use the Lily ultimate because otherwise it's just losing value right now he's doing the best he can to adjust Farm I know you want to see gang Staffing multi-level to do something that's going to push the way there yet he's got a 3 Wave 2 wave lead. That's only something but it's not manifesting too much else has probably just goes for the damage build is doing fairly standard you would go play at steel cops and yeah what's feel pretty good about that one now being closer step up and looked What I Hear by nearly going to do this will be number to Super potluck and finally what go aboard of the Big T V when they're letting a multi-man sleep potluck getting it done the flash Q3 man sleep closer was very low already had jumped over the wall and Immortals as a result are able to clean up that bite and close the gold lead quite a bit so actually ahead three hundred gold at this point and doing very well and it's a it's a nice play in the needed one for them and in what was feeling like it was a game heading towards how to do use favor but it's closer did go for the invade their oh this is a really want to play do you still have to be done shut up Sunday
do all the nine win teams are in there so like as in Evil Geniuses in we met we mentioned in the Cadillac gaming up here against golden Guardians in our fourth game of the day golden Guardians hoping to keep their playoff hopes alive with a victory here we'll see if they can do it as we had it back over to the casters for the callthank you very much. You're welcome back to the freak is bail is by my side at the park if not physically to follow up and close at that point Cloud 9 flyquest Evil Geniuses TSM and husband fees are all locked into the LPS 20/20 Springs flip flops there is one slot left up for grabs in a morals and golden Guardian are the four teams trying to pile of the clown from the only fit one shot they just need to win one of their two games and if they can do that then they will be in the playoffs the other scenarios require pretty crazy stuff going to Immortals going o2.pl beating C9 then you have a three-way tie at 8 that's really the only way that you like the LR golden Guardians could get in it would have to be this kind of crazyscenario so we'll see golden Guardians so obviously going to do their best to win out and try to finish on a high note the LG also looking for the same and I've got to stay until g-side a lot of these guys really looking forward to next find a prove that you deserve to keep spot on this roster that you are worthy of being on this damn it I think we'll be out there at 1 at Mid Blitz game he has really proved his worth I have been very impressed individually with his play and I think mother is Don CLG or some other team I'm pretty confident about their having LCS Squadronyeah definitely a strong player will see if course we know CLG can not get out of last place 9th is at 6 winds right now sealed you cannot get about five to matter what happens they are going to end at number ten but yes about rebuilding what is a title and a chance to go to MSI there's still the first timer 10 place in car wash it off in and get as good as you can to make that trip for the world's happen if you can make it and right now you going to see the golden Guardians they are hoping they must go to oh and if they can do it maybe there's a chance to make that last playoff spot for me and it seems like you just wanted to know why the most common pairing with ferrets over on that other side but it also leaves you with defensive Autumn Lane that I don't really see howwe are going to be having winning to be due on the bottom side regardless of who guards his is actually paired up with a couple games that I can recall we're both at LaFollette iberus folk style which is really strong for laying especially with confidence porch guaranteed hit on your e good help them get ready there they have locked into Jarvan alongside that a try to be strong outside Scooby-Doo and it's going to give oxygen to actually look for those really gangster me we just saw that we just totally just saw a check and get for a splendid level one it was almost a bit more reliable in a certain sense but would play out Golden Gardens of Fellini's magic damage requesting go to be to play a mage of course but in the case that they're going to get out ofyeah you be will get banned out I don't feel loved to see something like a Zyra Al oxide varistor to come to I do think that against Lanes like this pumpkins as well to have to leave early defensively TVs black tie rod and punish you incredibly hard I think you can throw things like alcohol is in Brandon that kind of boat as well that's if you're going to go Paris alongside a can become pretty impressive Duncan Sheik barely taking as pretty good read n&n shielding's our ability but at a certain point that leaves a piece of work is really and punish you have weigh in at least consider the possibility of it into your idea you know it makes sense they're starving get the play to support you saw in the LED lightthe Box late as well so you know who exactly knows but we also saw it as Bard toppling their support actually was a thing for a while quite a while ago with the E-maxx and kind of that AP Jarvan that would Staci playing like that but style don't think that's what we're going to get we are going to have corki mid here. There's a lot of scaling gear in the mid lane record of defensive wayfarer-style champion on those eggs but what I think that's really nice about this big is the ability to actually Rome up and down and kind of had these halfway room down the river where you can get a cyst fights with your ultimate frighten you have Jarvan for the cataclysm walk people in bro the mega Inferno bomb on top of that for The Sweet Spot guaranteed if you don't have flash or Dash to get out and that could be a pretty strong and gauge combohere is well that's going to be exciting so fun to watch these matches has diarrhea or braces before but they're going to give you the ziggs I'm a crazy watch this I have not really much of any music support one things going to working for it I guess is you know if you're looking at something like a Tom can't you can disengage the Tom kench fairly easily with things like that Satchel I will give you a little bit more survivability perhaps against of these gangs compared to something like is our who doesn't have any of that type of disengage this is also something where you can punish her it's so heavily ziggs passivewhat time does so much damage to turrets and you're able to refill that very quickly casting her spells after you actually use that auto obviously the Satchel to destroy turrets I don't think he's going to put in W till later on so that still will remain at 20% or so execute on that trip but you're expecting to have a winning Lane ziggs is someone who really can help you cash in on those to her place and potentially knocked down there Lee turret so very cool stuff from Golden Guardians I respected it's week 9 take a swing for the fences here and see if you can punish one of these Tom canceling Rising by the way I look well today so if you pick rate has not spice and you were recently yet maybe today's game will make that happen either way exciting I love new things a chance to like we've got a Veris ziggs bottom line and we'll see if it works out going to take a five-minute commercial break for competitive Integrity so she after thathello everyone welcome back to the show LPS is here and I love it if I left my weekend that's absolutely true are five minute delay for about done so the first break is over and are bald heads are here that's true yeah my head is more balls than yours because that's true of this morning around the beard this morning okay but not bad not about that I'm not I'm not there yet I mean like like like at some point should I just not doing it yet made it to do you do you freaked out I will and your ability to make these choices but still G vs golden Guardians we're onto the roof is fighting for their playoff lives here it is a very far outside chance of them making it in butany scenario we're going guys make them to win here against the LG absolute the case must 200 and even then they need a bit of help fix place right now since the 8th when they need 202 from Immortals have a chance at the postseason Guardians what can they show for us here today will they showed us the ziggs I like it I think it's a cool, it is not statistically very strong and so lucky that doesn't have to matter if you can make the Rome's happened is the latest post give a bully get some pressure get some plates knock it down with the herald. Down the satchel and they can start Snowball the Steeler gameI'm really surprised I've got to say that FBI isn't playing the pope style there are some pretty tanky frontliners over on CLG so I think that's why is going lethal Tempo and should be playing on it but he had played a number of games in a row of The lethality varus playing that book style and alongside the Diggs I was actually expecting to see double, do
we're not putting the onus on the players in the situation was talked about this scenario is as we enter Champion Select the game 3 it's our turn to take Celexa will be walking you through this one is a first couple bands at the table by Jack u t l playoff hope it's dire even in a 2000 weekend you know they're still likely to end up in a tiebreaker at back for sure and because of what happened the first two games the theoretical possibility of 6 teams getting tied at 9 and 9 is still open if I lose this one and a flag in playoffs with a win here so it's super important for them if he's here then award-winning either of their game would keep Team Liquid out of playoffs because they have no way of getting tonight and the top six would all be at 9 already so we know the Team Liquid is looking forward to that cloud 9 game they have tomorrow but really it's all about the chew o they can't make any mistakes in the pressure's been on them the entire weeklooking for the 2-hour let's take a look at Champions like then and what they are choosing to eliminate in terms of options from flyquest pool that would be the set the pantheon and the center. I saw I find an interview that they're looking for the Rio more than the two of his if you get too low and you missed the tiebreaker I think that breaks your heart even more than then having to ten in the lck over about the past we can ask it got banned for most of the games in LEC and I kind of thought that Rose to prominence so quickly that we might not even get to see it in the ALCS the day I think it is absolutely the type of thing that Dublin core JJ can have high game and who is on so the fact they were able to get it I think it's promising or with tactical once I thought they even played it a little bit ago with SS and I know I was a little hit or miss on for JJ's Tarik what key does actually have one of the best Teryx if you think that showing at Eric days when they were spamming this just last year without a doubt they can use it as a flex right so it's still red side and Calista stop my guess would be that this is going onto going on about laying block nearly as well if that duo does go to the bar lynndale be up against the lovers in xayah and rakan another Power a power couple if you will be later picked up there right away powerview will blindly choosing the Sims right into Jensen's Zoe as a response I like it I think it gives you one of your powerpyx picked away from Jensen I think Center has been his best chance presented and it frees you up from having to sneak a lot of bands and some Midland so you can Target Bronx a little bit harder which is half the number of games in the second Fantasia's where they take away the lease in and in a couple of his best chance and it does seem to have impact on slowing brought down the early game both teams are playing for Jungle Band tear in the second phase 3 off the table already at least send signature picked Abraxas still available as of yet bundle as well I mean it would be boring but Rex I suppose so. I'm a little surprised to see the j4 band prioritized over the lease in Van I think you just count on leaving too hard to execute and you're probably okay taken sejuani trundle if you have to and then there's always a but there's the Rockstar syndra to combo it again because trundle would be able to counter I think because they're Zoe the cleanse value is too high I was surprised it wasn't just this is Justin Moore early games but if you're willing to do that I would have thought they make your own bot Lane with the least Cynthia theater and we'll see how you know where he said it's really good but they grab that here but I don't want to play that directs I personally better for them but I guess they have a lot of options at least got one go button in the Recon so I'm figuring that maybe Center scatter to to get a pic but a very solid team comp your flag Last Stand guarantees are later themes by over the LIE cuz if you hit mid-game when your lead-in find anyting you're doomed where I'm at least trundle Taylor can help you set something up and try so I don't think it does much with cinder in the early game versus snowy I would have liked to see something a little bit more aggressive by the jugular cuz D Ellis all early game here basically Zoe trundle might have a hard time trying to keep up in control that I love the rain but either way like we said both of these teams came looking looking to put together a two-out or as promised mentioned maybe a 300 weekend including a tiebreaker to sneak in the playoffs and defend their Championship on the flip side flyquest to at one point was being touted as the you know the true Contender to Cloud 9 has struggled recently brought so low in though and are really looking to see if he can be kind of the the glue that brings together the final product of flyquest living in the pussies any final thoughts too many of you gentlemen before we head into our 5-minute competitive Integrity break I love the spiciness of TL games there's a chance they miss playoffs after waiting for splits in a row is just too much every games enthralling back here in 5-ish minutes for game number 3 see you then I can talk hello everyone welcome back to the show LPS is beer a time that'll be back alongside the guy that way hopefully gets directly at the sale directly good job I'm proud of you that's a good start so yeah I mean obviously we are in the last week of The Elephant Back of the Season we are no closer to knowing which teams make it in the playoffs because almost every game we could have had so far could have locked the team in or out of playoffs and haven't gone that way yet so we still don't know it's pretty crazy that we are only one team has a lock I feel like traditionally going into week 9 a lot of it is already kind of locked out if you're playing for a spot or two at the bottom we still don't even know second place right there seems have nine wins and now hundred these is one of the amino up there with Aflac West TSM EG all these teams that again nine Immortals just behind them at 8 and then TLS 7 hoping that they can do something miraculous this weekend and catch up but it'll also require some of these teams to drop some games yeah and that's what it comes down to I know. hard for them they've got I like by far the hardest thing to schedule they're playing the teams that are literally right now never one and two in the standings they have to at least do one game better than Mortals and over a hundred thieves have a chance of getting any better move the tiebreaker scenarios afterwards so I mean that is tough for them that's what I think. Of the NLCS was talking about coming in and getting ready for the game was just like how does your four-time defending champion who only switch one player out I should have been probably an upgrade how are you still in the situation 16 games in and and you don't know what it's going to count them out until it actually happens when you miss 100 thieves to get 790 like yeah son at these results, you know whatever but here they can if they show us the level that they have over last year's but if they're showing at the level that they have a split I don't think it's reasonable to expect them to go to write like more reasonable expectation for a win is Asar second but it is a four-way tie for second right in their significantly behind first so it's kind of this mishmash between 2nd and 5th right and I think that is a chewable obviously flyquest could take them down also especially after how good Cloud 9 look today I mean they just dominated EG was been looking better than TL in recent weeks and you've got to beat them right C9 has basically taking every single team down in 30 minutes or in that one TSM lost that they had so she'll has their work cut out for them but people do still have that glimmer of hope because they know how good this team and look they know how good rocks that has been in the past individually and you you're just kind of thinking in the back your head if they can ever make it click like you know they should be able to then this is a really scary team and I think
for the postseason means that fourth place is important because of you finish the low for thin that 5th or 6 plus one loss in the postseason and you're out and so you really want to take advantage of that you knows quasi double-elimination and snag a top for a spot so big important for both of these squads of the hit Champion Select the eight and five flyquest against the seven seven Immortal for the calls are fifth and final game of the day thank you very much. You're welcome back to be Pastor desks plural I think is a lanai each have one and that's how it's going to work out here flyquest slated to go for in 200 to close out the season solo back in the mix that has every single roll accept a claim has been subbed out at some point this season so long is the first toppling sub busy or whatever else actually replacing the play than what they stop laying still it was the only topping replacement isn't she thinking Viper unfortunately has not been having the kind of year we were really hoping right yep he has had I think I'm pretty rough split overall he had had a couple impressive people are always going to look through his performance is because he's so damn good on that champion but his strong performances have been few and far between solo despite the fact that he hasn't been in the LCS was I think it's solid performer for a long time when you had from playing so I am interested what kind of level he is going to bring to your today against the dude that guy. There's something to the eye test with a K had a great Reuben game but you are a little into below-average top winter and yes record supports that again it supposed to go for a know they are probably death is a tie-break DSM at the end of the season and if it 1/3 best team and you have a 6 best top laner quite obviously a below-average performer still looking definitely do really well here I have high hopes for him I think he's a very good player I want to see how well he does it again snowy to his then I think overall it right point for immortals who are currently in playoffs session there currently a loan in 5th at 7 and 7 we'll see if they tie fly Emoji at 874 third orbit I have four five six seven eight that's the goal right try to move up and keep Pace with like West look towards that potential top for Myrtle says you say in a pretty good spot to eventually make playoff but they've got to close out these games has been criticism from their way about quality wins you do are all these winds really impressive one was it so deserve but at the end of the day I'm Mortals I think have been improving week-over-week I've been able to come together and make it work with a roster that people had very low expectations for coming into this with almost everyone had a mortal's 8 9 10. Time to test drive it and ends again I think they are looking fairly way out to your actually it's funny I am looking at what their last game against flyquest was which was their first game of the season Viper and Viper to longer on the team at least not starting right now as the Morgana coming through supposed to be running after shot doesn't get the extra armor Mr and you landed behind just like the guy it could be way more dangerous look for those engages as we're gone because not only can a black shield being caged but you are jumping in a straight line and the animation is long enough that you should always be able to hit the binding on the record and then this is locked him down to take him out Aqua is it very experienced work on a player really I think one of his best Champions we have seen him and follow in the past about Lamer United playing a lot of things like Caitlin Morgana as an answer to his Ira Khan so just a little bit different let's still the same kind of principle applies then also a cacique arthas band out once more so maybe kind of moving up the gears as far as the Sprint have been going because we stopped last game and out this Alfred mind at the T in both like what is physical heavy we know if you we can play a lot of stuff and it says hey you don't probably get to play a physical damage mid laner if we're getting rid of Tarth is here for the grass as far as I can tell it's still up there are still two magic damage sources if you really need it look there's the hover if not a big surprise there but yeah I kind of damage that you want so that's a relief Force different item purchases exactly it might as well if you're having a really good game you spell think me the jungle but you don't threaten the Hi-Health Frontline ER and that's why you need a consistent PP damaged or the Victor will give them just that I get the great year for the elite it is going to be blind so we'll see if I can grab something to try to abuse this matchup but a couple midlane dance I've already been thrown out by flight worried about in that Monday 1 to will be Casio end right. This is actually more of a Victor favorite matchup they both can scale the Victor outrageous and had severe Wayfair especially once you have the key laser upgraded you can poke a CEO from router for range with Yuri and look to kind of get control of the minion wave they're all right we'll see if it's going to work out as weak ass if he is going to hope the scale and and do well as when the more, jamming for Erica is third pick of the chance of evil I like composition I always liked set vairocana to get this very very strong overall lot of good things to do there. This is the only not Cloud 9 if he candidate may be Broken Blade that was kind of it as well but it was so obvious. How's the rest right he was almost dragonfly button the top three and I wonder if I could I would love their to be a real site for sex plays the end we no seen on can't be caught but I want to see that fly Quest. Send ballots so likely here and a solo just turn that knob a little bit more if I was it a little bit better as a team that's exciting I want you to do well like Wes looking even better they have been a pretty surprisingly strong teams are out this split I do like their composition a lot more as far as this draft is concerned I think Immortal really all kind of struggle they fall behind it all because they very poor ways to start a fight you're engaged is essentially a trundle pillar of Morgana finding which is not reliable where is on the other side like what desserts are started with more options to make things happen on the road pretty sure as is usual we take our 5-minute commercial break before the game starts hurting so we'll see you very soon but after this get the snacks good job keep it up keep it up I like your idioms hello everyone and welcome back to the show it is our fifth and final LCS game of the day I am still free that was still has a low but now it is League of Legends it's all you came here for anyway flyquest slated to be a top-three TV the end of the split I am looking forward to potential tiebreaker Theus m per second that's going to be exciting Immortals right now in playoff position and they can hold out of that with a win here they are tied for third I'll be huge for a mortal sin we talked about preseason expectations based on their roster on people think they won't really be able to match up there and have a big threat but they have been looking good Smithy I think this guy is so impressive how is he able to just succeed on all these different teams and no on Immortals when you're looking at the roster player by player it's shocking to think that have oral sex with a head of steam liquid his old Squad who replaced him in the playoff race like West on the other hand they to you know what have been doing very very well it started out incredibly hot cooled off a little bit but I'm excited to see are they going to be able to step it up even more his team with upgrades right like the lcf. Hardwick Smith he's no longer the first place but you know he he found some new teammates and he's a game-and-a-half ahead of Seattle right now true if you just had it replaced all four of them didn't replace him I like to hook up with you right now know Wheatley got better stuff on here is what the second most all-time LCS trophies right he's passed Pearson only SS and you know who his new old team making playoffs would be out for the squad I think that would be a very impressive run for Mortals I know that is what they are focused on that is what flyquest is focused on picking up every single win that they can you put themselves
but when he looks recently like that's not really true OG with pobelter is actually not on paper that week I think they're pretty good exactly what you owe it all to see how big can a can I think that's a very important note to make as we had in the Champions like to hear that pobelter recently added to BLD has been a spoiler senior in the last couple weeks of the split will see if they can Dash the hopes of another LCS team here in dignitas looking to make that late-season playoff push with first bands in the table let's hand it back over to freak and is out for the gamethank you for the welcome back to show I am still freaked here with his tail and I want a very first and reinforce the point made about is seals usually weaker than ticketops year c u l g with faux Beltre it's not great but they're too in for over those things fixed games the guitar * 1 + 5 sinful Beltre dignitas are we a week or dance plg not mathematically eliminated but the model right now shows the eight wins the playoff bar and see if she cannot get more than setI think it's pretty safe to say that he won't be making playoffs that are playing spoiler to take down TL last week or the craziest high life I've seen in a long time in the one V3 on Sandra has had some very impressive individual performances and I do think CLG is looking better with him and they claim that being said it's it stopped right because he came in pretty late and I do think both of these teams it feels like more it's focusing on improving and fixing things for summer and if you're looking at it through that point of view then CLG I think it's feeling in a much happierAirforce axillary not from the season opener for these seats with the biggest houses won the last match between the squad that was with proud of the mid lane worth pointing out is also back in the bottom of here for CLG as kind of figure out what to do with their season the shape up for summer that is more likely story line 10 steel G D good for the summer split dignitas meanwhile again pointed out that the statistical model has a twin B&B playoff cut off so they can toss The Mortals and TSM to play all of which are hard of pwnis the bottle has the only winning this game and that's it so do you want to see if this is able to turn around a b are in a Champion Select we get the Rumble that we expect who need a place and a knight Pantheon jungle 47 Grafton Ave in Katyshould be very interesting potential or even flextop Roni so there is some options but you're expecting who needs to be playing his Rumble which has been such a good fit for him over the years and historically me is really a strong Rumble player people off GPS the kind of for you in style hair for him go for it all right going to wait and see as they are trying to maximize flex but we know that Johnson is not going to play out of a pretty regular 80 carry here looking at his games play it's been exclusively pain medicine for players or basketball players this season 10 of the game going to grab their own support Nautilus MF definitely a very strong bottom line that's going to feel pretty comfortable overall ruin I know we can see or in the mid lane I just expect to be top almost every single time you're pretty happy to buy some like an Adaptive Helm is fine. Read that I demand you need permits can take it through so he's so fond of pretty standard team composition I think they probably just go for the Abyssal mask breast try to with Dan that maybe you go for the Adaptive it's really good in that one d one but because you're not getting that Free Horn upgrade on it you're missing out on so many stats against ever and also the team fight I do think that where it has the ability to withstand that match up and similar to how we've seen from bowl and win a lot of the games this season it's much more about the pressure in your lane pushing it in and then making things happen elsewhere end with this pic for the reason people feel so strong currently is that so much of the game is revolving around the usual ejected in the river and those are areas that are and we're actually incredibly important parts of the EGT Elwyn and around the corner there as well as for bands come through silence dropped the table Olaf gone here as well as I have since I was getting picked up more and more overtime W Max very low cool down lot of Healing Wings like an aggressively like the pantheon Rumble that was a champion who got to handle that pressure well there's also a couple good ultimate already for Silas to steal that any sort of potential filter in the mid lane hasn't played a non made so far this season as it would be new for him again only six game sample be here. But the team upgrades are stronger blade of the ruined King the real heavy-hitter and we're going to see a lot more of these Fighters. And mid to see what the field is going to be from pobelter cuz we have seen in, but not LCS is scrims that weak-ass last week before doing play the room King rush or going the Triforce until much later haven't seen that a lot or some Bill do I want to see what kind of a build he is going to bring out and we have to get the Fiora so this is looking now like Rumble mid you put that you're a Top Again see orange your I think was one of the biggest beneficiaries of a lollipop Lane changes ravenous Hydra something you love to rush the additional I feel there is very helpful and also if you can get access to Detroit flights your is one of the fastest if not the fastest heroic ehlers you worked on the turret the Eerie setting it works on the turret you can really destroy those turrets incredibly fast if you can get a winning cup encounter looking for where the mattress is going to be trying to find the correct one on ones I mentioned they think the groom can being better than Sauron I think I like the you're in the irrelevant be one as well just said that you can fairly easily riposte in the East and then fight from their wisdom here but looks like a champion to locked in at least Cooney and ruin are going to be playing those Fighters will see if they play mid or top themselves but the top laners have that matchup I do think it really has a chance I think as the game goes longer I can get more more difficult but even if you can. Post relia has some really good trading even witches the longer-range Autos you can do in laying in there are ways to wrap towel play that especially if you go for something like an early Executioner's rushed and be okay and that won't be one but I'm going to see if they want to try to follow the orange around the map or if they're just we have to play in that side land but either way ton of focus expected you around Fiora making the playoffs from the outside looking in Champions like is over that means there is a five-minute delay before we broadcast the game for competitive Integrity to see you here but after this hello everyone and welcome back to the show dignitas and kind of getting about to do battle here on the rift it's a tough one if that'll be 9th and 10th CLG almost assuredly cannot make plans for the guitar certainly can they have beatable opponents on pay-per-view to be something to beat CLG we'll see if they can make the push if he said if they can and we've got fewer births are really in the toppling Vista boot I think it's going to be a really fun game winner last I am so excited for this dignitas, a lot of style a lot of the you're a pic of having Pantheon jungle there's a lot of opportunity for the camp up on the top side and persisting in Split push cenarios which should make for a very exciting game and I will do this every single karthus jungle game a cast until there are changes I want to see how fast we can complete a first clear if you're if you're really really good you get it at just barely over 3 minutes like 3:03 or something in my testing first time doing it in a month or so I got them in at 3:06 so you know I want to see if LPS junglers can can clear as fast as me that's the real it's one of those things where there's actually a lot of little optimizations with how are you devising
I want to see better me jungle Synergy between just yell at last name that we saw from them yet we still for the week off on holistic did nothing in the early game acceptable to have season 3 and then for JJ's what time that was example of like I need to see the better team work out of the guys I really want to see to do date at the counter picks on red sign here in ASL mean that again and spend scam player on that sweet we are into Champion Select and we will be taking you through this job I'd ask you what you want to see but you already told me earlier that you wanted to send a band and we got ityeah down for that do you me Banos interesting in the case that it's more of a scaling pick at the moment but if she thinks they're going to be going late I'm not going to fall tonight I think I also need something is the orange it was I have abandoned in game 1 early in game 2 and up and and Game 3 it feels like we're still trying to figure out where to land on that but I think I can see how it makes more sense since they've relied on it so much and they're winds that if they maybe want to sneak one of those bushes farm and scale kind of when it's not allowed in this time the Affiliates will be B6 the band come through and that burst bey's and Varys of highest priority here for Team Liquid so likely in doublelist hands they are there indexing into their Superstar I think this could be a back-to-basics RAV4 TL dates and a lot of them at ades Bears Tom kench can be locked WD Sentinel I just don't know what to eat Ireland meet at this point Baris we'll win most match of the victim has not much you can do here for you she want the night at the music that's all I'm going to lose my faith has never been one for the Laney face he's about getting out of it BG all right quick couple lock-ins their Brom and mordekaiser for Team Liquid I think I'd like some mordekaiser so not not not the Ezreal or the MF how does that lame play out it was the kind of utility Marksman medal that you saw it on of this matchup I think even the same for you more range supports like diarrhea and stuff running around back in but ashes range lets her actually at the auto Advantage anvar so he has a little bit of this is a flying matchup usually for rash second phase of bands coming through first off the table will be recognized or some jungle targets here trying to knock broxah off-kilter a little bit so I think they know Genesis probably not playing physical damage midliner so they're going to just ban out as the ones of rock that is more likely to have a strong ganking impact on maybe Jarvan will come here and if they want to lease in or just a lease in here but maybe they think you won't be able to perform to follow so 1 Jungle 1 mid coming from Evil Geniuses Crumbs are you expecting that mordekaiser to go top link yeah I think you usually takes out with you like to send your man by EG ask him if they're going to Blind LeBlanc yeah I think the old block bench should go here right otherwise otherwise it would be a lot in scrims what is a smock I think the LeBlanc insta pic but leave could be a good denial basic do the best jungle juice and then what are you getting him to what then we're cuz I do. I've lost in his Jarvan Olaf said you wanting just wanting him and you want to give to do kid the account it's a Mark wanted to see what actually counters LeBlanc with Sandra off the table though yeah it just hasn't been played by either these guys all split so with a drop the table I can't run loves it so so good really taking their time do you like Lori on and play it's a LeBlanc just doesn't make sense for them here for Carrie there is it does go there and now what will be the response for gesu k he's got the reply is like the most the absolute most signature pick for him so he will pick that up and we'll have to see if that jungle mid do all that we've called out will actually step up to the plate for either team really I think that would be the challenge here spends Karen and just UK versus broxah and Jensen with the team comps locked in where do you guys fall on the chances of either of these teams EG yeah I like you leasing LeBlanc I think can do so much you're letting I think you can really let them have their way in the early to mid especially when you have Ashton level 6 you can do a ton in that 3 V 3 I can also CTL just having a massive feeling bandage so if that. Like if they're LeBlanc Lisa and doesn't pop off early I feel like TL what kind of have it saying that what my I want to see how easy it was more admit jungle Synergy this is the game to basically proved that you're that you may win condition you can stop most people in it and then you basically punch your ticket for playoffs almost if you can pick out someone up here cuz they're one of the team's truck flying to get in so this is a great statement game for easy if they can ride for both of these squads it looks like they've got what they want to see if they can pilot it to victory for crumbs he's looking for that aggressive early-mid jungle do a 40G to take down TLC Ellie got to hold on and play it into the lake and we are going to head to a quick 5-minute competitive Integrity break as as explained before we're taking this 5 minutes to allow the game to play ahead to make sure that we preserve any competitive Integrity issues to will see you on the other side of that five for the game hello everyone welcome back to the LCS IMDb preacher Lee the man across from me is Isaac as they are coming Bentley and we have LCS to play here today I'm excited to be back in Action spend you like for me yeah it's so nice to have I'll see us back some normalcy in our lives going on here amidst all this chaos and it's really important game 4 playoffs here yeah vs EG you'll need to win every like the three of their necks for at least they still have Cloud 9 coming up next week which is going to be a really tough one and if you're painting that has an expected loss they have to win every other game yeah I had our stats team put together a sort of predicted win-loss I Know Jack did his individual game predictions I had that's about to do the same thing and based on just would have eloped predictions TL ends the season at 7 and 11 in seventh place outside of playoff contention down the other side Emoji would go 10 and 8 going through in one overall Team Liquid results Wayzata showed us they are not a top-six team in the LCS they are 4 and 4 with Roxanne in the lineup you even dislike don't include his first week with jet lag they're still only three and three with him and that means they really do need to step up and have a better result of the end of the season with four games to go they really do it's this weird thing with TL because are the four-time champion back-to-back-to-back-to-back and kind of stuck in this world where it's like are you looking at what we expected from mammoths are and what we have seen from the past and saying okay they could still do it based off at or you looking purely at what they have shown us or this what because what they have shown us for this split has not been impressive what if they can get back to the Forum that they've had over the last 2 years and really start to work with process and of course everyone is possible before Roe is even possible as we've seen tons of those weeks over the past two years from Teen Wolf well we'll see if they've got what it takes for them being Evil Geniuses have been honestly a complete the light in how the edge of their season has gone 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 run that. He loved had in the last several weeks but it CG sitting at 7 wins their expected schedule is fairly easy stop but puts them as a 10 and 18 TL for being one of those expected winds based on Ehlo here and one of the other great performers here is just do cake who is a second place in First Blood league-wide behind only Dart off and went 8-1 and 14 last week but now I've got to get coming to the topside Spence hearing loss of turn that racket down a little bit again except the top side impact going to be slow and I believe is one difference he's going to let us an easy sonic wave as well first Blood Evil Genius is off to a great start and then make it look really easy getting a flash at impact taking him down very good start on that topside atrox looking to get ahead and in the middle and he does have the minion Advantage so just do cake cannot read too long this way but find a hold a bit of a breeze here in force Jensen to stick around on low mana and health and he's going to be a bit of a dangerous spot with Spence Karen in the area so process will come over try to help him safely reset this way if this is the barrier tax in a lot of cases you can still do this even if you do have teleported but if you do you know if you are stuck in a spot where your latest like this in your jugular can't come over often times you can take the reset then burn CT and get back in the lineup not a big problem with beer you are completely beholden to actually have and just the fact that Trundle show to make sure there was no gank means he was able to push that way valve but otherwise no one's been scaring his Top Lane that seems very easy to own one in most cases without having a good way out do you want to plan a milestone thank you for the Sir Arthur doublelift is a single kill away from 1500 regular season LCS skills I expect he'll get one at some point in this game somewhere down the line it's going to happen to watch out for that one you would hope that you would get one in this game kill or 4 Marksman play are at generally having a pretty bad game if you don't even pick up a single kill as a marksman who tend to get at least a couple I mean about seeing people who are getting kills I also want to give a lot of athletes Jensen here who I think it's actually been having one of his very best seasons he's got by far the best landing stats he has roughly as few days so I guess I facing the least depth of any Midland or in the league roughly type of pobelter who has even played all the games he's played all the games for first place as far as like least debt to your Jensen has been having an amazing year in the midline 40 yell one of his vast and remembers hearing from him back around the week to he was saying that he felt like he was doing everything that he could he was putting his best effort you was having a good season and it was frustrating that it wasn't enough for him I know to yell fans are a little bit sad about that I would love to see him turn around I'm not just saying this that teal pants can be sad and you know till like you know celebrate the downfall of TL I would love to see them back on top form Jensen is on top 4 Min the rest of team is going to keep up to this level I would say a lot of it has been about issues the team play issues in these things at times you're watching the individual player and send their looking okay it doesn't seem like that's a big issue is beautiful Ward hop in and that's going to be an ice pick up there but should be a trade is Brock to bring down the I smell it it's the one for an overall but it does mean that they slow walk back to Lima Jensen had to go Summoners I was just a great place soon as you took a hit 6 Jensen did not yet have level six there when he actually died so I couldn't turn around with the ultimate just now hit 6 afterwards and unfortunate for him is going to actually die with the way pushing to him thankfully though he has the S quite well so he's not going to be that far behind despite actually losing some of this in braxas way up in farmed Over Fence Karen will have the earlier level 6 got to pick up some of that midlane farm and you can see now this game state is 400 gold a part of the penis is having a pretty good start for your overall the elf not an incredibly great leading team just across the board they've I think with their jungles us everything else has had some really rough early games with sadistically this is not very far from average prevent and it's still been a decent record despite several early games that you can see yet but a lot of things are very very close of zi'tah plane is up at the river down to Jensen and yeah I think it brought that didn't actually block that though dented may have died and now the boss Thai 2 V 2 fight on free heavily EG favor Dash is a very strong later and despite the fact that we haven't seen much of her this year I do think it is a champion that can match up quite well against Bears yes she is very very good. Buster Lee recently as well better attack reset on cue things like this I want to point out very very like almost Pixel Perfect moves the right to yell core barely got in front of the arrow put the shield up took the stun he still could have block damage Republic but the fact of the matter is you still would rather
they are all easier than a breaker cuz they would be one one at the end of the pictures and then just look forward to that eventual playoff I was Cloud 9 with your assume he's all going to happen in this season so excited just back right. I'm surprised it's that wasn't first pick instead of talking to it Philly or take you like Spike West bands of Cinderella and xayah since there's a combined is a for no record by Bjork turn on Cinder and a V and O record for coffee on diet budyou're playing a dangerous game and every single player is going to hell for this ribbon is miserable in my head like anytime you start like prancing around in animation canceling that she's going to East on you and smack you four times in the face. Needed but you know what you'll take that it will get Broken Blade on his 10 three and twenty one set of the split totally Style on the NBA rosters against Immortal and then it's basically just been from a band after work which was also in Spain Rhythm player when he played in the TTL yeahI do Wonder like ribbon players no Riven matchup sir and a lot of times River gets banned because they're like wobble Viper knows this matchup still extremely well like I don't know if I want to chance it. I feel like the second the match of a problem this garbage but it also may be a little bit more Notch likely a Broken Blade wouldn't do this if you want to come here as we have matchups lines in the good things that are broken plate on this one be Lo Lem Estados 40s enflaquecer paleo thrash you want to find out a few times has has a very very low base that durability if you run it at all impressed by the way not a great protector you can just pop wild turtle that's why I so often you will see it scared was Hans Gunther from the to bet kind of paint protectors Treasures of is the third place like solving in third place I feel like just because of the power of the lanterns do it also allows ignored to be ignore in the mid game in terms of trying to find pic so I don't mind suspectit off like us band noises billionaire not quite sure what make the tea is them come pick and not know it was so good at being afraid of Liana for scary smart there is well we know it's so good as one of your ex's best champions of all time so okay for a lot of fans over at what are some piercing bands The Undefeated Sia and grog has an incredibly popular jungler is The Logical Choice here after they throw a few Jungle Band out TSMat least after yesterday just watch the violin Dish Nation in their team comps and I think they're doing the best of it now people keep hovering Zach I do think it's good and seemed a little bit I in Elsie and like a tiny little bit in OCS I know we start top link but it's a little weaker or so. I think we will see it one day I think that's very very likely here at Stefani's band that may be the next best tank, to pick up his single game so far this split. Start one game I can play there it is been torn out his first. Game of the split here first of the LCS I believeand regardless it's going to be an exciting one here is I think we'll have some fun and gay if you want to point out exactly the same as jungler snowing in about damage profiles and is also pretty cool cuz if they want to they can Flex this towards the toppling it's probably going to be playing on this Aurelio though it does mean that broadcast is there only a piece threat which will make it a little spooky if there can be some good Mr stacking coming true from the Zac cuz if you remember the last game flyquest play TSM it was in before and this was this was like an incredibly discuss game because GSM did Pantheon Thalia and then flyquest had just a bunch of stealing to head for in unitthousand gold at some point in the game but like what is so good in a 5ft 5in competition they just like stayed mid and I think this back and hips are Leo's and the Oriana are scaling picks for the flashlight do this is not as Extreme as it was before but it still is picking me up Tempo team comp and plaque was just looking to go lie and I'll see if I can do that right I know we're going to see if bury tankies back you might want to dust beer with it for a while cuz he wants to buy an armored Cavs versus the Teen comp but if Alice is very squishy and Stampy the Champions have back line access Broken Blade II hope this act in the back line that is going to reach the top and kind of exploded as well I would be afraid we're all totally sure we could definitely be attacked and end with one of them carries gone I think he's in Connecticut teen fights that way I did mention uptempo that got to be the one to or Proactivfind those pictures of this relation and we'll see if they can do it TSM coming off of win out the previously undefeated Cloud 9 black Westhoff an uncharacteristic lost a battle for second place on the line right now and to be completely honest with you freak I did not expect I don't think a lot of people really truly expected to be Club Mac and the year has been so up-and-down for TSM hasn't been like 2 of 0220 she was actually going to start 02314 turo they lost two in a row they want two in a row they lost two in a row and it almost looked like you were to lose for because no one expected to be caught and I know what are moving to 67 and then you're thinking hey the chi want to treat him lose you can they really be what was the rating for flyquest soap narrative flip the TSM could potentially make this week we're coming into week 7 it was if they don't beatcall Donna Flack what's the top two teams of League they would have been six and eight and maybe even outside the playoff picture with two weeks to go riding to kind of outperform now they have an opportunity to 20 this week against the two other best teams in the ALCS and really being that strong position tied for second with organs left and I'm not in the game I want to add more teams that hundred thieves before he ended their week 7 77th place if you some drops this right they be tied for third with a drop keys and I was he doing reasonably well but that's kind of the state of the standings where I'm third place is 50/50 essentially in the league right now based on results so you know Astra spending has game goes really pushing is almost every level one leading goal with Yabba the sniper damage and and the range on it so expecting to have the bush I really am making me pain to watch Philly fun games Raleigh the next year's differentlyChampions what yeah and as we talked about right at the end of Camp so I pledged his kind of reset what are expectations are coming into this game instead of softened him so often just for sick Tumblr side is he just wins these matchups against a truck because they can kind of handle it but this Lane position is very common because aatrox actually can't step up to set up look to see how much Broken Blade can win this Lane by that was greedy greedy since it's very difficult incredibly dangerous so then just Darda can't stop playing or does he try and move mid for this Duo potential of an Aralia stunlock into a rocket need to win the early game at some point so you need to keep your eyes on dark talk and also house and torn tries to slow him down for regen very, jungle tack if you don't know this one just dealing damagemonster turns on the hundred thousand which is like a few help per second per monster tag so I need to go to top HP as I get this easy on those because I'm worth nearby love that I'm going to keep within bakery close skin Farm but dark is faster the game lower overall champion musicals on future really interesting that it was fought it out so dark action to the start that didn't start at blubaugh it was just seen by Zachary try and convert them to it it's a start I like but I think we're going to see a jungle dual down by that blue bus going to be as my fight is coming over this going to the battle like I don't want to go to blow 500 cuz I don't know if the other person might have to walk across the map to get some more done but yeah that has has equalize the camp count for what it's worth Zac Jungle doesn't have a slower clearer than rocket necessarily he just has to work Inc tool so like any situation where santorin can just see training camp with our talk is a good tip to a 2% Torrance long as he's stopping Dart off from the deciding Lee what is the things to you as well as sleep these are two of the very best friend was the ALCS right now at 77% which blood percentage display was the number one player got it as well and he's like at 4 in like generic gold the early game stats Ben Torres number one is really getting bullied but he's out farming every opposing jungler across the league so far it's also is emblematic of the fireplace. I need was hoping for an opportunity Derek while Frost would have been aggressively with their Fork on again but didn't want to force too hard into the misfortune Misfortune definitely packs a punch really a little spooky to try and gain how much damage she does really on but so far mostly trading Farm back and forth total so far in a farm lease some of that is to expectation of Philly says good job early learning very good at last thing under threat you can keep yourself from dropping too much there early set Landing leave but there is a bigger way for my PIN to take as he started says backwards days out of the W Ranch No Bra Day is just a small hundred fans goalie for TSM across the Great Plains at the front with the word down at the Battle garlic to the jumps the way he hates want us to flinch has that could have walked past the shower and a half of 3 ft to Dustin out of rain for the floor as well and is it going to be enough to tell you. It is beautifully executed by TSM play through your strong Lane and that's what TSM does with a very strong leader in set and broken plates it almost looked like that was going to be stocked with Santorum got that to man's done but she had said was not to be deterred biggest clean house here to watch us have one more time Central us both and Gerson and delays this fight with me all day. We took her out of her Negros to the church doesn't warm up until here and then broken play blast Double Tree damage on top of your ultimate and it's just to wash the church I work and both kills go on you're acting so he can take that cold in his Midway match up that was nothing short of impressive I did not know that I was going to work but it work yet effortlessly we've been doing some dive rating segments on countdown 10 I want to see if one of the best rated we didn't write a chat it was one of the best I don't have the cars up here to Chicago lead of yet to get first Blood almost every single game. I can do that was just amazing now it's about pushing down it is, probably for a wild turtle but it's not like us to come back from an early deficit and what about that guy is are people heads just teleport back to link himself I think I passed over the pass aversion to TSM would have had this year didn't recall a match ups to be like oh yeah I just can't wait to get a few things back to lay like you're a jerk and she sees top way to make something happen GSM also now on the bottom side of the map that you can stop leak electric baseboard with the one up in the company. There's no Drake answer back.
today is very exciting as we talked about during countdown house away hundred thieves one is often like the way a mortal's has one so we could be in for a rather Wild game excited as you get around a victim because I knew that I should but right now the six wins is the fly off bar 6 wins as we're six places and these are two teams at that point right now hun disease that is very hit in this season so far to got to come back when I get stickers off yesterday and with the win over a mortal fear to a weekend since it's going to be a Hitman season so I can hit a lot to start and then they have been waiting for since that point right now I was wondering if there's going to be a step dad because I feel likeI am in which players have kind of stood the test of time and which one actually met with expectations right here to show the veteran status flight game wins have been really exciting vacations where are worse than LeagueI think that would be quite a statement game for him in terms of a cover fry almost wanting someone to stand out it's also a new strategy we're seeing here for the last week they actually put Apollo into para Taco Bell where they played most of the split with Altec and your kind of wondering whatever teams going to do after that often times it has been Ezreal with Kev plays to lose lean gracefully here most played in most punctual Champions all time so if you're looking to it's not the game one statement come back but coming in here at The Mortals running out of time to make that last final push before the game to speak they're looking pretty solid I will push on upward then I think I'll call it the definitely do that we got a chocolate toppingWillis played split it was actually picked away from him yesterday by Hootie and he ends up going Renekton but he's just looking to make this game wide open it it has been known as I want to say like with quotation mark a counter picks to aatrox but it's still very volatile nothing. I am date rocks which is why they try to still go off in like it well. So what else do you want to split post it was the reasons they stopped a lost streak when they beat to seal a meal for him so we'll be looking at so as looking at his watch the gate at the back line as well he's going to be so far the plan watch for me in this game I mean they're also pairing it was on level 11 basically has a goal so is this game does breaks down I think hundred thieves needs to do to be very diligent in these last two pics to make sure that they haveeither a very strong answer for Camille X Kenshin side or really reliable initiation so that when people do split a way they can just run down didn't win table sadly as well as Mortals are the ones who have banned away trundle I know we had the analysts talk about a Z-Wave trundle in and have that go well that's the bunch of us a map with multiple get first dibs on Champion texting we are usually expecting that to be done Google is it here in Corky trade banned from the 20 trade bands and go to the Pentagon supply store can I buy fish Rekha yeah I see the cinder already being banned a lot of time LeBlanc and be blind picture here it would generally fit with The Mortals hit and run strategy if it's company make it comfortable playingthat's the hover yep and locked in his first leblanc's game of the year going to play us lately different style it doesn't mean that they have a lot of fact Line-X I will come a point that one out in the back line the block and follow through there is queue does something over the top as well so I can definitely split and pick and 100 thieves is building towards us team of Team fighting who is Joey I'm not Super Soul Bond but there's also a lot off the table right now I think Garvin might be the younger that you want to go for Four Strong initiation Zach also is just stronger Jarvan play Jarvan but late-game big-time initiator back taxesplay seven games I can play season 2 this is what he goes to time and time and time again going to have sex or damage that down there and if in a truck funny but it does mean that you're relying on you know why they think a process for an outlet for your heart Broadway yai next if he ends up having old one but it does extremely well with over Blanc in terms of Ganga tip I find it interesting actually how generally speaking you do want a damaged difference in damage pipe between your jungler in the soul in your primary thank you for still like ragesh Joey isn't as great because of a walk had something like summer trades are Apaches field target has killed but this says hey he wants to go top way to gank for the eighth rock where is Smithy compositionally will actually pair with the LeBlanc and trying to Camp Midland so you trying to have that big game in midlane the jungler pics compliment that the year 4 x 53 fun to see if you can make it happen right here as time ticks down no surprises really in Tampa before it leaves on those flares Camille to me still a bit of a delay filthy a ton of her but that's always fun to beat regardless how to season the Mortal who is wearing off on the rip these off of win from yesterday but it was a tough one there early games has traditionally been very very weak but they found a ways back in 6 in 7 is roughly in Plymouth right now supposed to be in piloting The Mortals as well as elves I've done just as good of a job team's ability to have these late game situations where the game kind of starts losing structure and then they find their way on top what would be kind of fitting for this game is if it's just like a total slam stuff at all but like there's a lot of things that can break open this game there's High volatility Lanes on the side of a mortal so I'm looking forward to it rain. Fun game to watch we are on 800 portal search battles here five games play County in front of Thieves fix left for immortals and which were the teams of stacked up going tonight at 9 I feel like I'm going to get you in the playoffs now real quick yeah real quick it had to get some words from you nauseous after the game yesterday but going into a very important one because it seems to be understood that you need the 202 try make playoffs of thing do you agree with that has like every game at this point matters a lot to do with only five games remaining you know one game can always be the difference so we're putting our best into every single game individually and just you know striving for the store that considered considering there's a lot of back line by Potential from Immortals in this composition what are you leaning on most with a hundred things composition to try and go against that account I kind of like just hold his own well so as long as we learn it well around like preventing their flank I think we should be fine this game yeah I think you just elaborate on what you're saying is what we were saying a Champion Select where hundred thieves at a certain point in this game is just to be trying to group up and hold the zones well so they can move two objectives so they can move to a church so they can move to Baron and it's going to be about King painting show us in most of this game Sunday is it still safe enough as they fly around their respective cooldowns what damage goes back and forth is a cuz also fear the country right now against the real quick red to blue 450 Gracchus doing blue drops is going to stay longer but the one that was rescued from the bottom side it'll be bought Lane push 2400 Eastview level 2 coming very soon will see to get a double up hope just yet. So you might always trying to look at the wording Till There was a ward place that the Raptors so basically xmithie would be a little bit suspicious the progress will be trying something like stealing the Raptors but the fact that he hasn't shown as of yet people dresses for clearing blue side and they can probably surmise it it may be confirmed any second and he walked over records another Noah's he walks around he goes for his Red Bluff here so information gathered is meteos is finishing his side's the clearest half a can see right now we're supposed to take down the Wolves so I just really low impact early game by a small fee of Cleveland area slaying so that's being ways being pushed though so did you get most of it whenever I'm doing a clear liked videos. Before going off your boss is always the sense of relief when the other Junger hasn't gotten it yet but then you go by and we'll see what happens here quite land with anything but so as actually with the early topside push I really do enjoy things like that were you able to run down to the top river is. It's got a problem or not or if someone wants to go from self usually this early the Scuttle crab will definitely go over to the jungler he's really benefiting more from the bonus experience he gets from his jungle item for killing jungle camps really early on and you don't want your jungle have a level disadvantage this early cuz that can actually just egg left top laners being with one Creek offside level 480 is important chatous for getting physically bleaching at least the red very hard for you but at least we'll have to save in like 5 Seconds second time around so you know if you do that to me what are you doing 50 TV schedule for you okay he didn't steal it yeah well actually asked him if he does need to go up here with the wave looking towards him as still as if somebody wants to get this wave in and not have it frozen on him he's got to be risky that's what that word is for so immediately has to fall away and there's a good chance this way you could actually freeze if it goes aggressive as his jungers arriving so really good pulling up like the gravity of toppling anyways early doing the record player really can't expect that rush or the area transit bus was boarded without me being there either way like they always provide information like they do the horses are in the butt. I saw a really decent damage here he's thinking about trying to kill threat use your butt do I still have to get up some gold someday yeah so to have a hard time here live it looks like we'll have to see in a replace it looks like so as cancel the fatal auto hopefully we can slow down Landing for someday but so as did walk him down in Detroit what a close by I am excited as a little way if you don't get that about covers born I appreciate something going for it we'll see if it was mechanical display or not now that is Flash teleport is downloaded game can be even more disastrous for that lane that video so kind of sits up there to make sure that someday can get something to eat. He's already going to happen again yea threatened to fold I fear that works really fast jet okay go let's let's try and watch so as is auto attack so he lands a w he knows that you're so I'm guessing he gets dressed at a chart range and then still has thought the picture was going to kill so he was already backing away when he flashes and he can't get the next Auto off its the term Integra dropping that's Russo as off I think before his back with you he he missed the first Auto regardless I mean One auto to kill for sure because you were there and that is abandoned Sunday Augustine I still love you and a 20 ft Ashley didn't you know this game could be very chaotic snowballs Patrol I mean another solo kill for Sunday I think he's already among the lead League leaders in Solo killed a lot of people remember when he's solo killed impact 3 times in the atrox Gangplank matchup as the atrox earlier in the season the technically was a solo kill in the Top Lane just now so he's already up to one and look at that CVS discrepancy as well as getting to replace I mean how do you deal
hoping for playoffs you rent a cabin we do over the LCS there's no 12 and once you have the top and cops were only at 10 and 3 at number one right here I mean it go from 10 to 5 with us tonight Place Like These are fairly close together team TSM the cells with yellow busy at six and seven winds at these needs to the traffic on the bottom side right there and honestly could be fun to watch the Cubs play out pretty interesting Corky is the air I think not the most exciting how dare you in a little while it's back yeah it is dhokla it was always a strong GP player in the ALCS in and this is a guy who I think can make a lot out of his lady always going to have an interesting place down when he was playing with optic use very slippery focused and that was always something that they were able to play around so I'm giving this matchup if you can get to add this is an opportunity for TFM play heavily through sidelinesdo it honestly be fun to see him back on a high-performing game and he all right now forced to evacuate their runs out of the Jungle 80th and Layton beige good luck everybody can o'loughlin's relations but TL are coming back down by the way I look for verses 3 they do not have I could have stopped him to go to call Jake is here which he doesn't burn TP means we'll lose some XP review think of that you ran all the way down here now we have to run all the way back up they might not even get the blue book anyways I was going to like to come down to us might buy Powerball now moving the ball 7 the first wave so he has to sit there and take up the Farm is there pushing in TSM might find the sons are close to several cows One auto away shrimps are only two blue is like the reset here we're trading blows back and forth and I believe again there is an XP Delta now in the top side but I will rise early in Vedicjust now because after getting to his Red Bluff the walls are pretty much already cleared your picture and bars with your car will get little bit of the Head Start there and I obviously owe off to the faster than gragas so may not really amount to much but back and forth it does cost a summer off of both of the supports also worth noting worth noting it is actually, I believe it's definitely speaking if you're going to do so many rush and kind of word dependence on Courtney to be that consistency worth of damage as a mid-length obviously a marksman as well but it's going to be doing that again so I can take that much threat permit in a long form team fight to be gone the next camp and as you mentioned you off really fast we are very Auto Tech Vapes super it needs to man up but I'll let you know what the blue bus going to feel pretty safeso off they go to next pieces and everything else you too we just get sacked and they now see each other let me know where is because then it's going to make sure if I feel pretty big clearing that fell on the bottom side probably speaker with know how dangerous to go down there either way but definitely don't want to run into a walk in the jungle play Spragga sent you with shrimp I actually read sitting here after that boat's I clear because going to be able to deal with the homies can't see will get the rapper and cook it is it go from work because he has another charge of might have bailable Don't Care Bar could be in for a little bit of work here if he does run into him and leave the last check with his barn in does is there sure you're denied his own Red Bluff but will be hit big trucks go to invade to Camp lead to them being steals you Stewie deal because this means for Empire guess you can eventually clear out these grubs but there's less total came to clear because basis he has a better by if you do get a chili pie and he comes out with three camps to clear where it's now turn fire will finish this up and really not have a lot to do is going to be able to try to look for it but that's also kind of covered by what they got done with this in baby another Ward you all the angles that share in fire could look towards to gank or colored something from to do the top side of the first evolved who is running away and he's going to be fine he's the ward can't kill it because it's Too Faced X that is 6 Q not Landing or maybe Ron burns the flash thankfully it does turn fire bought way it is around you never walk away by the flashlights jungle on both sides that are not the best thing to avoid this slow but still got tagged by the barrel so kind of feeling on two accounts there and does allow shernfire to limp away and what could have been the first what is still going to be taken away and if you wait in the camps are sponsoring bars back his bottom side of the map does going to have a chance at Absolute secrecy the party he did that really first recall for boots that he could start using predator and as tactical CZ comes down 10 they focus cow with the extra clothes Here Comes The Front Climbing a pole and Askew and the exhaust SoCal when will he bring the Flash's actor and he just really thick skin spots the Gangplank old almost kill will not come through the breach very very low but all the supports walkaway expensive on both sides it wasn't gplc so that it's going to be more careful in that don't have that to bail yourself out of could go in chicken Saveur are leaving overall but perhaps you were thinking hey I'm going to have more of the same in the long run and utilizing the fleet footwork and you know maybe if we sprayed like this I guess I feel back up and then take control of the lane county that does end up being the case higher region on the Corky so I can see the address of trade close at all it does work out long-term midterm for you nice pull back of damage can take it so quick as you know why that I'm grasping is a pendulum with it whatever but I do think that if you're going to take that for her plate. How would you rather have you want to have that feeling on you being the fact that you can go call you know and be able to scale happily towards the triforces to be feeling really really good of course you can make big plays on the side of me we saw it earlier today Broken Blade actually tell her she's taking over that TSM game on the deck so I don't have to be super worried but I think all things considered guess I'm going pretty happy with what's happening in the top left-hand for tactical off of recalling and that is going to be Lee palette iberus coming through of course the in about a year ago a ton of Great Valley I just got out of the shop so I can know you can see that build work out pretty nicely and the Tom catch can resuscitate someone if it does come through so I really am curious how this concert going to line up and deal. We'll work well rocket Holcomb forky alongside the fairest if someone gets low you harden Gatewood gragas I feel like it's very likely to get them finished that kill UPS no flash so I'm going to be on your side with that one blank Bud we will have to find out what is going on some level of security issues here today are you and I actually couldn't watch the Champion Select earlier on so we got kicked out during it but you don't have to wait then coming out with nowhere to go he's going to die in the first place for speaker I was just waiting because you committed so hard for there to be like a cow gets turned into a burger or something there is no fun that is beneath you that is true I was caught I was bluffing and I hope you wouldn't call it Edmond you called it I did if you were someone else with my first day in around each other makes them rich and hey Drake comes over too well filem I know that's scary I was nice those bad things for me for you all right employ the same job for 10 years 5-7 is up your way you know this is all right side by Nicki Jenkins is going to be going for the trip play he's able to grab it so he's having pressure in this matchup and they're probably has been cutting pressure there is a game of all that is touring with an old deck can't land and there was no way out speakers and thank you for the leash by jungle take me down pretty easily there let's watch this one more time this has to be picked on how this is something that is simple but often times over looking for his return to where you for Summoners is the way the frustration to be when you see when they never regained for Bashas up this time they come back they kill off now knowing you didn't have a summers no way to get out once he's still have the mobility on Tom casso the good punished from them and speak picked up another going topside now out to that 200 start on Oahu wants to be playing for my head because this is really a one-dimensional champion at them and you win or you lose your head you win more than you don't know when the time is always dead I feel like you say I asked you and Matt will it down one way or the other. The end of regardless lost is still feeling comfortable has a hundred gold assist to make him happy and we've got a saw with 600 goals lead for TSM liquid though I've been a consistently strong team ever since this roster came together with their intended starting jungler 6 and 1 which is true but can make it 7 but dies I've been doing very well so glad you're on the top side hasn't seen out and really a most you few lines with Yoshi Asian fusion Freehold you have been slammed before that actually probably as well as preaching the power you have in those barrels to actually make it very easy to scratch the back line the end and start to really pick up on that passive what you would like to get bored pretty quickly at your door at grow and just be purchased that just went out to eat in casket out of current rain total in the wall and don't want to go to help for all of it to him in a Flash go away the flash to follow and Team Liquid find a sweet guy with the topless yeah they are able to knock him down working with even on the Rhone there to back him up he's going to get his and her two lost from you whatsoever The Elf on the Shelf a great dive on that top side able to punish do puffer really the first time this game I really like every piece of that dive right there so and Shelly over the wall once you take Sacro I'm just going to walk at you from behind and there is no way you dodged his body plan really really nicely done he was going to head up with executed Team Liquid Fire back in the lineup looking to make it another wind picked up and they've gotten the game a lot closer to go to fart but TSM don't have that first break I wonder if I just ran straight down and it's a pretty thought that was George Strait at the dragon and then try to flash the cat basically it is it is far right but maybe a better chance that Haymaker you see so many players flashing that line and still get back by the end of it though listo 40th I'm not losing hole turret so that is still up for grabs here now again I find the top and side for shrimp are us a flat surface will not let him go speakers aggressive several camps and now with the clouds race just about to spawn TSN feeling pretty sure if I was going to make you feel really really good that's kind of the biggest play making tool that TLA do have to have to be able to get access to people like the MF and like this is there they want to you like that and dragon flash or treating at your house before that has a lot of going to feel good they are trying to give respect go to the back of her door was locked and the package is available for you to eat those kids they need to be gathered up and looks like you're going to be happy to just try to trade it for a plate or two of them at top five but Deca test grouping up in the bottom River cloudraker coupon for them to go to the ocean here lots of tiny fruit do they have a pretty strong, at this point in the game you know Emma have a lot of ways I feel like directly into this drama get double Marksman and usually pretty thing that made me to feel like they really need to be Olaf also be down as well and I believe he has done it's okay we can wait a little bit of this one will see if the scale pretty well and one Dragon really not a big deal but usually you see any Olaf from ahead and wants to fight early because you are much weaker and weaker than later they know they have the ability Center.
you double-crossed the boy and I think he makes a really good point in this is something you have to take into consideration both for him and spent there is that when you are on a better performing team you don't always have to do as risky as a flag which can sometimes you know turn out really early because you have more faith that your teenager going to carry you were going to make things happen and then. Maybe not having as much faith that they can play all the games in the same way that he would be able to do players fitting different roles right now but the ribbon respect given up here has been a fairly middling to to lower end topless hey you're with one band cool, said there was no time right that it says they have room Banna got them 75% of the time that is the most banned Champion against black West the next most man is actually grumbled at 42% so you're this guy just being on your team changes Piccadillymanaging of itself and that's kind of the point that fix over there so we are sitting on 6th wind 679 probably the most important thing Santa is kind of is the current has the coin where you are starting visit before item you're not actually farming the thing that is most interesting about it because we've seen a lot of different variations now around the world with Steve Rumble we have beads become more standard tanks or through using volibear Nautilus likely going to be the answer here I wanted you can do as the Nautilus alongside is fasting Santa is actually go AP Nautilus because you have more gold you can actually feel toward those items and we did actually see I think it was ignore play that kind of AP Nautilus style last week or the week before with it I think I wanna go on damage that it is not really a damaged. You put that some man and you're lying and azukita by the way is not looking for mates player he's the guy he's one is going to the bush I think that would be a bad cough for EEG for me so I'm kind of guessing you guys are don't really have a fun time Warren sometimes can be detected that rule because you have so much for looking damage with a little frog butt I am expecting that support Gen 4 ignore is the guy who is Ben still creative I really think as me to really big difference unique Championship played in this poor role so that's pretty cool too often and breakfast it feels like it is not really getting a lot done most of the time it's kind of even or behind in lane and barely able to find a lot of success in teamfights it's one of those things I think it's almost from talking with a lot of pro player its people are having their their opinions show shaped by scrims for the Champions where it really succeed in these kind of Scrappy game for fighting constantly improve play where people are more willing to kind of be more defensive and go down a couple of his often it's rarely finding as much access so you'll do well on it strong work ethic in purlear in the split but it just hasn't been a champion that I really seem to be very successful overall or at least call a doctor gets diapers are these two are here as well for himself by Band the pigs become a little bit less obvious will get locked in but already Nautilus Plus Pantheon a lot of geckos that since they're pretty powerful as far as when you're looking at Cross that place I would think that is so strong with that so what's that you're looking for these Global flavors in a consistent across the map and really make things happen and we have many sets of cops come in a couple times to get them know who played it a few weeks back good for the early game because you have to get into the back line you can't just like front or back on a slow gameplay it's happy on you need to be getting planks you need to be working really well at least court date in the gauges coming to be excited if they can let's go the charm should be blue how the pantheon stun Ms. I believe I got Reata couple years ago so who survived the matchup remember though it this could be deleted or Camptown is still don't know this is completely flexible I'm going to assume that they will sit on this to leave it does have pretty good Wayfair it is not as good at it happen at some time in the past I've got nerve quite a while ago and Ari is someone who you would expect to win that one do you want do if you can actually attacked the one the one keep the Aaliyah Lockton Lane you're moving a lot of her power to move around the map and try to make Plays with Stampy on 4th hasballah bust in 10.5 out of jungle is viable right now and it's really trying to do some funky phucstyx stuff for 35 HP you're not like anyone here but maybe next week tacky the re because it's done right into that seismic shove combo from Thalia and zero type damage can be arranged for that Pantheon to execute happen if we get ourselves into the game last I'll see if they would I say to know Academy Showcase in afterwards you got her number two team in the league flyquest is hear the Baked Bear market yet a 1/2 an evil genius his just outside of fly off but they can keep up with hundred seeds if they can pick up a win here been kind of loving the two teams banter back and forth on social media as well can fly Quest obviously go green initiative planting trees for victories EGT other socially to say they had cutting down a tree like that for book so they're both doing things for charity but kind of in their own ways which has been pretty fun to see them go back for it Lumberjacks be they can make it happen people he's so close to me this is actually the delay play either way for talk but they can play this is him being rude I was going down very bad spot Gangstar a bank or just for the gold that one with the? Being so this is this is actually a path we've seen before and and what are you trying to do you actually gone over this wall you come to this bush and you wait right there and then you try to invade behind that person but because they did so late in the game and because that's the entrance is almost always guarded by multiple people around you see that play made actually on top side but this is what it says about laying in bed where Greg is wash and we'll go over that wall wait for the cooldown then wrap around behind but it's a lot restaurant at bottom side is lot more members in the area and yes there was some unlucky timing is bandwidth walking right by as it happened so unfortunate start the air fan go to get to start with first blood will be pretty happy about that one small benefit for flyquest though is that thang and actually get to spend any of that gold Yakety Sax expected starting item set up here so it won't matter for the landing phase itself in foreign it would be easy to read to any blue and he's not going for a beer and something else is worth pointing out I always feel like I just I just find him and he's on there can be very effective against you going to have these slow Auto attacks like Senna also like gin know where it's about individual power off powerful I do a text instead of necessarily you know if constant dream of GPS so listen to track how ignorant does use that as it really can turn around a lot of all into the unit to find a hook on Turtle if the initial round of attacks from bank that's actually carried out by the sin that can really takes it gets level up at the camp was gone but if we three cancer red frosted his own walk to free up a Spencer and invade and that does do little something but it still needs a spanking to take a pot of scuttle if he will get the scuttlebutt they have pot lamb fries who's probably going to get it anyway looks like now to do if they weren't able to take away everything on the bottom side of filtrate goes off on topside so go to be pretty happy about that all things considered it is cleanse for power of evil says kind of just giving it back over to that combo that you can say 10 in French do with that Big John's done you kind of need to be able to cleanse at to dodge out from the inevitable seismic show that would be coming to Colorado if you're going to come through probably goes back to when I do to get more of that died for more that trade I should say is the way for us pushing towards labor so why don't you do as he has won all across the walls to chicken but he's keeping up with the Farm Bureau see if they can find any sort of angle to get to set up feels like it be a little bit obvious we just write it runs up but here we go not enough, survive running Flash The Flash The Flash The Flash felt like he might have had lethal damage they're actually do look for it and now it's is UK missing it's asking to be flyquest following they have to pack it up but they can actually re-entered wait around anyway nothing else that's the way it gets thinned out to say okay not enough time to die properly out we go to start and actually you're not comparing the Senate who is going to be playing at the board I done so already 10 plus the s in the advantage going to feeling pretty good about that and it does bring you much more of a true tank in that my mind because you normally look at this in a while you don't have to change and usually the detective work on a horse to do tanks that really rely upon having that stone play active and outside of that they're pretty squishy to be able to build a full tank items and largely I've been seeing what it is he thinks it worth playing along cuz that's antenna it's just a rush to word things like that man quite effective right now bank is able to feel pretty comfortable I got to point out of court GS400 Freeholder first blood but even subtracting that subtracting First Blood Billy's film 100 / ignore that we've been very efficient and using that Sickle and Demetropolis going towards but I'm assuming it's a very standard build of umbral glaze first that you're going to get that site so you going to be a complete an awesome board killer and still sleep Valatie but you can deal with these damn yeah there's just so much utility on that item not only revealing the word for allowing you to one hit them is actually a really big deal especially on that night we got slow all the way back or like how long they refill those texts were stolen Epsom salt as wild things are so predictable that helps friend Karen's favorite Auto attack knocks down the honey fruit good jobs for the pal what a bow with a buddy with a guy that's enough out of you all right you're on time out OK cell power evil pushing this one in just do cake going to be running back to laying here he has hit 6 and I have to start worrying about as you Kane Brown even more anytime he is off Vision you have to worry about the potential for Sally assault in obviously spent Caron still pretty far away from 6th and black on both sides could be looking to find the charm there's potential for that follow up from Sanborn and lethal damage but you'd have to be willing to either commit your flasher ultimate to start the fight often not even sure if they are still here yeah they're going to go to the flash charm to follow that up with all that lands he's just gone and this is a really good example of how to play around what was is attacking this level we actually saw this done excellently by to get them earlier today against C9 where you want to go for a shed great we're just going to be in Shands late you can tell to go to self so you're not going to be able to help yourself out in that way yourself will be fun to see if he if he does look for any sort of plays with that playing out of vision hear this was a lot of patients were flyquest actually was waiting for ignore to show up and then a three-man collapse been spotted they know he can't respond to this so last on its that charm connects the key was guaranteed would have had
carb lunch right now to change whatever the hell you want to make things better be there over in the New Wealth as a team setting to Champions like that's my cue to had it back over to our Brilliance pastors gentleman for horses not quite that record but so far I go wind in four sticks a sure I can accept that logic but look at the Academy games when does play take over there his stats are fun6 days there is no thing that I can look at it healthy wind is a better player than six I eat around 3713 instrument a meeting point better there there are other behind-the-scenes and maybe the ability to really step up and become a great player for this organization if we give him space time and we allow me to Bellefonte sell BLTs Squad then maybe that makes sense because they're not going to be credibly unlikely for them to be able to do that very well could be Wonder earlier today Top Lane Champs definitely stop playingspell thieves as you going to heal the crap out of receipt yeah it's actually in a free spells that are on the live now this was the highest win rate oplinger in and buy a lot early overpower her way without actually going into the penalties for selfies you pick up a couple of minutes for weight gain range for experienced you harass and Brock selfies on cool down and then you just become a ton of goals and Hannah levels and can really support your team come t five time when you're playing at the big like a norn or I can't just win the game through cycling is Jana you know so with that walked in I do think it makes sense as a pic and I am assuming it's going to be tough for secluded who played standard in support role but it's one of those things we're generally I think the best strategy against detective off rerun the support officewhat is a slow cooker and give him back some type of Flip or Champion which they probably won't play making as well so for sure top yeah and it's looking pretty hyped by I do think that this fun I'm I am always happy to see teams grow out stuff and try it out when we had if you watch this morning or evening if you're over in Europe or any other for the times I need two of us but what are there x o x i c the champagne was absurdly Opie and so love you in as like well I should just try even though it's going to get there pretty soon this was a good pick for it so I went with it and it's not going to work next week I will try this out I will innovate I will play the new thing I respected of a player I'm happyyou will make even more sense if you're as guilty situation in your 2 and 10 right swing for the fences a bit here you are not expected to be TLC love 1/4 of their last five although they are 6 and 6 and there aren't of a High Street they dominated last weekend only had one death between two games of them is. Like that so I respect taking a swing here and saying hey maybe this is not so we're going to do every week but this could get us a win over Seattle and nose keep us in the running rocks and keep you under 3 days ago and you give him the past three wins fight for them as you mentioned for the last five it has been looking better and mid laner gets picked they are interesting but they will make sure they give me the confidence before they lock him and that always tells me you have a I have something that I thinkgood if their composition allowed for it do you want to be able to see what your plans are going to run and intake based on that I do think when you're running a high damage so it could be something along the lines of are you considering you know Olaf reconsidering maybe mckendra drag race or something like that I can scale well and be another kind of for sporty but I will say it's pretty damn low on a beach right now yes there is some ability to pay post a private some old are the threshold or detector thing it does not eat Street the back line carries the Victor in the MF right when you come to teamfight I'm at 49 brommer sending ahead you can't do this does improve your ability to actually land books as well Scout of the week with consistency you throw down the pillar the a we slowed their place with a pop-up gives you a chance to follow up on that also help them to shredBrew at the front line is not traditionally built as kind of a damaged carry easy LPS yes it is effectively no giving you the same sort of idea right it's making the tank squishier and turn off the feeling that same role gigantic damage am through your entire maybe you knocked on the orne fast enough the Bramble kind of may have stolen plate for the majority of the game does look pretty good for is vog hear the facts I should be safe there. You could carry I'm also really interested in the bottom line here because I do think we did have a competition we have to have a good game if you get slammed in laying you don't have a vagina is there could take that strong. Make them even stronger last time they thought it was 6 a.m. doublelift in the bottom line so completely different what TL absolutely slammed CLT doublelift and chords JJ got they were dominant and feels she is going to have a strong lady performance gearand smoothie if they want this company for workout Envy and we're going to see how much work can be done are in playoff position we note Op 2 is what you are fighting for and flyquest and DSM are in Striking Distance for the TLC Squad counter logic gaming not out but certainly move their way back up I can make it pop sticks they are Four Winds behind fix place right now with only a few games to play 6 to go a real quick chat back and forth about dodo things guys do do EC tactical oh my goodness oh and he's out there we go okay well there was a man of the hour right there taxi k'lon survived me invade but just asking decision-making for continuing to keep him in this week despite devilish for covering up so we used Costco last week and we're pretty great week and the team in general played really well around by the doors are the things that I was bringing to the team competitive voice so we don't wanted to see more of him with a team and you know we wanted to make sure we can have a better decision is going into the rest of the split with the strongest roster I'm sure he's excited to prove himself in the fans are excited to see him play DotA thank you and back to you guys give me the Depo owner of Li Shang his team award and becoming a list of the first four minutes of game I almost I cursed him out of his death list that it's always fun to do it looks like a spotted on the Redbox today start Wiggly going to leashless hear the most part I believe maybe ruin a little bit against the donut she really intelligent you put Warren did where you can just brush a Bissell and actually be going to completely fine against in dress so that's no longer dangerous match up there you put Victor top where does a Range vs Reigns match app that can actually win out against this Jonathan Warren is not going to have the ability to take down the John it gives you a free Lane to actually proc spell thieves constantly any time you were going to practice golf tees in a Range match up as as Jonah when your gas detector you were going to be getting traded back on so it's actually a lot harder to keep up with gold efficiency of that I didn't have it on cool down the whole time you can just get bullied out in straight up a lose this one do you want one for the back the sun comes down to one for one of them mentioned first logo dirty liquid-filled does get first what I like to play from tlg very aggressive they had level one still on both those TL bot laners able to do a very well-timed I fear this was just a red to blue straight to bought Rome down here from pobelter and they go for it for tax analyst position pretty well they get the Braum's done over on to win he did get Auto buy for JJ and pack those able to brought that allowing them to take him down and get first Blood before he does ball should have just waited for me to call Akron the first place that does not have teleport get the taste of blood damage but getting back to Wednesday heart exactly so this is why you're not playing no see if that happens but every dank like this where you even just gets jumped out but you survived is way more punishment because you don't have control over what is right and know this match-up is going to become much more difficult for ruin anytime he's getting jumped out he's going to lose control do Jensen right now is trying to deny a lot of these minions and not even going back to work around and put Kelly's tp2 top of a now fighting the bottom size 3 B2 down here some of the most we got going to find that stone on a threat about us going to keep sending me forward it smoothie finds the killing and they have to have the Catskills kt82 deaths in the first couple minutes after having a deathless weekend Joshua Smith so there she just going to try two lanes blocked ear off and then he could even a match that lane swapping just going to continue to do this because so far ruin has been having a lot of trouble in that matchup against with Victor and I see no reason that they shouldn't just going to try to maintain those Lands End swap around know how have Jensen bass have in fact try to push this out but growth is one more time weekly waiting out of range that wart is bought and now movie do lashes in 5 when's the hook they're onto tactical who did not have his flash I do think maybe before they could have just make that book and allows axle kind of just get out of there he left his life instead but it is hard to say. Equations where maybe for two days that he paid well I can dodge it if you can judge it to then neither of us have to use Summoner and we get out for free but either way it does mean tactical Dale's down one more time and he's very far down in farm lucky he got that first Blood because otherwise it would have been pretty bad and cl does just linked to operate back and now it's going to be really coming here because room wants to get out he's just going to try to link up again is going to become the shuffle back and forth that is why you're calling your jungle gear not to try to gag when to say help me pushing this way so I can leave I don't want to lean against the Victor got an Isis you know if you're going to hit the nocs penalties did she goes to hard boil so so yeah you know hey congratulations also means they shut down the gaming leopard I've being baby questionable because conjugating face be tied and gold upset Drake and they'll see when you're looking at these to be gentle with your gold is caused by the fact that it's 48 219a when you're comparing the picture to him down like three hundred gold important that you get the experience and that's where I'm a little bit more concerned because we're just hit Level 5 has been sick for a bit so he is holding pretty far behind is the cost of trying to lanes while back and forth constantly and trying to dodge this lame is that if reported has link control when you do that you are missing minions in your missing experience and Route again is just running away from Victor then through this whole game so he is falling down in the experience do y'all have very well scaling So lyrics not as though there for depend upon that really getting thicker and order free Lane that has a cost to rent a Bentley play together by the way it's are you appointment in the game so if he has a 1/3 of his golden camera from Minions I supposed to go camping he will take - 10 code for Minion are you so so that's fine so far but keep potentially dive Jensen to withdraw secure both of us it could be risky I wouldn't mind Jensen just salting the wave safety that there's nobody had and look at that satisfying death ray Autos the last one in 65
basically here at EG that are undefeated undefeated team in sure there's more to play but whatever by far the worst team in the league base with HO2 skillshare Kobe it's been tragic for black was so far it's been a really really rough ER Altima supposed to roster still around navigate for you free most played Champions we'll see what the last band is beer from Geniuses maybe they continue to whittle down to Leah and Natalie already taken off so either or Graves left hanging we don't see on the graphic either way they'll Olaf is 2 / highly prized absolutely. I do still prefer graves vs Olaf again even though are there been a lot of losses for the grade vs Olaf and Elsa gay at an opl because and with good level one planning you can get the grave. So very very good start and you can try and abused the the reins backed up it is one of the few as you're stating that you know against a lock that I would actually like to Pilot prefer to be on the on that grave site progress I think right now it's so flexible you can play him in almost every position but we haven't seen it as carry bottomlands but it out I think it would work out okay just the PC Larry gets pretty reasonable but otherwise I agree let's not go for that one but yeah 83 does not have natural Escape because if there is even far from Ian to our space is so many times but obviously I assist you with that so I could think of maybe something like like delete Liotta also does no ad on top of your eyes I like the cop in itself of grass players try to play that one outs but we shall see already been coming through right now topland are going out to table also dropped off as well which is always tough because you know it is the nerve and cut the grass at the Alex Orban going to do anything if I could just put in the sport roll to see that one will have to Blind there benefits to figure out where the grass is going before they lock it in both solos I mean I was just kind of can't cuz jungle in a locked but dropped off so they're going to put a different brackets most likely is not a bit later to the lake well if he's going pop then you can't you can't play games like good enough for us and I feel like a lot of possibilities and text Doug over and over for EG rejected rejected rejected he is very good at playing at tank so the ORD is picked up that not going to win the lane like he was doing with the Renekton abilities are still really good teleport ways really good wife for him so those same kind of therapy go through three as well either the bottling place or in mid wait to see you later either way she's mostly played as a hard support down there exactly sure they do need a real top I mean there's still a chance it's practice before Saturday me to call the top or theirs. I'm going to say the most likely is Gamora is obvious one of the Dragons. Fairfield before I really think that he's been playing Super well way better than after the bank and he talks about really loving this new team last year did it feel like they were coordinated and if so how this continues to manifest a squad of players continues to grow because he can without remote leaf and it's the all right if the cops are locked it still shots really care about minions in the way so she should be able to play outside of Hope distance is always keep them in middle and end of the forest the opposing Sports have like walk through a like Make It Rain or like the Serafini slow and distribute really easy heart Bush Lane with a lot of control I actually love this combination even though I don't play a lot of bottom land this is one of the super easy to execute super long-range went because Sarah has such long range with harassment and Misfortune make it rain this past you know where your marker is saying like it is very easy to single out someone off in the in the lane and hit them with both of these just big chunks very very safe as long as you don't get hit by school shots and are you can hide behind minions and watch out for the Flash plays in and jungle place from thresh but otherwise the long-range harassment is insane from that duo is because Misfortune has a slow on the kids if their slopes every year upgrade into a route if they're ordered it from sarafi surfeasy to upgrade into a full stun so misfortunate actually provides an extra layer of ground control to Serafina in Cabo. In the ultimate that's like three four seconds of Hearts PC which means the NFL is pure start MF to try to spam that's not going to surprise you very much either Guardian for seraphine is outstanding because it will shield herself as well which means her W will heal it would have just killed a lot of really good choices here in this convo is that the Make It Rain is instant so you'll see good combos who have played this play with my friend you can cast your GE and then Misfortune also can cast reflux mostly at the same time it'll land it then gives credit for the slow for the for the snare and it's just really really hard for your opponent's to react to good to lay in bed here they they want to make use of that level one priority see if they actually even leave behind they were there we go. Does it delaying a little bit longer so that it will last a little bit longer 108 into the game like this more so than the brush by the blue oyster going to go in Reinventing the steel blue anyone else was hitting up in that brush you just want to see if they're doing like in case you lose track of somehow the dump in a fog like this is just the word you want to go for they're going to go get ya Pastor Flash in time to get away from the rest of this go from bad to worse Open Arms by the entire 5 man squad of eegee's Stephan stays around to say what's up oh my goodness all right so I love going for this power-play you do you have a crazy level wide bottom playing with the seraphim Misfortune that we're talking about and Olaf like that is it should be able to get a pic and should be able to fully out any even numbers match up that you find however this is not even numbers surprise surprise a blast coat over the entire team of EG turns it around they kill Jose no flash on the Olaf either and remember freaking Chef Select when I'm talking about liking the graveside of this matchup and it depending a lot on the start guess what ideal face wash Grey's with flash advantage over Olaf get the power Farm earlier because Jose died a little bit quicker there oh my goodness this is this is so nice to have been scaring okay so yeah you start obviously song Little Eva lamps up because it's been an exciting start of the game already Palafox to use out pictures I'm going to come up Wednesday for Johnston with the Teeter it's not quite infinite Mana it's like before you got into your feels like an infinite but really good lot of pressure down here you can see the goal is to have been pushed in and the farm is coming soon but you can get a lot of damage here if you haven't got a standstill to get my pictures I got to go for an early. And just like that I'm here I'm here and by the way here's a route years of starting a lot of damage and it's just cold and very beautiful play. Works out now for EG they moved them off of the minion way they do things a lot of experience lost their and because licorice got a really nice Chunk on to deathly right before the arrival of Decay that match even with the zucc a-coming there's no turning around they can't be punished for this aggressive strain behind the tower they have no health bars with which to do it so it's a lot of Defense there from Evil Geniuses and it results in teleport advantage and a rotation here from Palafox I like this play look at the ACs difference here cuz if they went down to the bottom you're good at you're going to miss out because of how fast does the entire wave into mid then rotates the top four that waive your akali gets the dream scenario going to get to level 6 without any effort at all and this is perfect because I was talking to Palafox add this card last week asking him you'll for a possible spoilers he said if I get a collie I can one be 9 so I want to see it all right. It was leading up to the game vs EG the undefeated team so what you do from Sprint. this will sacrifice place 10 minutes of the top is all about the aggressive plays all about the Tea play now pox is at that level six. Oz actually part of the fight just going to be a lot of damage wanted I'm just going to be a lot of pain does have flax. Going to help you much the way I hereby even has the extra landed here making a follow-up Diamond does not land that's they're onto definitely trying to get away by Jose wow everybody's looking at towards the bottom side Olaf power climbing Through the Jungle trying to catch up after the disastrous level 1 invade for himself and is at least able to get that do drugs effective for Life West the damage down here that was kind of going to happen to them is quite low 5436 CS over in that midlane is the TF keeps trying to scale top laners are closed but again a pretty tight game between these two 425 Huntersville difference is what in early First Blood cost so even after the field invade the teams of an overall living about equal and the reason we didn't see in fact in the NATO Spotify plays is obviously that he used to sell for it level
dignitas keep themselves cold or hot diggity hot in this one against The Undefeated class now it's time to find out Gabby welcome again to the battle arena Cloud by looking at an undefeated run throughout the first 6 weeks of the 2020 season so far tickets Austin just one game behind that third place. It was love to be able to beat the tee to break that undefeated 349 and also would be a big win for them in the standings because we have so many things that are so close you really do need to going to scrape and Claw for every single win that you can get I would say as far as thieves that have a shot of taking down Cloud9 I do think that having someone like booty that gives dignitas chance at it right is this guy who can go crazy in the game who can take over a game and is willing to play extremely risky and we talked about it on the desk there talkin about the coins with the detective thing and it's another way of saying they're willing to take big risks sometime then kept don't always pan out but if it does maybe that's what you think then father appropriate what you are on paper the weaker team I think that is the way you find your upset win in the meantime though improve improve improve you can't quench have a game that's not how you do how you go far in a season know I think they're actually quite targeted yes we saw you know we know we can probably see some Robo support at some point soon in all that foot overall do they feel pretty targeted Briggs & Beyond Olaf uni known as the great Rumble player don't have it says his fans think of the instant I would love to see things and give give me a foot fit give me a true hard counter Pick 4 Lane that you can kind of dominated try to have an Avenue to play through because one of the big struggles that you have been having against about 9:30. Is that cloud 9 has just been winning every way and then the truck was a cool where do I go what do I do and they're also could have been like becomes very difficult and yeah this could be a Lucian Tapas could be just a standard more bottling play moving towards that but why the top one who needs that I'm feeling it give me the champion packs it all week calling it now if this does or not you can blind it early with the intention of flopping around right if a frog and Johnson and Tony are all comfortable playing it there is going to be somewhere that is going to work out for top Wainwright licorice respect the fact that hey maybe I'm landing in solution I have to fix something that can actually match up well against it then we got picked a really strong match of into it then maybe give me something else yet if I'm sick of toxic jungle here right I leave all three lanes open as a possibility come and get it at second band face and then you pick one okuu you slightly remove the options of possibility of a butt it can still get all threat did you grab channel to take the least amount of Pickens progress there and now Cloud 9 says okay well I mean to be done now right as a tooth for so long he's got every Champion I mean to pay to play a d Lisa serious about it so Hospital in their bed right now if it's like they give us insight into where they believe the pick will be going right if we see them Banning out more top laners they made me think he's going elsewhere on the map but stop because if you double ban any of those lanes and they can just send the Lucia's there and say great you wasted your band so not assuming that it is going to be another that I think is quite strong currently yep if you don't think that Jonathan has actually selected lukanette is bothering her play the guitar playing at midlane bands I can't do everything at least back. So I'm assuming those are ones that are reasonable into him he also is just pretty safe in the most matchups because you have very good range to require a strong dose of the most played for Nikki had for the Wii games to Kiana everything else is only one play so I'm fitted Comfort it is safety regardless of what frog and wants to play mid lane Lucian or not these are solid band sofa camping band Out means it will be a miss you push down so I can push down a little bit here to and worried about the possibility of another a d solo laner because he at least has already locked-in they noted has has a chance to go towards that has more Frontline I think Tom is not to fill of Frontline or he's going to save things that would be easy Needham now KY or something someone is lineup so I will say if you want to play sideline you don't necessarily have to write if you're going to commit to split Bush we now know this is Lucia Soul unless it's going really crazy with pink sole you know you could have TK there more as the safety for the Jinx to be able to allow Jinx the wave clear play two aside Lane Tom Ken Chenault to that side lane to try to help take advantage of that and try to win the game through that I finally taking down towers and putting pressure on creating a big Advantage there so if that's the style you want to go for you don't necessarily need it for a minor but I do agree if it comes to v e v when you're looking over what I asked it already feels ways your text to Don unless they do you want to go to something like that Malachi was only enough I think it's actually a pretty good batch of rocks then he is a very strong tanks I need anything like Victor pretty quickly here because jinxed is not be waived through a tkr you pick when you're just okay Lucian go once you on the side light must see you admit she is always said that it's Barrel unless I fruit is perfect every time that you could knock him in instead so if it's silver crate you know who should all day I can find for that kind of roller skates not for but it's unsafe and that's the dangerous of a rock based on about gun control at utilizing the wall as well as the Nvidia ultimate try to force-feed awkward position 459 but as far as a straight-up engage as far as you would expect the Cloud 9 has a much more simple composition of blabber with the Harding a follow-up from brahmas whales eat rocks in a couple of strong fat liners there is no Brom against the MSO fairly easy Lair Game of Ultimate overtop dignitas needs to get violated and just needs to get early-game advantages you have the least you have the Lucian to clear Target cure will be a frost and feels like what a lot of the game is going to be centered around and didn't toss at that was enough of the side lane advantage that's going to be diffident as they have later on won't matter one of those two lanes and after seeing a ticket on said okay it's popping and Divya is in let's see how well the match of plays out no one has really come close to beating Cloud Nine all year long, I'm sure it is surprising licorice is bringing top most Play 4 Lane you can pretty much be a lot of players are are really not players at practice at all with Ignite stop playing because they feel like hey you're never going to see it's never going to have a place in competitive because it is so all in your lane early one bad gang One battery call and all the sudden the person with tell for it just has a Monumental experience in Golden Vantage so hoody must play well in the early game bring must defend and from what games from blabber or the game plan is going to be out the window and the Top Lane I haven't seen the team pins where they do nothing big night but I'm sure they're saying it Out Loud by real quick on the sidelines. Pajama Sam Hui think I'd of dignitas this is quite the spicy to ask my friend any thoughts on this one yeah we have a lot of comfort pics obviously tonight's a very good team and we just want to be comfortable on the roof to make sure that we can get the setup that we walk and make sure that we are confident in those situations we definitely tried it outside since we can always has priority usually doesn't have like the best TP place in solution just wants to push in the whole game so it's something that was tried out a little bit and hopefully it pays off thank you guys for the cast I think that's an interesting point and an illusion definitely when you take help words. About the seclusion TV flag but it's about consistency for the actual 131 the time's right because you think one bad trade you can't believe in trunk logo and you don't die and you don't have teleport all the sudden you're losing all those ways that you're sure that you're losing all the experience and that can be enough to turn a match up around but if he is winning it is going to give him much earlier kill pressure is going to indicate a lot of the killing that eat rocks has depended upon in any potential all in with his ultimate so I'm very excited to see me pull this off this is the kind of pic I was going for right now if you're expected to get smashes 500 doing to everyone hey take a risky pic look for something that can maybe be the difference in winning the game so far and it has been denying licorice as you made it fixed also as a surprise to nobody both Rent-A-Center bottom size that they can get the whole three and then be on the top side of the map to affect this matchup 1 to 10 theater the game top side is he at least has made her way to the top jungle and dragons have done this as well as also about the halfway point as well right now but maybe definitely a long time favorite the man to check out the rooms here for me also he is actually going into the manifold band an absolute Focus so yeah also took instead of Triumph he's taking extra friends of mine in the ALCS you almost always see people take over heels on that ruined here this is very heavily itemizing towards man out what this tells me is when he's not going for an Essence Reaver build I'm expecting split it ruined King into Black Cleaver and more of this kind of early in focus and just depending upon the corrupting potion manaflow band and the stacks that you can get from friends of mine to be enough Mana from Death Valley all the camps were gone in deep Weber is back in the bottom side of the map boards just be still for that but it is going to leave Top Lane pretty safe and isolated exactly what he wants more information Univision so this is this is because money is actually not going to be called licorice did go back to base got a cloth armor as well as the refillable so this is where you know who he now has made the choice to try to freeze a Wave Rider group it and have it push towards him which is going to put Liquors in a dangerous position I think that is why we see Greg up here on the map they want this pushing Lane that Greek and then attacked licorice in and try to at least at the teleport out or get some summer is out to punish him that's because if they don't do that and liquor stable to hang around he still has his help work to one more bass no for another early item and maybe you've made it through that most dangerous match up and can no longer really be punished and see if course right now the $300 difference in Lane is expected for the farm difference nice W get the cannon that's pretty crucial that has to drop the casters for now 51 West Point down in the river that's pretty expectable from who needs I'd he has not gotten space to put his own Ward down right now in Brick so he was topside it's a kind of got missed he only had sleeper so great couldn't help word that starts with right now there is no vision to know if blaviken south side and they're not likely to try to go for any sort of early. Over onto who need their knowing that if we were to show up move you pretty soon so you know any likely once he pushes out he will then go in and look to Concord it up but I'll licorice willing to take a dip sit here and if this is not a match up where you have to feel like you need to go exactly even or or anything like that as far as the farm goes you can be okay being down in a 15:20 CS if you are against it at night Lucian and you can just keep it even at that point throughout the game the way I feel now push down towards Liquors inside of us as well bring a board to sleep in that brush how to push him out of range a little bit. The important part it's Greg I don't need the paper that part and it's okay I respect me okay so now who he is Dick's they could actually try to dive this with the culling if you can actually walk down Liquors there is potential they are but they don't know where bladder is so they're not going to actually look for it and whatever mean while I was just doing the dragon to your ocean conveniently for licorice will be incredible in this one the one where you are expecting to get bullied having that additional regen is going to make it much more comfortable and definitely moves the needle of no surprise here is the bottom line lead is going to miss Fortune Lane absolutely get stronger later than big Shirley on unless you are a add row CC like what's prank drinks and do some stuff to put on the Choppers if your top 10 you are probably going to. Yeah but thankfully for them there's a divorce yet or Johnson pickups though and if he will be even or ahead you take a Teleport versus if he loves been do they have had parties they've been able to get those preferential faces off but it was us far Cloud9 holding drawing in this early game and things have been able to find any attempted game with their Elite not being able to do really blow open the game through Top Lane or something like that either it's not that loosen need to win by this point but you know what it is concerning a bit if the game face Lucas over handed Easley defrost no skill the missed out of an app what would happen if there was no chase
Immortals are part of the Zoop every team Bagley has five or six wins and Immortals will have five or six wins as a day's blg with the dubious honor of being in last they just beat us a day weekend in earlier today also picking up their second wind so often considered pretty good weekend has been a really rough flip for the Oreck but we're all looking I think a lot better since they got pobelter we saw some is blaming SAS but that's was talking about him I think he's had three straight really solid laning phase is Acropolis games he has been looking strong and in the Victor game yesterday got player of the game it was really all about him in the later stages he dominated that game against TSM and that was the first time I really saw him take a good morning face and turn that into a game Victory So Cal turfcan you compete Immortals as well as the one where it was my sin just like ran down there Nexus movie look who's in a winning situation in the first place so do you want to do the early to mid game looks like it's obviously sitting at a much better record for their on a four-game losing they went for 5 and 225 in the sticks so yes field has been the worst team overall on the split but you know in these last couple weeks are the only thing that has a lot of these two and they did take down one of the teams that a lot of people were considering one of the best in the league in TSM so we'll see how they're going to be able to perform here today was it a fluke or can they really start to get some consistency with this roster who would like this and see him always happy when there's a lot of teams fighting for the pots with all the teeth feel pretty good and seam seal Jane do better with make me happycalories in if nothing else to be locked in a room down here is be a smelly husband of Sarah suppose gaunt's then also dropped as well but knew from the very beginning we're going to go to the support and you go and pick up the suspect real life because we're having the ADP player you know the bottle warmer play it so people are our kind of a bit shocked by that that is turning things around and also the other mix-up I would say that you're expecting to be support but alongside a more traditional Mark Spitz writing style Champion guess what it's actually pretty good to have down there in that bottom Levi wiki wiki farmingI was surprising I think they're from the 20th has to talk to you connected with said when he's a negative resistance is it makes you incredibly Tanki and you're going to win any of those kind of wine do you want style tools do is jungle match up there for a trundle feeling pretty good about that guy has called I would argue without looking at the most lifetime from games of any LCS player actually I'm sure we can get that checked out but without looking I will agree with you at all but look pretty good for him to talk about to pass to go we argue no pushing forward to take medication as well we can expect to get down there being locked in until g-side so yeah it's going to see hima lot more overtime as well and makes me a good front line and then you're going to have a decent all of damage before snap their I also really like the pairing of triangle with Ms Turnbull was played us at 4 to ask you because you can feel her people spoil them down and kind of block them fairly easily into this whole time is that ultimate no making that even easier for I have to get an effective sink light off because it's not fine if you're right on point with it but feeling bands coming out here for CDLslooking to have to protect the van I was going to say is played two games of his ear and the one Victor game he did show yesterday if they want to blow their Midland right here and make them so they're going to lose midlane bins out just save that last car fixed or ruin by with a trucks coming through you do expect that to go top for ruin this is just a very standard blanket that people are really comfortable with you know most of the matchups that actually are very very difficult grade rocks and abuse porch. And people aren't really playing split Bush so people are so happy to play the atrox when you think about Camille we think about Jackson you think about no Quinn and all these Champions that it was you were playing another example right so if you are willing to play that style then it can be very good but there you goCamille I like how 4 weeks I've just been like that why people just take this another one time like while they're not going to take a break I really do not feel quite a bit I do think that Camille is a very favorable matchup into that eat rocks brunch OKC last year and actually quite effectively so we'll have to tell also as can do in this matchup but it can be very difficult for HR quick trades utilizing the physical damage are very very effective in 28 Rockton he talks down to offer will be preferential with the trundle there you have some consistent one line damage also with Cassio and ass so I do think that the Mortal competition is very well-roundedmy favorite you know honestly incredible Shockwave here from feels he's so I do think there's a few like small point that I do like happy that you can Shock Me for knowing it escaped back and look pretty good from looking at least blackout bullet time like, sorry I was wrong to block out all the time so that there are some small thing builds you can have but I tend to agree I'd like to go to five on five especially because of that tank and snake spitting to be nearly Invincible exactly what are the things that you do if you have a composition that is actually going to win front of fighting their front line and a killer out the DPS in the back line away from getting to your back line slow down your back like UPS have free access to their tanks will there's doesn't have free access to you can be quite effective we will see if the LG can make a liar out of me in something off hereI want to watch absolutely Pulitzer his fourth game back on counter logic gaming Championship back about four or five years ago the big run made it back to their win rate took down TSM yesterday has a mortal's deflated a really exciting to watch out what they can do for Mortal self can move up to a tie for third themselves fixed winds is third place right now and would like to do is take down CO2 to get there themselves and we'll nothing working here for coz is that they did have counterpick for mid lane and I talked about how pobelter has been having really good Landing Bays has thus far the split-end he does have the counter pick into cash so you can outrange Cassiopeia and you really can get preferential trade as a result inside info from clg's can't possibly take awaythanks guys I got welding with me biggest question for CLG coming off of a huge win against TSM how are you guys going to keep the momentum rolling into this game against Immortals I think yesterday we didn't we had a pretty stable or the games we got to play a very comfortable game and I think that's at the prior to today is to to try to not messing up early so we can have a nice comfortable game I had a comfortable game where no one invades you you win all your lands and you never down and gold that's how I said I hope that's a good game yeah you know where are my games I like that you know I don't know if that's true we play do I did also because I'm maybe anything to my way to phone a couple cool things to know I was in case rash on both mid laners here I do think this is an especially smart choice for pobelter when you're going up against rely heavily on those Lowe's turn do you know you talked about the reliability of the pillar but you know this person you start running at them Auto fuw Fay's restaurant and he can just run straight out a miasma also is a very heavy slow so this is going to allow pole vaulter I think she feel pretty safe in his ability to escape cakes. I would think you reset to tasks his W-2 if you're like Auto attack reset actual attack speed games are very very small you don't tend actually say that much time to talk to yourself down because it takes so long to kill anyway yeah she probably saves a good quarter second or so I can't be doing that order it's pretty interesting it's also you will taking a little bit of damage do you can maybe get more out of the region on that wa something but does make a difference and it looks like now he is just going to try to go for a wraparound gank on mid-length here already free easy till it runs right back about that puppy superflash yeah I would think he definitely does either way though good gang right do you take what is a losing match up and that's half the help off of that lane opponent there so what is supposed to be a matter for Bob out there can become equalizer losing match up with that one little gang Domingos down Quigley is technically up a camp right now looking out of the top side is Camille is pushing in and it ruined can land this goal shots could look nice I like the forms that you know if it's not with me right now and look at that was running back with nothing could be a freeze do this connection is awesome Farm exactly this is one of those really awkward situations where you know you're not supposed agreed to walk up to the wave your but you're not sure is the jungle still there and with every two big fun comes across Alaska women out trundle is here as well as change down means first away mid John ROM dolphin pose did not answer. How is fantastic from Immortals that such an awkward position to be a Nessa talk later because if you don't step up the wave your wave will get Frozen you can be in a lot of trouble so they roll up weekly actually canceled his base not realizing that Seca en xmithie were on their way up there so ends up being the first one for them the curse is actually finish this basic yeah just didn't realize I think it would be up here for a thought he was just going to have walked back to face you know recalled and reset there as he was missing by the way first blood for a cut double Buffs on him also it's going to be a really big deal there early on conveyor belt. They would be the follow-through anyway and maybe he's right but it's more of a thousand gold Lee death of a great role the top side of the math he cannot even down Farm after all that play together stay like that where you get your full complete is deer your knee feeling really really happy that does alleviate most of your man issues as Cassio who is a very very many Hunger Champion so earlier to get that backing up and I feel really good and also is a Seraph completion does change your ability to keep I very heavily you know you are a kind of like a mid-range bottle of champagne you you have to be in range of damaged really to get the most damage deal to me very very useful to play around getting drunk heavily does toxic you that was crucial this is so much Fame is coming in nearly gets the solo kill just to hold his Flash and that is actually crazy how much damage he got there the double bus alarm to really stand out he didn't even hit a cue to start tax rate that was purely a non poison Target and he almost killed him so it does show you the power of all of that is just wrong man I thought he has with its year-end that blew off and it's going to be to tell for forced out here from pobelter where I think I should just be able to get an EZ reset after this Dragon stencil it right now it's 6:50 safe as well with the 30 most Advantage we had from the passive hope to have boots yet so just didn't make the acre run faster and it's going to look really good both solos on the immortal side feeling very comfortable by pretty quick Drake coming down as well before its run will have no problem at all so long that one out and I'm bored as hell looking awesome in this early game is the fact that before she did bring teleport and this is a nod to two-factor your landing at the Hedgerow hope you don't expect to have a tremendous amount of pressure in the early stages and most casualties day do take tp2 Aberdeen Lane to be able to get a really good bass come back and keep you shoved in and domination leaning that way so it's going to be a relatively passive Lane people in pressure of himself make it shoved into other gods that far but it's a five Cs least let's to kill putting the Early Learning stats awesome here for a cuz it's 50 no looks or the blue bus steel just reward comes down vision and now Wiggly can Toppers Light Fight their equal level and if I go to the Smithy 19
LCS jungler of all time high for a second in trophies with Pearson another fun fact from the game show earlier today we had a test question where they pulled the audience most underrated player in all of the LPS and they got the most votes wins but I think you call him the second best player of all time and actually candidates that surrounds so I see that actually probably feels in here or I am here unless I have a plan for attacking it I do think of a more balancedfactory reset bypass for the Olympics is left up already left up there if they're going to grab Diana stuck people in set up she fights for a failure can be really big part this building around this Champion people who has Lain Fades and getting him either, can program and that is important to know because they are the champions does not have to Festus of its own you need a support with defenses to supplement dog but I also like the offensive mind when you're around a bilious and you want to play off your big flamethrower place be able to get infernum individualwell water damage to be there for a CO up there the Midland on syndrome models grab very early on have seen some Nautilus mid that was grabbed over in Europe just couple days ago but has been locked in we do know that's not support a truck picked up the topside I was old and bottom for any sort of a fellow Aquarius also comes the big I do like the Nautilus looking for hoes trying to remain proactive also point-and-click set up for Sandra later on in the gameImmortals here setting up a side post has revealed already though so it does mean that we will get a counter picks for cold and flu I still got those go back and forth for the first it's in Centerville go to The Mortals die I do wonder if there is a small chance I don't think it's the case cuz I don't think he's the best wrestler Nautilus don't come through if you guys better take him to Better Built like a deer for cold and flu so he actually gets his pick of the litter by Giada for this late for the LPS and maybe some fries Lycoming o-320 should be in almost every chance collection dispatch through the think she's probably the best tank jungler and maybe the today to yeah and if you don't I mean the block can do it but go to the hospital high that the central player has so many offices Where is the Love Lock Bridge in draft games being able to get those deals very easily in lane and being able to you'll have the pad a lot more often as far as he fighting that we played the big part of it if I am a blah sticker my biggest worries are always pointed click for later on in the game because a lot of guys to go for those you'll poke APA style place to go for a big amount of first right now so it's at least you know for his benefit there's no point in life where they can easily La Cordon Bleu doubt if he does he'll become a problem gets the most early Kelsey's acknowledgement out of the car for a while and let you get back to safety with a good time Panic sit waiting in the wings as well yeah so as long as I will say is Tom has not been exciting pick was the looking at right choice and will continue to be a player one of his better games here today goes. It's only a single game behind Immortals just on the scale edge of flat Fitzsimmons early in the top-six have you heard talk to us saying it take to fill a top for top 5 team got to make sure they're early game looks good on the got to go to the latest if I can do it here all right it actually I think them being closer on stage Ronnie is a bit it's a little bit of a relief not the biggest early move maker she does combo will with aatrox though I do like this energy is a chocks is often able to set up in gauges in Lane whenever the atrox needs and if so which one is right behind them then you stacked up your son's even quicker pause and fortunately and as always with pause in the game I like to say things that aren't terribly important everyone just get in the game as I'm passing the LSAT are and I'll check but a quick tutorial on saying his screen name French doesn't have accidents syllables like the English word emphasis you say m Harding to the rest of the letters French everything is very flat so you say if I lease a car and that's a part of screen and he did confirm that even though I hear so many of his teammates calling and Micah do you like a lot of us have done in the past to but we will remain consistent Aika will be pronounced correctly free kids Akins up Princeton little bit of your French lessons what's up I pulled you to decide because I'm wondering what was the reasoning behind putting Apollo in here today I'll take about like it's reality hasn't been playing for like a whole year comes back another pressure has been taking it out we talked to in the past like all the last 20 years ago and make it sound very confident in saying and I felt like it was good to try these synergies why we in the Smith Springs pay to see how well we can freak you know it looks energy for the team quality God wants what's impressive Apple a good we can be using all 10 players in just another need a 5 o clock to you in the team back to you guys well Apollo already earning them a gold lead Linda Ward kill beautiful big difference bottom as everyone else Apollo is nicest guy in the ALCS if you don't know that now you do and there's a certain the offseason when people work on a Shopkins what seems to be on and you know clutch went away and all that I need to get off to me it's okay to take one let go get a starting spot I'm okay on Academy and Indian taco gotta start about me LPS deposit okay Academy life and now he's back back with his that sounds a bit aggressive but they're hanging out together yet again stop playing fighting Hans was losing Health hits tow us back I like it the spider game play-by-play yep that's it I noticed they didn't actually completely engaged but yeah that is a big hero again we mentioned such a whiny free things restaurant around the entire patch a lot of matchups for Leon can get pretty good job trying to move in especially with Lanes pushing up and does get the red box deal Aker nice little trade your on the golden glue with the sun and when you have jungles Supremacy as such a big Dimension to the LeBlanc syndrome a ship where they're syndra gets you really ditch out that punishment rather than having to be worried about all right do I have to respect this LeBlanc change that much and the Distortion combo because there's going to be a drunk or as well but you got to fold with the Red Bluff invade not only does Xfinity do it away but you ensure that a kid can actually bully more heavily in the mid lane so far so good Immortals looking through a little bit small farm leads the most matchups there is the bottles got to go see Smith as well as everything they can about war does a he is Depakote and topside freshlook juking the brush but that's a nice pic of what they know all right interesting closers actually going to wrap around from where Smith he's just came from but could be too late we called us complete Grayson Gary Goldenberg Gilmer of all the Guardians cannot stop the recall when is that a man is going to take his own recall back in but I could have managed back is closer to let you know I'm overtaken will get back on track CS go to the driving was and knows he can coach Camp play it all comes from when you point out revealing himself walking over at midlane xmithie there does mean that closer can find the counter Farm basically monster though has to back off now like hard-nosed that said that the garbage popsike is as far as food was triggered it it hit the ward Forever at all and froze do they know he was topside please play offensively nice Ferrell changes play by so as trade back missed every skill shot Hunter the only kind of Jefferson way up in thinking that I'm probably be killed by now meanwhile go to go skating at the store do you buy tit W get some slow down here as well as chains on top as long as I can track he's still here with the route for the damaged if it quite there and cleanse was there regardless of the flash down to health park on acre in face yeah definitely it's it's the flash flood and also a big chunk of damage what are the things that you needed it quickly as possible especially as mid laner when people come in for trades like that on on you if you're going to have to bring your class anyway Burnet early so you don't also take the damage and are also forced into this recall because look right now it's mini wave gets pushed in your summer spell is still gone either way but you can't stay there. On even more for the slow they could get you follow whatever and that's the flash wait for her answer and they can't get it arranged in a can of Smithy cute so early is it away with the flash out got the idea they're obviously when flashing in for the slow as you're trying to get a flash out first then you follow but Indian Summoner spells traded say so there are points of attack year for both sides in different so Elaine not there with no flash topside could be a repeat visit it's 50 does need to get to level 5 first I think first before returning Brussels fall a little bit further behind in Farmington toxin that has access to the ultimate at 8 Doc's is very capable at fighting you off if you continue to spam gangs if you're too low level Shane's found just back to Taco came to Rome the middle and make sure they can stay safe babe is pushed in Gold even come by as well but he will once again walk by a board seat cuz this is aggressive towards useful comes over 3 on 3 down here find sunglass little slow but not to a device right all right big difference is going to be how they rotate into the river for the shuttlecraft I think that's golden Guardians should be able to retain it no flash remember on a Quran the syndra so his positioning is so important to go to who's got his eyes on him feel comfortable as well without getting your body needs to get one of scuttle no real titles and if it's something really incredible and that doesn't happen as those bought the movement tacos back in the bottom Lane and the garbage is taken under control. Now it's drinks go over golden Guardians feeling pretty comfortable here the game tied in Gold overall frequent 7 his overall in Mount Drake on their credit another recall heerfordt syndrome another trip back to base they give up the objective and let another wave push course it's right here look at that Cannon denied so as to pick whatever the Top Lane their kill I want 100 that's damaged going to lose a toe 100hp needs getaway very deceptive I think that is a Kill Ya trying to slow maybe another q in their know you might find the next girl shot of the day it's so I won't be down no damage dealt it doesn't even up to Somers post there where I can had been forced into several recalls pretty early on due to having no flash see if that will actually turn it around for himself still has the cleanse ready for stage 1A ultimate as a closer and expect they are both fairly close to that level six point trying to get a little bit more access to the CC now go to Guardians pushing slightly in the bottom side small farm leave as soon as it gets me grab his concert pics and look up the top side so it's getting counterpick on this one the Gangplank looking very good in his face rockso
been a lot of thinking of TSM and you can actually see it in their games on LCS in their specific they have had to physically very good early games especially behind our dock dogs have highest first what percentage has the highest average game time for a rear comparison when you think about them focusing a y on the early game and trying to throw ball golden tickets early game that split it was like 8,000 voltage on a minutes I think failed to close out on and that is something that is Dino going to be an albatross around their neck is you know they've got to figure out how to play those games out process in traditionally SS said that himself even a few days ago and he screams he talks about Team Liquid strength that's traditionally been in the five players being better individually than their opponents and feeling to team fighting later on winning the game that way which directly to craft a contract with the way that gives them has been losing so let's see if we cansome of the most notorious Kelly Biggs orange is off the table Affiliates off the table and you do you mean Super annoying yeah we're already getting first fix that for them though it is they want all the games have they lost every cent of game they lost their Ash game Twins were on damaged carries for double if it's still ended up being the Team Liquid doublelift carried you over the wind damage why send the roster this weekend and that means like yelling to learning a new style to win and that never worked and now they are not reliable if they have to undo Southwestall right let's get an attempt selectman veritime cash locked up very safe I like this combination especially know where it's one of those 80 carries that's kind of difficult with your positioning sensor power still gets out early Lane phase Springs SPC to the bottom side as well Jack to be very strong do a label see now it's at school and chords they want to go up against that we tend to see toppling plus pot Duo grab in the early rotations in camping select there's the MF great champ has overall and the blitzcrank hover I like but I think it's not what goes in a flight all right double down on that for is time change that most Champions you know what but can't win for winning the bet ya win all of my winnings from the ALCS game is actually more fun all-time stats because I looked at so many random pads preparation for the game show all of you this is going to be a lot of power you can also trundle pick into it is up right now so we'll see if TSM want to focus on Jungle pants as liquid still have to grab there's two of my favorites into it gets what's right or was I just mentioned no longer an option I really like Olaf into it when I went over my chemo talked about they don't want to play for pulling early game which is a lot of what that's about. Napoli run over sidhwani a lot of it is dueling an invading and playing a strong Lane since we traditionally think that's a good are going to go for more of a v e v setup for later in the game probably won't be the thickest get that probably won't have to wait to bet on it either broken plate options broken blade has been such a huge part of kids and cigarettes part of their flexibility in Champion Select Netflix so many different Champions to the top Wayne hymns are talking jurickson all Trading Co set born piano style Champion for themselves which is really been a big Advantage. CSM workers go to the jar from the old after this one will see exactly obrochta wants to play his beliefs sin is up notable in a lot of a shark with a deal might be concerned about it's kind of hard to bend Tomatoes black specks on toddlers back going to go with the general power that's left up for for solo pics since then you're going to have to reveal one right now Aurelia Aurelia assassination definitely has been used by TSM already I think I'll pull in here right you leave your keys and Pick 4 last movie really want play in or you're something yeah and flexible technically can still move it a good pick in December just don't see that matches very often but it should be savored exactly and favored in the sense that you're scaling right deer kill with the extra range earlier on huge Boon to The Landing and should be able to type the set very effectively now what are the problems with the shield that room is actually getting a decent vs lease in that game however they created action on that top side of map and kind of messed up the scale scaling part of its way from 59th and Dixie in the last game at Fort Jackson I'll Malachi is certainly a hover I'm not there are lots of really viable Top Lane tanks not named Dorn in this patch Alki malphite poppy set jungle cinderhulk is very good as well as realistic as they actually do you like triple what I like this so much he's orange playlist good morning likely yes no rush every game some Hall of Fame and named are Aquarius lyrics it going to continue I apply question get their win but looks like we're going to have a tree in the middle of a gar versus I love it especially with your people using spells so frequently and I will see some of that ridiculous dealing with make it up through the middle and it will be the new way for TSM broken played on the big hairy for them killing later on I love it I love it so much going to be very exciting there was a great fact line it is kale top in broken places that have an outstanding your Auntie has been so far doesn't get a lot of gang has very good fats, there is a very consistent player good csgo damage numbers and CSS innovating I see what all the fuss to text the first Malachi of the split in the LCS Travis capitis denied me. So far for the support there are vendors three Malachi's all year long if you count like the regional leagues and everything else I did he use the cat skin or the Malachi can we get a room for you that's what I like that for S&W after the attack it supposed to be out of it sdsm walk back out first lick nicely done play a sedimentary maokai picks so far worldwide competitive 223 were two days ago some of the regional leagues were playing do you have to build up there because I'm expecting him to just out tank Abyssal Sunfire like walking Zone play going tank build and probably expect to see something like a spirit visits built as well just to make the most out of that passive but it is it is always remember those days where you stack up a bunch of the saplings in a brush someone gets shot walking through. Now so it can't quit you that thing was not great and got mostly helps healing abilities but has very very quick attack frames like the dew point in the swing with the impact it's very early so I plan on jungleland surprised at even the level one attack speed that he has now tell Marcus one of the Champions. Lane take back in 2017 where was George came out they gave him a little toppling tank Nautilus 50% tax be so he's got like looking for a package to the game I was so surprised I thought they had done it so good for John like she's kind of clear as well all right we'll still see ascend it's you know he's getting some as far as I can be I like that summary. 5, is also getting some stuff basically they're doing the same right they are both numbers I believe there are both in Smirnoff that's nice I like that as of your students refuse to take any damn pit people see us right now top is pushed it back in their good punch not bad can you fix some degree of this I think dueling said early on doesn't happen even if they all had some range jeweled it's just a man if you have too much I mean Focus here 100% yeah for broken way it is all on farming it's all on trying to grab the last year we were stealing exactly with the door on shield with the passive healing there honestly it's better to use more of his Mana trying to control the wave Impacto has three and it got brought back as well there's a chase down a baby what timing 40 l HGTV her birthday party has to do with the waves going to freeze against him in a Flash the scale is such a big Target yeah this is a really really scary situation for Broken Blade that's why I look at your mini-map immediately they have Dar. Heading up to the top side because the wave is pushing away from kale he's got no flash you have to have your juggler around to make sure you can try and get that wave bounce officer it and continue to descale here for the couch and this is, but again it's going to have to wait from afar yeah I don't think. I wouldn't put you onto with a flashlight scale Who's down a level so have a look at it but that man that time he just got around the corner Roku but you get a seat at minion that he's failed over to impact at the melee on himself just never get this done one enemy on both sides and flashes right over to follow him unless we done right there as we look back at how the midline is going it's still equal to mid lane tankfarm doing just fine for the arson I really do enjoy the fact that he's taking more of a tank roll I know you know years past it was for like you're someone denied ever knows his award but he's got more supportive women Capri and it's been interesting to watch the development of the team as well really playing to the personalities and styles of their player broken blades excelled a lot on you know those damaged carries so trying to open up room that way stop being sad bottom land again we're going to focus on tactical know he's in this high pressure situation show me a Galaxy S8 is going to be pushing a lot but the various X Kenshin. That they doing that you see, you think all of this Mana spamming a day are we on the way of trying to continually shove it in to get a little bit of her ass there as well as accept pretty close to the minion but they get the recall off Prime powers of your wave on a Canon wave does get executed by for JJ there do the guy 52-cs at 10 different to go cut all seven the last play of the three call comes in Catskills consists mostly walk back without much issue msf course of sunglasses movie Speed is going to feel fine but hate NPS difference is still can be quite painful Predator I just saw activated by progress broxah fishing around on the top side but broken blades playing cautiously he knows any type of a big minion wave built-up is an objective that's Midland coming over last year someone to help out with the stop sign up in a cup of Broken Blade 3 numbers up Top Lane did the Gracchus but they knew something was up and that means that Zoe then gets to shove the wave in the Middle Lane so so she s on top side secured for Broken Blade but they lose out a couple As It Gets shoved in quickly to the tower here in Midland and drinks and kind of Paid It Forward there with a little bit of support your submissives golden altar email has been at least one of the cats finished down there you talked about him being more selfless is it here if it's not on three and he's also have quite a few moments where he talked about leadership and these things he's looking a lot more closely at with the team just to have they know they've got a problem up here on the top side because of that early well played gang from Team Liquid that well. It's nice to see Ashley Brock so kind of returning to the four people
anyway we got a game going Cloud 9 and flyquest the two top of the split ever gone undefeated TLC at the cloud nine or more than halfway there black West those but hey dignitas you and me where they come downstairs this week this weekend incredibly excited for this match up Ciara flyquest have been climbing up the ranks of the power of evil a lot due to ignorance so it supports as well as big Lanes prices going to be so far from there so I know how that goes through and as voted by the audience awaydefinitely strong a number three in a list of popular for blind taking Four Tops died and can be Flexin To The Jungle which I think will be here for Cloud 9 but so many top laners I thought you really liked the atrox side of the set match up because the control that you get me to Winter range in which with your uncle - though that's the immediate answer here for Black Widow big fries and he has not yet places near put a lot of his back when he was on TSN the last two and Tompkins goes alongside upstairs with lock into the bottomlands. TK away from there it would be a blast into the bottle and when he retireddefinitely classic for him do what kind of engages you can get the bottom line itself definitely difficult to diagnose full of Arkansas if they decide to have a struggler come on down and I really had a definite drunk as we talked about fluid Flex with that there though so just be a possibility he might be our on 10.4 we are on a new patch jungle take to come through I'm thinking to get what I mean by this weekend I'm thinking you're wrong. We are also getting some fancy to a power if you've always talked about how big of a turkey with such a big Champion for them last week by Adele. Tremendous amount of damage be able to win them that she's right around there and so good been there by Cloud 9another actually feel we focus band that still lasts and wait for counter-offer rumbles out there call t o e v Champion classify him as a player they're not looking at things are like with long e on IT band out here looking at Stats overall overall we need to Champion we all do that all the time and all the time right now for the right here on this side no sense whatsoever the other side here but is very poor flyquest normal-looking draft the ribbon could you tube and a wave I've never used to play that champion at least it wasn't going to look good 59 you always look at their mittens jungle combination they do have to Mid right now for dick you will be more difficult but with the AC locking here for Dragon it does open up the possibilities here for Nifty going 80 I thought Midland movie theater blind note as the pants will get locked in let's be still has quite a few option syndra is still available still available I didn't like how they played with it when he did have a guilty though it's also known for other long-range mazes but there's a danger that we mentioned it as well overall it looks pretty good. Give us a charge of the top when the government of suspected I think they're heading onto the roof with a with a decent chance here nobody with any heart in to hear nobody with any you do math without scale either will play there's not a ton of amazing targets right away so sometimes it looks like looks can be difficult we know Tom Kent likes to pick into simpler if I can afterwards that you can save it but I think there's some real life with you as well can be here also remember has the lowest dual proximity of all support in the ALCS that means you roam simos so definitely look for this blitzcrank to go get tools on other lanes times burn Summoner spells for the rest of the team down and do it. The bus that way and I'm looking to see the blitz Frank coming to bed pretty early on we're here for the trees see if they can do it. Show this year alone in second place is a great return before we're happy about Mother Nature all the above. Find the most this season as he is a kill leader on Fly Away Cloud 9 have absolutely been on a stair this with 10 and 0 so far fastest game time highest KDA best stats across the board for this team thanks God that he would Curry and we have got the flyquest chance behind us a big match for you going to get the number one team Cloud9 tell me how do you prepare these players for a match like this isn't too much different from what we normally do and I'd like to know they're just not a team we just make sure that we have the grass that we want and the job that you want to play and I were just ready to go sure there another team but they're the number one team on top of the rankings there has to be something that added into that preparation more than anything make sure that we're just not scared I think we play until it seems like really confident and playing them so maybe you can see there might be a little more hesitation because they're so decisive. Just make sure that our confidence is there but I think it's a team we're really gotten ourselves in our place also we're ready to go up thank you and best of luck to you back for you guys thank you thank you Carrie for the words as well stay confident Don't Be Afraid Cloud 9 so good in the early can they'll have absolutely smashing North America this year with early pressure by the cross the border don't think they have any sort of innate Advantage as far as the Champions going for these early duels either so like what should have at least amount of time to get set up here doing some side clear Red Bluff into cruggs keeping his options open as far as where to go probably not going to focus on ganking for and asriel X Kenshin Vulcan in a van moving up very quickly though I'm happy to take a hook if there's going to be one there's a full day very much cuz it's alright we also have a top-down clear for santorin heading towards a half of the map Lisa and off of red Raptors trying to get to his level three see what his options are going for power we've also taking the climb. In the Midland vs. Zoe Force injury in case he does fall prey to H4 Bubble at gragas combinations can you wondered and if you grabbing me provel first pick up Piper liquor during Battle of here this morning to grab should be pretty close in far but licorice temporarily down and help keep mines that has done so it's not going to be a big deal as far as what they want to do any early games to hear 4 by Feist to I definitely want to try and play office was Frank show me what the only number 5 most annoying Champion shame on you lie Community especially for junglers get the first average there I mean honestly what are you doing get this do a q with Smite first day of and you also have a slight advantage to the academy team and this key just prancing around like nothing's wrong trap on the ground from Santo and because bottom weight has priority though you can see the move up to the river are going to secure staff at here for bladder for Cloud 9 Steamworks wow send gold share for both of them feels another sweep or my bladder nice last heading there for Vulcan for CVS on the board at the scale goes over bitching about this in Bay two is that we were looking at possibly trying to make something happen in the bottom Lane off of its blitzcrank that has ignite you know trying to get a kill on De Volcan on the time Kent is a possibility if you can't delete the game down bottom side because Vulcan fan positioning very aggressively far up and they can try and pull something in but because of the invade we have to work down there since when has to go top instead the first knock up a damaged flag control that he doesn't have a damn it just be on the way over to another Romeo from this key but I can't get there in time and flyquest right first first what I mean when they have their big rise last year in Spring flyquest top or team santorin was blamed really really well he's back out there getting conversion for the team that being said flaperon gragas part farming and it does have eyes level lead plus has been able to go back for the Predator food so happy we got this Replay have to keep your eyes on the Grog Ascent touring here classes in for the level 3 get to slow down critically first so he does not get the Q. Sometimes these people just threw out the sonic wave yeah but he's a guarantee that killed and they had to guarantee a quick because of the room from this dude that was called from power of evil to some good communication and presence of mind their flight was thinking about the timing on their gig as we said okay your eyes on bladder he's got to be level five on progress went backwards Predator boots recall an offensively blown flashes can be punished just as effectively here by Prince Antoine both plastic for it to try and get that body wash makes patch and shouldn't have any escape this key over the top cloud they will get it good job there to talk about punishing that flash they do so stand for in because they reveal themselves on the top side though trying to start up this objective if they can actually get anything finished up here Dragon does take quite a while for 4 I'm out in roaming back down Focus heading over to Ward it at the moment spotted Now by Santorum Borden actions last cones away is it going to be able to pick up their controller to the pixie we have to make sure and Wells black let's get away with First Blood bubble Farm but I could only get here for like 1 also because of the ramifications of that Top Lane counter here no pushing the wave in for licorice on the debt definitely right back on his be feeling very nice about the current state of topside set especially for the early stages year with the Bramble vest trying to get some healing reduction on aatrox very early in the game does solidify this area is a map for them and now we got to keep our eyes on this key so you can see how much they're investing into the wards in the river on topside to allow him these possible Rome she keeps on pushing in midlane he's not losing out on information out of Cs to go over this able to get harveyville at his power First Central though it's a big spike on level 6 as far as the one we want no son is a little early so he's going for their but ignores not here nice by step by new Walking Dead comes back alive it up and help the power people there you go for this dangerous done on where Zoe started her are from not able to get this done means that they're not going to begin eating out of that game because nisky really nice footwork dodging all the follow-up damage as well no hook Landing no cues Landing just such a confident mid laner here and that's not something that flight was since those talks about in the interview how big are is going to be in playing against Cloud 9 well right now five star down about five hundred gold and that's despite the extra 150 from the first blood coming through so good as to The Landing phase of Cloud 9 so far you've got about a to Camp lead for bladder and 15 CS for licorice going to paying that off and I'll see if like us and get more done course not drink is used in gold value I would say not at 500 just yet you know I like a licorice is playing this 250 mention oh yeah the early Bramble vest with the extra SDSU was able to get alphabet counter kill on viper at Turner turn it into a nice lead for him you don't get to solo kill the 8 Sox unless they charge chooses to make a mistake right if he goes too aggressive on you overcome its on this debt know he's applying the Bramble vest unto himself he's getting faded and by the W but it does allow you to go for the call and you can legally cash it on extra priority extra money that way. Having to try and earn yourself a solo kill which would have to come at the cost of your opponent choosing to do something there is a note to self but that's fine but I want you to consider cold
being sad let's see if u g can take down TSM or if it is Nick's for them in the standing less send it over to the catcher's how you doing I'm doing well the first game we saw Team Liquid at least move a little bit up in the standings are going to be tied for 6 at the end of this week with basically the whole week and then here we got to see if PSM can either be alone in her third or part of a huge five and five Thai people have computer to say they think the SMS temperature team in the league will see if their record Cancun reflect that and they'll be either one or two games behind second-place based on today's results Evil Geniuses name of high hopes for the four and five first round robin does not speak to it looks like Texadelphia and the first time these two teams played it was one of the closest gameKings of the split it was one ocean stole away from being away from being an open still game for Evil Geniuses actually win and based on the way grass of gone getting that first pick oranges got to feel good for kiss him I forgot what I was given this one yes Bank Freight late-game trundle you want to see it but I don't think of a pic they going to look at the Ezreal instead coming through you mean already gone so no, he's in there like threatening as a trundle we still could see you meme come in after the edge was already locked that's when the best Kitty ever quit PSN has every option. In the jungle 15K Dana 60 Minutes over all this stuff for himself early game in the LDS second obviously only to Cloud 9 but doing a lot of things well in the early game it's been since burning it that's been the problem for them yet so they can finish Run Around Back to Basics for TSM with another syndrome I feel like it just keeps getting pissed sooner by them every week it's their first pick on red side and here it is like you know what we once free games on Sandra already why not go for for this split and they lock it in really early really speak to me that is in his of 1 cup of pic I think he's very good in a day and I mean the leblancs syndrome matchup can be very explosive and he has had some very good LeBlanc as well as if you move to the block game so both these are going up against each other with their most picnic with tell me fun is very enjoyable to me as feta is out of the band fool and we'll see what else comes through DSM to figure out what what exactly do you want front of this cop there bot Lane is left I want to see a uni band here earlier on so I'm sure that's okay it looks kind of like so I think I got no worries that there is an unanswered jungle pool which is why the driver with your band practice to add on that one as well at least it ofcourse come through that are highly prized jungler in the one that bends during has paid but it's the job in argon from Israel would give them a strong little one as well as can improve team cutting which is veronese against the horn but I don't think he was going to see if so I would even though it's like pretty out of it what baby shivering the adrenal you look now I mean he at rest is also a little bit of face that you just do a bunch of crit I think I think it's almost like she never leave the meta and Eddie Vedder wear it like you have three. Enterica real lame pressure and they think they were all the as real Branagh some cases but you from ever recall. Alleyne I really don't like sedge when your major blach I don't think you need to take first does a round thing already I want some more explosive it is an interesting debate I think it's going to be two stage because it does give them a very very strong Frontline for the pokers if they would have basically been saying okay the other team definitely Up For Debate that's why I said you can stand up in the jungle is in to make it a second play the split here for the team TSM against fighting first place the wind tie for third with you got a very instant pot leave here at the triste are coming through York yeah I'm pretty excited to see Chris Eric I've seen an increase in Calista actually seemed a little bit of playing lck and I'm seeing a star to explode in solapur so I think told us that Eric will have a little bit of a come back because that also makes the initiation for the Tariff better but the trick here cuz you mentioned if they do window till aggressive they actually do it I don't see it happen I would like to see The Grand Tour come through think there's definitely the chance to do so she assumes new-look roster had a disappointing couple of years attended almost only knew one of LCS finals for like six years or something and then it was a catastrophe catastrophe kept shaking up the roster did Tim around though I think they have the play I can make it work the doll experiment with a huge question for a lot of people TSM look like you're an upward Trend I've been very impressed with our talks for the games and also from the sounds of it is attitude so far in the split it looks like even though there have been time for potential struggles for TSM it seems like they've been able to bounce back they've gone through such a weird he split already freaked they started O2 they've been had back-to-back 200 weeks into another 02 yeah and now we're looking for another two hours in fact both of these teams egn TSM are looking to find 20 weeks EG beating liquid earlier this week TSM. He's really this week and it's a big step forward with how compacted the middle of the standings are very important in this game really really big deals at Four Winds right now and then just outside of playoffs relief in a big tie for keep going you know between 6 and like 9th Place and and yeah we're at we're only halfway in and do close to determining which teams are in a route aside from probably Cloud 9 and CLG at 50 games choose one better than frog and Victor record that we flashed up in the last game was the 13 now I know this game is in the past but I didn't get a chance to talk about it in that game and there's not much happening this year the game and actually aside from last year we had Iran golden Guardians had a rough go in the NLCS there was a time where frog and actually had the lowest LCS win rate of any active LCS player like it was a tough first couple years for frogging but this year has obviously been more helpful for dignitas as they are sitting at 5 and 5 in currently tied for third depending on the results came and left listen for frog and his team TSM of course the same spot right here five and four puts them temporarily win percentage wise alone in third but that's not always a fair way to say things as well in their record really push to bot Lane go see it sends waves during expectation based on Champion much easier just a sin away of down I will say this. Try to meet Wednesday to spot people out the Rock coming and lost flash speaks volumes to bang not so obvious and also neither of these lanes were really thinking about killing the other team based on summer stuff so I can get some cryptic and chelated carry ignite biofrost but instead they did heal Tera teleport in Cary and on the other side you have you know a guardian bromwick exhaust so neither of those were like combat that's really level to power Spike that's not something where you wanted to bring to Summer spell soda sink down bought as you mentioned it back down anyway regardless though it's the first wave pushed in first couple levels pushed in 47 we'll see what happens to wav bounces afterwards as they finish pushing a mechanic to be in the top spot on his own side putting in a lot of damage on broken play around to everyone wears fence Karen has been this entire why call band biofrost Gusto Frehley rocket jumping in the chair like that that would be an incredibly risky move if darlock had invaded to spot on Spence Karen but I will stay there all that Vision. I've got on Spence Karen did not come with any kind of junk so is actually had what I'd call a successful first 3 minutes 45 seconds against we really can't stop you have to cancel ready and then ask for more than half as well if a trade blow a little bit low but has that during very early on a feeling it's really comfortable is a house is 1 CF but he'll be fine to hold the weight up with a stomach issue you can Jackson Trading back and forth to do Kay Whitmore CF but the more farm for Gibson to grab is he says he's been fleeced of the Wavin for me down by two. Pretty soon you could almost make us play biofrost you actually rolled up is what really enabled at play to take the Q in with the Terex done meant that the timing of Spence Karen / had to be incredibly precise if you flash too early then that erick's done and we soon will follow to kill for sure he had a flash in that Split Second after lease and landed and before the Terex done detonated really really close to first Wednesday night time is there a good play turns out this guy was nice and that's a flash down and took her inside to EG missing two classes so far the early game mostly on some pretty solid out place from TSM as the pot is pushed in and how big is not willing to freeze this if it's hard to freeze as Bristol get me wrong yeah but if you want to hold the wave on his side he could for about one way if I don't know no money 12:30 go to the parts of the wave if a non Canon wave the next wave coming in with the Canon Swift and for as much as we've had some close calls in the year of the game where Papa and biofrost for things / early and our talk with the biofrost real nearly killed Spence Karen Huger has not broken at all they have actually out Farm TSM a little bit in your looking mostly spent here and having a small gold beef and also Kumo just like getting to be set up in the top of the gun store and had that spiders and still nothing really have consequences happened early on in this game just a couple close calls started Making Waves clear effortless bank doesn't the TV to answer the TV that's all they had kind of pudding that's not much of a surprise down there if they trade blows then had to go for shein Delta stock this year defensively Dusty combat stats to battle the shoving really the Great Pumpkin Blaze solo kill I don't think I've seen it oh my I know that Orin has some really good kill combos is zelle free food some of them during the pre-show but that is not something that you expect to see shout out to Broken played on that nicely done. W cool down from Google to do KU campus to go back up let's go for round two flasks with the yeah it takes two to tango you got to do a big I'll plan orange but you also should be getting yourself killed on sat here he's fine he was fine right now right yeah I mean he had a fully stacked Concourse just enough Mana for the combo gets acrylic nice like prox21 and then she was like he was just as he actually he's the flash but didn't realize it hell yeah I lose you know down the 10% and then I'll be fine but there any time is up who is also very strong self righteous man are one makes you Bruno and then heading to knock up triggers brittle for like 2. Max Health family and that is TSM feeling pretty comfortable by the way he had such good first Blood
ballerina horses are owls which will come out on top of Team Liquid and dignity is it going to be one of those two sound effects make sure all right but we're asking me the owl rawr okay I mean it's okay we're the Champs select GM liquid 3 and 6 in the first round robin is has been a slow start but will be there to pick themselves up from here up against done reasonably well you're 5 in Forest. Cary band from dig they're just telling them hey dude will probably be linked dominant button with orn up you can see what they have to do otherwise it would just be a first pick and you don't want to give it over to attack humans up definitely a big deal fairy story of all the other like super duper powerpyx but it does have good if it's a late game damage outfit right when you're using a glass to live MSC now the ball is in his court to see if they want to do something about this off camera before the show started to play a certain way it is so good it's killing now and you also have to be very good at you that's what a lot of people underestimate like we saw a golden Guardians play at this week we're Keith didn't have a high amount of familiarity on the pic and didn't look good and this could be a game where you me actually just doesn't go through because of how powerful dose of ferrous in Misfortune will be that you may not be able to survive because I promised walk you can then pick you up against itself is not so all in heavy that MF will lose the layout of right so you work in the match up if you want to play it for JJ a career career support for the last four years but a career sport has place so they definitely want to see I want to go that way it will see what else comes through that you want he's up at least I mean every single double you care about is available that's what happens when you have such high priority have double 80 Cherry band in full SWAT Lanes early lost so how many calories in 4 sole Nerf and Away orange Soraka more and all the above and set it up. Thank you that's beautiful. How hard fans one of those rolls to get EZ Pass is still at 1 and feel comfortable regardless so they worth reiterating every single jungler finally leave and come through but otherwise every jungler is available I mean look at what has been locked so far for dig Pantheon is not particularly great late-game Champs I kind of thought coming into this game but it was going to be a slow one that has the lowest combined kills 4 minutes and that's one of the reasons for a lot of their loss but they're also with strong lady mechanics I completed one of General winds not necessarily think about much else just pick better looking than the other team already locked-in we'll see what ends up having to wait against because too much would essentially has to kind of wine both lanes or at least know that one of them might have to bring me the pantheon but a fake dislike give me a late-game junglers in a lake in the minute I think that would be their best to ask you this year so far pretty similar better than rocks are so far this year I give them the pass a little bit for now but they were just doing fine and I've really good late-game just come around to yell for the prefix aren't finding that Lake in position so I kind of see your point about hey drop some better team fighting yourself again game against the mail a dive of Pantheon Jarvan I think I could look pretty good as the dive is they aren if you would join the pantheon really goes into the store magic famous light makes me think that I don't know what pants that look like normally but they got to go in here cobroxin finally telling a second lease end game now his career then what he's been right now she's working late it is Brock so we send for sure it's in the best historical champion also think there's a good reason to Havasu 2014 top reasons but this is more about trying to keep up with early-game Jarvan with whatever type of early game power comes out from Kathy on but it's going to be so it's going to be difficult I feel like for Team Liquid to generate Camp Drive in daras to go with so I wanted to point out the Frog and Victor it's because an Orion Tab and he has five Oriana games and I have disowned like to say I like solving picture more because all their games related to a reliable they can damage soda good for one game behind second-placed standings now top two knife prop for the upper bracket in the spring fly off and that's a good start the guitarist in Striking Distance of that D liquid on the outside of playoffs right now they do need to shave but it's the second half of the split it got nine games to play every team wants to go to make it at least two games of rest of the pack to get in there and I can still foresee it happening if they pull things together I chatted with rocks are really quickly before this game is like it obviously sucks to get thrown in just waiting for the Swift but it also like before it's literally just look at fanatic last year when we start at 5 and we were able to improve from there so none of these players on Team Liquid black having bad starts in their past so all of them who pulled out of those bad starts and this might not be the game where they do it but I'm interested to find out that's find out right now we're on the road still looking fans baby Never Say Never these players should have the skills to get up there dignitas do have been a very pleasant spring split team so far winning record and then going to end this week 6 + 4 * 4/3 liquid the second time is who he is spotted out for the warded to try rush so they didn't actually no Kuni was in range to get hit by that prompt you not much doing there but that doesn't mean they will be able to scout the red side Jungle of TL something that is actually been working to Brock's his detriment and it looks like it's going to happen again this game is it really does feel like all of his early games have just been on top of words whether it's TL not blocking for him properly in the early game or whether his jungle paths are getting scouted doesn't really matter just matters that he's constantly seen so it's one of the reasons his games have they mentioned in the temp like he's got a very very worst for the game jungle stats in the league 3 games the first jet lag when he gets part of the past but his goal differences you got zero was across the game so far like it has not been a good start for him and and a lot of the reasons heal picked him up was hey can we want more cramping in early and want more dominance we want this happened and now that box into a second career I want to start seeing that out of him and never was going to have their own opinion on how much they're going to give Team Liquid in terms of success or failure but I do think people are generally under estimating the difference between second week with the jungler versus second week with the jungle when everyone else done beef sticks to fax it if you would have been here at the start of the split every team would have been coming together and building Synergy but Team Liquid is already behind the rest of that already is it okay to just really hard but they're going for a nice done for whom plastic you and he does so it in Brock's a level 2 of horse did have the E for the slowest was just the Q vs The Reflex play Now That Booty is Flash was trying to play aggressive and Pantheon is going to be extra extra risky brick finishes his first for Camp stop side need to run into a river is well and knows that leaves him isn't around but you have rocks on Ross and still end up topside so at least it is always only 10 seconds away or action and actually boss Aziz to trade each other our break was directly reveal and those fries with self gave away a box of lies and great losses out probably both got us here because Jackie was pushed up in the mid lane sabrosky take that but the fact that they both met Top Lane means Brasa can very easily go Scuttle to Scuttle as Grinch tries to clear crunch Skelaxin doesn't have a mass amount of experience so it's not to start dancing weed but it's a nice thing to be able to do as a jungler and right now who needs help with no top when they don't know if he is unwilling to fight for the wave until Greg is there this have tails impacted bring up a package outside yeah and impact cast The Flash to fly but weirdly enough who needs a guy who will just pushing the waves in a bad position was another son was there was also a f--king the way for the last 45 seconds while Blake Blake Gregory went to crowd and who he's sitting there in that brush like a waiting for a jungle out there to think that he's like thank you for finishing to have to contact the Wavin now too much needed him at some point bedtime story about that interaction am I should bring up just jumped in the way of the first time or was braastad being top River make that two scary with a two-on-two is back to give up like a wave and wait till they leave and pass them or else and then shove it is I think early-game least that is just through scary if you're flat that's my guess it's also Greg and the situation where we talked during his first game this week actually about how like there is the two different versions of Greg there's the one where he is kind of a slave to his lanes and not doing his own thing versus the one where Greg is able to go around and make aggressive calls in like the toppling situation with some burning is really flash and making sure he stays on top side like he needs to be up there for the later protection Academy on just go over to lease in a start it is advantage raksha and what he's been able to do on the next do results come through we do not wholly have to burn his flash first which means impact flash comes in later so we might see Russian toppling a live it down the line top link for push back for it impact your overall farmlead is with the set to be a 300 gold bead on TL overall some of that midline otherwise a little little bit in top with Restless wave when we Farm does everything is pushed down a well at level six lights in room soon could see an old boss Lane is his teleport is also available at the bridges. Okay thank you accused three of them right it's not Google this is so much gold moved into the mini and Museum Prague that if you're going to be problems kind of want to stick around there good Wars ikumi again Brasi ever get to push in that you're able to get down the river go wardrop artifact gun glitch for recall it is okay you saw me past hopside I probably recall here but maybe I walk run for the Outfield to give you a go for a lane didn't you never know for sure it takes me a second but it creates a little bit uncertain on the opposing side Johnson they're actually needed to teleport back to Lane for the tempo double it should already been able to get off a good BF store recall and had made it back and Lane so we'll have no teleport for a rift Herald swap play that's always the small victory you're going for if you're not taking the teleport Bob hunter that you're trying to get that teleported out before the objective spiked combat more left with your W and now it's a look that is so Riggs first and then threatened with that bubble to find play definitely could be pushed back
we're diving the Champions like the first band to the table so we're going to send it back over to freaking us out for game to thank you very much freaking Avail is right there I am freaked and we have a 540 record up for us here somehow I knew you were going to do that as well and maybe I can fight or flight from South Orange is bad so the most obvious respect is not around but that is often very good chance that definitely is very very strong is going to be set for a second look like and I forwarded it could be popping out of traffic but I hear it so hotBeatles first draft stand or not I'm not certain what do not be surprised if the first Pixar the good actually very very reliable pick up all the same and so yeah we can kind of talk about what's happened with these teams I actually am very intrigued by this. That that was what brought a piano app that switches that Immortal spends more time behind than ahead I got the record of Silent for there a winning team they are tied for third baseman more time behind ahead they have a negative gold difference over the league right now like the overall at their phones game more gold than they have but they have they have lost a really intelligent veterans on the team who have been able to figure out ways to win games from difficult situations and sometimes it also can be kind of a compelling Point as well because one thing that I think has a bad job if you don't look at like more context is if you win quickly and Lou slowly you like yes we got ahead and then we close the game out in 22 minutes we're really with a decisive and if we lose a minute we make you fight for it like we fight tooth-and-nail we won't fall over or so good either side of my back while you were behind for 35 minutes and you're only had four eight arguably were actually get right inside like yeah I'm not sure that's a little behind but they're finding wins mckaley fairly quickly when they are I think the only kind of argument against haven't had a lot of most of the Winds and people that I immediately think of the DLC gameplay they're losing the whole game they lose it the soul than they bought this back door right and what should have been an enormous lyrics where they pull off this one big fight with a little turn things around and make something happening and that does deserve credit right that is a skill in and of itself being able to kind of manipulate your way out of these difficult situations and and find ways to it of course they are coming off a two-game lost streak right here on the immortal side they had recently gotten four in a row which was good at kind of kind of like the top of the standings and so I am very curious I think almost exactly how high do all this team stack up when it when the records are so close together it is very hard to tell like definitively who is who is actually better than than whom and right now it has a lot of good and worth mentioning that 10 wins has never missed playoffs in alsea is not a mathematical walk 459 but if they win today history would suggest there in playoffs and I don't think that's going to be a big star branding one it is kind of cool to know you're not that far into the playoffs would be pretty insane where a lot of the time there's such as Shuffle you want to drop off quite a bit but they are still on for this is actually the been a 18 Nerf patch what are the things that I really want to because you're getting a lot less goals 23 one more light on heels on trading on these type of things you actually get to the same level that you had before in the ALCS my feeling and Bentley what I observed is that they were just left Brady and way less fighting compared to eat Missoula few of these types of things so I'm expecting send it to be hit much more heavily in Pro play where it is at fensive then it was in so that's why I wasn't expecting to see Santa as an easy as a turnabout Lane Marksman write my was executive order support is anything still will be in to see how to 40% a little bit of a more hybrids play style I would do Academy played tennis started as kind of the support for a while in pain like partially shared Farm in the galley of player was kind of going a half way and we've seen a different game works and it was the hardest before it was paired with a farming or that you're still the damage was coming from Spain. But she was like harassment telling to see how the concepts of the tomten farm here we have to leave for the Tomkins is the farmer that you're the game I don't expect that to be the case to Standard Market support stuff as the mid lane as well obviously that is on the table but I do think you're fairly good match of just that it is something we're right it's not that bad of yours going to dominate you but I think vitamin was going to stop for the same reasons I think Kayla Kathy Wendy's Champions are good and that's because if you free to formally where's that cannot punish you widen your Casio KL Champions are just worth more later in the game but I do believe it is one of those matchups but with me at least getting locked in alongside that there is more of an opportunity to try to attack the Vladimir early at the bottom are left in you would expect to lose any sort of Scooby-Doo that it's like even late up on that top side so the pressure I think so as already and on a committee to put licorice down in the early stages otherwise they're going to feel the wrath of Vladimir later on and they're still the one percent chance to meet up lad still goes to mid-length I got to be respectful of that pencil for life of wine piggish midliner but should feel comfortable against the glass and I'm going to be first plane that was different and so he will answer here in bed have a lot of blonde braids damage but it will hit the floor Jelena or this diet or whatever so it is going for a flight Flight Support more reliable on the side of a mortal definitely when you have that work on that is kind of your go button link up with your Jana Immortals Tom speak very have lead to wanting to see if I Do by B5 to find that engage jump on it, like that's gonna take him down for the Zoey tur pick them off I do think cloud 9 is going to have to be a bit more creative about their engages try to find opportunity for they can for somewhere else to fight them poking out with Joey and then looking for follow up on that boat with a getting engaged or flank them from you resend Vladimir these types of the stories we also have to always remember that you can play freestyling with Vladimir especially when paired how long is Dennis the Comcast you get an eighth for a difficult situation that's been all 10 from the time and I'll do rotations coming through from the top Consulting turning one you want into a 3D one may be taking down that sets Queen the game to fix games now on Leesville across 10 game time start for cloud nine these everyone's favorite for best jungler in the LCS right now for us with a lot of waiting Lanes a lot of skilled players not much of a surprise to have that happen but honestly Cloud9 been rewarded with the opposite of the best mechanical place I've seen in the LCS ever and he has really pulled off some special stuff and is shining truly in his first full-time starter as it as if I'm not here to see him growing the first team to stop the Cloud 9 season if you want to let you know that could do it I think they have gotten a lot of artifact results so far I think they can be very creative. So as talked about music for Who need another creative player I think I need some people are attracted to be very good here for a mortal sin that goes come through if by some kind of his decline of play the real quick though got Gabby said about 3 thank you so much free I just wanted to get some words from you before we head into this game first of all 900 going into the second half of the regular portion is there anything different in your approach once that happens I'm not real that's what I figured as much because a lot of the pics that you're coming through are very similar to the first half one different thing I want to know is Vladimir so how do you feel that he's going to be able to do in the Top Line especially if there is a focus from the other team probably the Chris gets pushed in 24/7 and skis getting out later team. He was crushing everything but I'm probably rough for him so yeah we'll see him fighting that Immortals are definitely going to try and insist upon here I don't think you did to us all right well that's words from Reaper let's head back in the game I had are awesome fast to check stuff out for me the first player to play a champion six times this flip me is the most recent one trick of any player but scroggin and I actually probably more pics to re-fix on their mostly chance they can't I take anti for the six acts but one of my library is very much about plainly spent and had to put a water I think he also does have a lot of other Champions that he can bring it to the next one appropriate but hey at least in very strong the matter right now they loved hearing it alongside the AP till later and is that your some of that Insight from RI. It's pretty much larger back in and I was talking about with Vladimir hey you just tomorrow and out Daly look at more done later on we'll have to track thing with and that really do you know Bronco identity Sandcastle is on the legacies CW Auto in there as well pick that one up and we'll keep the track going over the course of time to fight Lane is being pushing and I want to point out by the way that it's Tom Kent store in Spring it's been going for the sickle-cell you know it is very harassed Baisden and it's been trying to stack up letting both get the mine and I actually really like that's right because I do think that you need to make these adjustments you just won't have souls intro play if all you're doing is one you need to be harassing so then going for the sickle really cool adjustment they're going to be stacking that up by harassing me to be stacking up your souls from brassing around the time that you have to complete that support item I am assuming he's gonna start picking up way more of the farm lipstick on a scale there this is going to make Vulcan much more of a true tank in that front line cancel for A to B to going on here around Midland Smithy driving around all right if they could you look up a fish be stolen Sumner there so was he able to use to kill. Not much worse aircraft another heel for himself now since he do patents that stops it is going to be spotted out in this tribe but there is potential for some sort of a place is beyond cruggs now and is aware of where it's nippy is thanks to that wore that we are seeing rate down at the bottom of your right there beside the golden buzzer medium frog will not force the deepest part of the camp so just be a very minor amount of gold the next be available to apply for fever walked up there I think that he's known to be around to see if licorice can like see him at this point he's and didn't rain so we got to fight the bottom sides nice shop for Vulcan in that goes over this is really funny what is a way to actually see them continue to play this dick that is so good for that yeah oh wow you know kind of dressing to the changes that were made in the little reminiscent of kind of like Persona Terror type stuff that we had seen the past where you're putting a lot of farming support release get them very strong obviously they can't do the double to four items because they'll actually be no cut off and look at this. Minute we're giving my 2 month olds in the farm though your Vulcan will be way behind on the bicycle that is something that is going to come out and I'm not even sure if woken is going to feel the sights on this evening to call for the back now you got to be here as well and it cocoon goes on to spend on his trunk by book a ticket for this done all the time or they're always right the safety so pretty easy walkway to see nice to be able to back it up just good positioning I think from the two voltages trying to have it at war that sleep was really post on Oslo who could have been in trouble if that did Landon up here on this job site again it This Is War trading but especially with phase rush you can beat down the flat Amir a bit but he can actually keep his distance steel back up with a concentration fusions and really just play this earlier events it because that's why I'm here as long as you're farming okay and you're staying alive if you're getting more than just a standard pick up which is doran's ring even if you don't need the memories and it's still gold efficient ability power and I really really want so I'm going to see a lot more than over time and same thing for Holly as well it's just one of those things is also really nice about that lobe 888 me fairly hard actually know last hit sometimes on this Champion having the door into the extra damage on that is going to make it easier to last hit five day passes on basement back to those who just bought an item makes your life easier so as to shopping in The First Tee Pee is burning and licorice has the first price that you really care about the armed guard is in making play Tanki and now we're putting out he's only fighting visible damage from so I don't like to buy I think it's I think it's a little bit weird when you're building new HP and you're going to be against the least you can come in on Monday yes it is very effective is your only against that sat in stomach killing their cvrs is very effective boat in the one you want to go
for this weekend I want to see a strong Team Liquid or if they're running out of time for excuses exactly I'm going to I'm going to keep it appraised apologist for everything up until now not there and then week for was with a jet lagged rock that has been there for over a week and I know that practiced has been cut short because he hasn't been there but turn it on for this point on this is PL there are no more excuses you simply must play level your opponent I think for this EG standing is a great first test if your be as good or remotely as good as they were last year they should women that they really should write they should be riding for the top of the inning through this is a veritable cast of All-Stars call fro across every roll a spliff are you lie beside great upgrade what everyone called look at 4 to 5 but stillexpectation for Fantasy what kind of a showing they want to bring us a lot of talk was about how process coming in with splits make Gilmore practice that was the preseason just got done talking about wanting to Flame more around the school of Brockton Jensen enable Jensen who is known as the strong later to be aggressive because that had them one of the criticisms Levi towards him is that people felt get started to play a more active role compared to in play with the time on 590 the change the most aggressive that would have converted list of course in a lot of ways to keep on the TL Type-S double it's important that you know what your text was down here in North America and and hold off on the world stage in defrost a paradise for them. But yeah I'm looking for volatile exciting it supposed to TL and Tom Cat gin is kind of not thatmovie two-lane Advantage be as being created in the LCS this split literally demolished the Aldi's bought Lane and on the other side of fear as real going to be the lock-in I am very interested to track the performance of EG overall to because we saw this. Earlier today from diesel talking about the differences in play style differences in mind steps to become the players and mainly bang a suitcase for going to offset play style to an end all processes they want to see in parts has poor man stealing and come and play for them or doesn't matter which side you pick you have to be there United together be on the same page have the same game plan and look 2x coupon that because the easiest well has a very talented players displaying I think far below what most people defecate in the word for the squatmake it onto looking at us actually on the easy side bangs with credit still has a very high Katie and she has a lot of damage there as well so he's Steve Perry when the rest of these is not quite coming together we do coordination is a big issue here for the EG side and and you hope that some of that out in a second phase of pants you got top Plus in powerbot lights. Principles by Ray dalio Sia Barrett so it is being moved on to hear but I am of the opinion that actually in this place them in lck I think is really really good folk as Elena and as the added utility from the high damage in team fights off. Is incredibly valuable in throat and allowing someone like rocksyou have an advantage over his opponent get that extra until his try to make moves with it though I'm glad to be asked back on the audio stage 2 normal slime play Katy Perry roar like a can easily flexpet born into mid we know or complain that lane Ford Azucar and something else to the counter to set later on as at least come through a bit late in 40 liquid kind of looking like it is going for at the game plan that I was talking about earlier where would be perhaps playing around a little bit right we don't know what the last pic is here for gentle but they are saving him counterpick they have a very dominant religion jungler which is the least stable side lanes and that does leave you to play pay maybe they want to try to get something done around Vivid there was obviously the cat do in Denver band in Phase 2 coming out from Heattrying to prevent us they may feel are going to be difficult or just do k e r he has been a big story saint of a good walk band I wouldn't be surprised the eyes of those come out so it does make sense that it something that it's pretty hard to exploit husband have so much to say Si Vous Play some very very far back and looked at this Farm the wave you're in an ad the 70 this matchup so what we find coming out here from Denton yeah and also it continues to emblem eyes look exactly like we're at least as well as the fourth be back in and that means we are going to hope to see some aggression in lipid I think that your point out the various pumpkin plane from last week Ashton Finch has can have some. You're not looking that are really high end gameugly with your laser no actually using to ask that sit behind the minions feel the folks over the back end of those reins Minions on Tuesday try to whittle them down as a combo obviously not as powerful as some of that almost but if you can start with f in the gravity field will have time to charge up and lock them down for additional safety afterwards that can be quite strong fights in general just staring at them like Zoe forward a little bit but I remember the team as long as you're not able to plank a lot of the ability is coming out of her ass right there's going to be a lot of artists on double if you be able to hit that can be problematic when there is Champions League draw moving stand in front of pop up the unbreakable sure if I'd be able to block that on the other side I think he has incredibly reliable in Humble Juanita from there for follow-ups fishing for sleepy bubble trouble I would say that backwards from a lot of different ways to do in Israel and then when you get someone both utilize all of the hard engage that they have to commit to it seems like for cl to take that whereas I think I'm looking more for 4 Pics Boling Vision and utilizing things like the Alise in the Victor to come out of fog and try to take someone out all right vs Skirmish and vision control MTL side let's see you can do it the battle at 3 and 5 this closes out the first round robin the ALCS 2020 spring split Evil Geniuses and Team Liquid teams that were hyped to start off of what is starting out 3 and 6 sorry I just got to follow but no habla gated so interesting to know a couple of times actually over on TL side they want to have options to be able to respond to the CC but also for core JJ especially to be able to actually step for potentially in a team fight and tank us as one of the ultimate cleanse that out and then kind of a step back for Jensen he is going to have a gun both for the sleep from Zoey as well as from that engage from son scared just to stay safe and I will gang since you fighting so interesting stuff there are you can see that is going to spell book on the orange some milk bottle players have been liking to play with if you're looking for any potential kill pressure in Lane swapping City tonight later on for tutus or even for the potential 21 can be really really effective not right now the one to be one as being one by Kumo hit the cue he he live the perfect full combo for level with orange shoe Landon is really irrelevant you know he's due back and Jensen and said this is not very good in Danish liquor which I'm sure would follow translate to health and happiness or like good luck and happiness something like that champion yeah I can see that I mean in general like failure to steam fairly Nordic so I can see that it's really coming through at 6% Sewanee I'm sure you know she speaks the language itself yeah alright so you can speak to mow just this is because he actually wants to start with refillable Farm up enough gold and in general you will Salvadoran shield from there because you cannot buy health potions and refillable everything when you're already out on the bath this is a pretty common start you want to avoid trading generally before you actually do have the gold to complete your first item though and I want to be a little bit different but they're really bad end of a trade there before the trade. Write my forces were damaged Right Punch again and so I should get an even higher damage, but expected popping up for generally more careful tonight until you actually have the door into deal if you don't really want to expose yourself to trade in your actually did cost him both of us were filled with ocean charges very early on but unlikely to be able to get those with Karen up your boat. oh haven't even had a Smite out of just like you got it either way all right well might use on one side of the cube comes down and rock bands playing that one so nicely done by Zeppelin camps established just sit back out and he's just going to be able to pass the straight on down to that second scuttlebutt lamp Rio is theirs and sincere and was sent back towards beso will be a double Scuttle start year for broxah can you feeling pretty good getting Vision on both sides of the map for the squad took to be a little bit careful though he's cheating down towards him and doesn't had actually got up pretty early recall off there still look like that a lot for the day without a lane pulling toward but I'm always very compelled by interesting match-up text like it's little and yeah I do a three-way 7 to do something cuz it's too long to make those kind of place do you have to like have a full shove for going to go to recall to be worth it and even though you take cpf the time there shortly and you can do these timing backs but that give you break one of them yeah an Ender becomes this kind of mind him around it right you know if you are actually committing most of your minutes is trying to push out this way then your phone and scan can actually prevent it from fully briefed settings and all of a sudden you can get stuck in laying with no manners and it is pretty bored to be able to get those kind of Harley recalls off for Victor because ever since they actually did change the cost on that on the X4 upgrades it is very difficult to actually save up enough for you to have a man has day and Lena whole time we purchase that up so if people often want to get an early recall go back and get the more items that can help bridge that Gap and get them to work different upgrade Dumbledore in Springfield the Mana regen as well as K1 going pretty Cozy Coupe with a bit of ecstasy is left on the field of invented to the most likely to have a nice little bubble butt and a better manifold as well yeah and just out of range of the door there was his UK Sublime pretty well and he's really trade up a couple Farm as an advantage the impact of a little bit of farm did already get his face off knock it off to expend until 4 so that is a pretty significant Advantage 40 L I U want to see them now playing towards that Dragon I think they should be challenging for that when you have PPO dentist up on that spot side to be an almost guarantees take as long as they can execute well look for that to come through then pretty soon ice mechanic Sportscore but he feels pretty safe there as well as guardian is now it's bigger than they're just find a seat to go back and forth. Lee fight coming through again is a lot of course Lane control unit it's not resulting in a massive Gold Leaf that has actually gone to TL in all three lanes all three lanes from TL it felt like Siri will to get a preferential recall timing and we thought they'd be still and double if he's playing at the TV Azrael he actually already got a base off and it's still up in farms that's feeling pretty good for them it's been staring though looking for potential wraparound gang cure but they do know at least is in the area so he doesn't have just kind of checking on that infernal thing to do with her. so tell me the things we fight continually in the top and side and back blocks away from the auto attack after the W lancets we're about half the payment that smell comes from essential East the actual British lamp so there you can see the 8S vs difference as you mentioned to your winning a little bit 8 full length of got to feel pretty good part of my mind still thinks that I'm afraid of the Alise person sidhwani difference as time goes on I got to watch the match ups or reasonably close but if it's a lynx rankings like that money is really happy to trade Farm in a matchup like this where police has so much priority over you in the early game I don't think you should Commit This trying to feel this at all happy few disadvantages back is not even
completed the first round robin and sadly these are two of the very bottom jeans EOD alone in last black West hydrate a relatively Rock run at it and they're needing to find Improvement the last Fusion Academy game I cast with actually against liquid Academy and they had so many opportunities to win versus like Zoe who grabbed a chilling Smite off a minion to steel dragon soul need to find ways to generate the trees but I'm looking forward to watching black West because like personally revenge is a player I have my eyes on all along with triple like those stolen or triple for being that great opl import revenge is because she was like any solo queue star from a couple years backgo to say was already like half so far already playing a he was playing up from Canada with you notes you know 55. Ready to take it to the second round robin let's goLil Boosie celebrity like I'm through a couple games ago and do it a lot of times Academy metal will end up pre-empting LCS met a little bit curious you going to get your thoughts on what atoms approach to be with you but I kind of funny cuz when I was casting FaceTime games we started seeing you and then I'm like it's kind of weirdly like refreshing to see you again cuz it's different and then after watching the games I like and that was fun we won't be seeing you again right yeah you also way more bands and pick us rocket would like the number to Hyatt present stop later at like 75% pick ban right it was 6 pick up game just just pick like once every 18 as well as another MF models do with a fight Up Against Time and people wanting to matches with like an H rocks or more for mordekaiser it's like this fine Night Champion pool that are at least not a counter but like serviceable and Orange Ranger locking it in early and then they're also making sure they're locking in there Duos cuz it seems like the jungle and support pools are by comparison actually smaller but I called the wrong Poppin Poppin bought bought pools are smaller than Jungle pools so they're more okay with the jungle absorbing a second phase of a baby like set is that extra tier above the organ that like that like that Dennis first alarm Jack weirdly Ya Head Up Pretty Ricky like almost never make both through you're going to do take that you're okay and we're going to go fight that with more damage and they're always Banning or is that it just ends up that you know only one is ever available LG side-by-side Emma share with us and he's above their bot Lane in this regard to take a look very good I have been I have a car payment plan for when I'm going to spoil here because you're awesome I don't necessarily like people staying like after his at least you cried this game Let's watch this highlight reel compressing are and sure and he's like yeah whatever your carpet else are like the important thing is press are at the right time like sure are is really powerful and sometimes it feels like you can just swing by pressing on but it has a very steep win rate increase as MMR increases as cartas is incredibly still expressing the pet for this is there's a playtester who was really good of carthus last season and really knows how to Jungle him and I had Kim record a note Schleich practice tool full clear he didn't in 3 minutes and 4 seconds is a mattress I part so he's place give me different 130 by the way I like a side-by-side comparison I talked about called I was going to talk about all the like Auto or Auto tax in you need to tap your e so you're not bringing too much Mana but also watch I was prepping this I went back and looked at all the folk artist game it is pretty rare that you actually get a full clear on karthus cuz either this is what I seen actually either the carthus will start at enemy Red and then take Raptors and then like Zoom through is jungle to get like a hard tonight cuz he's still fast or the other team will preamp the invade because they know that no one can keep up with the Carthage pool clear and also to do the proper car this will clear you get pretty low so it is a little bit vulnerable based off of this open though maybe we'll get to see frog races for clear and we can we can time it I got some break points in my head for what like good looks like I'm ready to see them when I come through. If this is the if this is going to make them as well so it looks like he's going to keep key if he's doing it right he'll make it to this part of the river by 2:15 so let's yep let's let's get this going on karthus all right it's 1:30 and I know an LCS cool down I don't like can you navigate to Target dummies in and use their opening else I want Cartman Speedway how fast can you get level 5 you can gain Time by cute you can Skittle the crop as the blue is almost dying and you should actually be pulling the Grump down towards his Lowe's right now and already have a Quick Queue on the walls let's let's see if I'm just full of it though because he acted like I saw a spirit and a jungler he was in mid lane by 2:15 done so this is it still good but he's about four five seconds behind awesome 526 seconds slow and he has a challenger levels at Academy jungler yeah we'll see it it looks like it's going to be doing a full clear unless you really want to try and go into River early so three or four is really fast I think like the house miscue I think like the fastest theoretical jungle Carthage clear is 3 minutes exactly or 259 optimal Optimus light is on Redbox Redbox has the highest Mr of any meaningful jungle Camp you're going to kill frogs have met Mr Probz do you spell damage is super high on those already and then you're finding things like what was the Raptors you're already a UE in the big one so much what you're eating your cues that like it's already at 300 house by the time you're back at the school 3:12 full clear by carthus if you noticed it's like literally a fulcrum Camp ahead of what this is wanting to do and that means you can beat level 4 in River where is his wanting to level three I guess whether a recent Academy Carthage game last week as well and this is the start and then the jugular Gamespot gank top and by the time you recalled had caught up in farm and like the camps for a second because you often get very very low as you finish my sack and they will kill you was able to safely kill the boss battle took that one took the recall gets the CD are a few items and is going to be at prom about the time to respond so I'm so far from the jungle. How's the flash really like not one but that is Flash. That's the cost right now he's up a camp for the flash but it's going to get a lot more than that cuz now the Krug the Krampus responding to the carthus and he's going to be able to cycle level 6 really quickly so then if ask him if he was like still finishing his Top Lane gang can like which one he had like caught up in Pharma now so he's two camps ahead going over the chicken and is going to be no problem and then you start getting free time so much faster is near Louisville to clear if I just take a minute total and is a 2-minute respond now on your second do you have a full minute to go do what you want to do check for top Scuttle that one's already gone chickens are up there but you know something is worth it yeah I'm thinking that maybe the power firm jungler is making a comeback yeah that's kind of my games Theory and I was the biggest discrepancy between regions that I could find actually is so like lck junglers vs if 15 is about 10 higher than everywhere else in the world so like the bunch of mechanics like they're it's not a can of waiting for its binds him right like they are actually he's about 10% less because they're getting less and they're using that time forming you can get into this whole like what is actually optimal but like if Farm jumping is actually really good then that would be good for Korea shatter hurting on it is diving into any given the game I guess I should be like is what I say a couple times a year is the game beyond the game right like you did say things that Carlos is mad at people are playing carcass and that's accurate but I think there's more interesting version of better game is for the Korean metagame is hard farming jungle so when you see a green juggler if they're going to have more Siesta mean when the Middle Ages are picking champion and playing Lanes out and talk plans to take a chance like things out there with the expectation that they're not getting ganked as much sooner that you know they're not good with and sew a direct One V one is more important in the Korean medic this could have been if they had more bottling pressure in early Dragon take by for August. 6 at 6:30 which is pretty darn fast that's the one thing that's weird with his composition like I love everything except the Casio the Casio is really good for Dave's in their game against liquid I think Environ is set to but now do I also like one thing I like Taco Cartridge for is literally that can let you have AZ everywhere else and the teams don't have to do them are now you're letting to be a lot more efficient with their purchases and turns Red Sox is for sure going to look for the early text drink to her a towel or something and actually survives the top way in about 240 nicely what is dammit Pravana sure that play for the good times that he ends up getting killed himself that's the way that I see that plate like it looks like he smashed him up until this point absolutely destroy him Lance everything q1w Q3 which is often the most seats right there I thought he was dead but he can do after flash turn back and that's when James gets 16 with the ultimate that is everyone's face in that play am I doing yep did it took a dark Harvest I don't think no rips who is it for I mean it could have been like a late on Revenge but know that I was like way later than that
sadly have filled and lit games a lot they have nearly taken down swings and they've gotten turned around either way but it's still going to be fun to watch for if they can attack and then hold on to the game with all these players are Dark Horse brand new to the LCS topside their first games were just last week and they're going to keep going for here will any of those at the board Galley also follows kind of scared strategies and this this chair champion pool does get taken out early on in the first draft days actually I will I will give you upI think this is going to rise a priority do on super drunk Lane matchups individual match up there so there's this might actually give a nice advantage over 284 to pick your breather tube mate or someday I would prefer that they save it for Sunday actually it's montoya's played very versatile roll either running around with a demon it was one of those aggressive pics or also being able to play orianna in somebody's control Mages I think he gets overlooked in that aspect of passed through through a looking at Niles game so far he's been really high Farm junglas where if you don't listen to you but you take more camps that's okay you're still doing really really well Champions like Thalia and Graves at least it's not that brings the gun is when he played it earlier but it'd be at least like that is a get stuff done for your team kind of champion is kind of in between the two where they can just feel reasonably wellopen things like a redacted possibly in the top way that's the big thing to me Renekton still went through champ select here and we're talking about strong lanes that is one of the strongest that you can pick as why can't a couple as well he's actually wanted to get into that super early on his face though I don't think they they necessarily need to Niles of course don't for the grave or a note for the gang you at one point was a gangplank one-trick so that's still available so very high priority if you have an Italy pick your though I think you kind of need to deny Renekton cuz no matter what. I was fixing that case is going to be under too much pressure already these Basics update one of the best I've got the best top laner endoleaks if you have to baste a Renekton Italy combo and that is pain that is going to be a lot of pain it is so set gets locked in now brakes this Shield so if u w 1st to get pretty screwed it is a fakefrom who you know what can be played pretty complicated support or in topland I'm still a big fan of set-top limited it is quite good there's nothing that we defected to see that you know you okay this is more of this and it yet you know it's kind of like Lee Child Support so will drop the GP off right now okay let's see what else they want to whittle down here on Niles honestly maybe the gragas sit one of those safer fix watch regeneration four-lane gragas roaster priority and Top Lane as one of the general is fixed because she does so much damage and so you can push waves and get harassment a lot of these melee matchups what's a super safe with body slam you could always save it for either engaging setting up with your jugular for 6 rate disengage to along with the ultimate Being Sober quotes out if you know like you're postulating this is a support set rotation here that they pick past you know it looks like a hundred thieves definitely think I'm on those lines I prioritize that have been more I support right now let's see what I lacked with final report will be the Dallas Stars with my inclination here as well although he is one of the players will actually plug-in chanter supports forever does so you're never safe Franklin Lane out you're in bed playing like defensive Ciroc with Relic Shield of that doesn't feel very good so it is just take bands going away delete allister up that is an easy snap peas 1 record have been limited to do that and then save the rest for counter and indeed they say you are so excited here mate on a collie everyone always talks about Demonte yeah you know he's this loic on Mid laner not good at Lane matchups always runs for the team that's what makes them good I love seeing him on Assassin's melee Cari Champion if we get to mate here on the akali some some early pressure you get it for the level six comfortably that is so fun to watch Lilia is a great Target for a colleague afelius is an amazing Target for a college 100% of 0 we got the set that can move around so now I'm partying have their lineup in the out to go to the thing is for sure that I acted is one of the very few counter picks because it is so precarious if a protected get that early Gakuen protecting gets even though the owl play early on on the Quints and blows Summoners and even just something as little as the cleanse is blowing like a level 1 or something like that that would be hugely detrimental to the Quinta Quinta needs to play this match up very offensive Lee you constantly push the redacted off the waves oradexon can't build up rage you get your brush control everything comes with playing aggressively it for the Quin side if you lose that then you lose the entire point of the pic so a lot of your team play has to also revolve around that you know jungle pathing as well as wording but bad I love it the confidence to we are talking about iconic in the intro but also Niles came into the ALCS there like you don't want we're coming straight from Collegiate skipping Academy everybody doubts us everyone things were hard place to farm really well in week number one tactic when he's going to try play aggressively is going to try and take it to some day good luck it's going to be a lot of fun Niles has planner there of course has a long-standing history playing alongside I caught played in Maryville for quite a while with stop gofer jungle poaching and get a lot done there on the Lily we'll see how we can write The Closer on is Italy but we are on the Ripper this one it's going to be a fun one to watch for once again hundred these pinlock first place in their group those records are swept by the way how the thieves are two-in-one they locked first send a group with a win here Golden Gardens typing wanted to they are already guaranteed to be in the playoffs themselves that they beaten CLG but they can't I T L these Auntie sent it two wins and find ourselves in a high-speed as a result depending on how the games go without waiting now for the first place that's appreciate it let him get the w2w instantly clear set of an owl statues of the knock back there I'm able to defend his Ward plus get a nice lead and Lane it's going well already freaky on Sunday you have no reason to walk to that brush their they let you like really really trying to make the wave push like you you can play it from a different side and you know what does not loop after health bar but as it is dial just playing very far up he is denying Farm in pretty back for a little bit but so far so good up there it's about like half past your screen to spend it depending on your resolution and what you play at so it's going to be different for everybody but that was out of range for experience when he got them up to the base of the truth are so now it's a plane it's really well at the opening as you said someday playing a little bit so carelessly they're taking the extra trade of chunk of damage. I'm going to trade you should get anything with the minions but he is getting real squishy already if you work through the potion and Whittle down already the Renekton that takes away so much of the threat even of the game, topside you know both junglers are looking at this matchup has the most of the entire map that does hinge very heavily on gangster what kills Alex message text Quinn not running teleport because she has to run twins to get out of the combos first translate here often times makes a difference but someday Canon minion wave stacked up in here for Niles so he's able to earn with the pressure he put out already safety himself and that will buy time for iconic to finished his clear on Lilia what you absolutely love with a Chance again you want your full clear first before you start interacting with the Lay's then you can easily and cautiously get to your Scuttle crab pick up so honestly really good start here for the conference for Golden Guardians what about the mid lane damage to Face by Sunday could have you know - W-2 because if you did anything at all you just lose the entire way but that works cleanse to get out anyway exactly that the cleanses the big kicker here you're not going to get that kill on the first pass and so you're giving up more than a single wave there was an extra minion in addition to the Candy Man and so I'm pretty sure they were almost late so yeah so is a huge amount of gold that you're giving over in an attempt just to burn the summoner's put to give up your positioning and probably take damage on the way back Sunday walking from the bakery in the body slam iconic what bear is the thing like you was there they could have gone for Bodyslam your like Silver Eyes baby if I put her something but decided now it's not the flight when do the interesting things to do to track in League of Legends or aggravating depending on your point of view is the priority of CC abilities because some CC abilities will override others braccus is at the top of the list for almost over writing all forms of other gases and CeCe abilities if you body slam you gain priority maybe it's cuz he's such a big boy you definitely interrupt Alistar W so there's no way you should ever be getting destroyed by it and I'll start there that's one of the reasons who he goes for the counter pick year for their progress it's it's really good in situations like that and it's even you even can win out on stuff that you don't like Warwick ultimate is supposedly Unstoppable and yet it loses things like trivial hook shots and stuff like that so honestly it was probably had like a public free related to your lure of your Champion or something Alright lyrics from the railyard a man who could ever stop the body sensor is a play the top side pillow 512 the same decided that flash of power. He was also know play well done there I I'll catch that what I like it's been laying a Colles main goal is usually to get to level six. You have your your big spike in until pressure and as you can see them out they had rushed for sort shoes so he also is looking for targets like Lilia and possibly even bottom line or Top Lane roams these are all viable kill targets for a collie really squishy Champion boy outfits too much everybody except his land upon its plays all of that he's looking to try to take advantage of fear but sort shoes definitely give you the extra Mobility. around around and you still have really good verse damage you know with your ultimate with your spell penetration Trace back and forth are the most of the Will Downing plays Oliver the wise though pretty close to see if there is fine work trezor not going to do anything to ask you guys against those two facings for who he is mostly the knock back and not that much of a cyst on butt be there a minor importance Day stuff for Sunday me the pretty good trade overall in Niles you have to cut away from this one Concord Police act up with Autos come back through Mazurek Reeves and he's going to feel reasonably okay stop Google Assistant back office closer to take the blue Power Ranger Through the Jungle the right plan for this Lane we had to earlier point where they don't want to sacrifice any of those early minions for the force attempt on to be Quinn and he's just rushed is steel caps with his store and shield has been able to see very very good numbers for PS4 Renekton Quinn matchup it can be way worse than that especially if if the jungler on the side of the Quin is nothing more aggressive than a Lilia it way way way way worse right now the way this in a little bit extra range meaning there so he's fine with the back porch them iconic will take that chance though to start up the Richfield police scouted to be no problems either 3000 help it is Quinn Shelton top comes down three B-24 now he carries want to go over to be their first duty is already on the way unless you win this fight fight this going to be a hero
how to static between flyquest and golden Guardians here a bit more later on as well and there is rhythm band was coming I'm sorry if I ever played against by Feist on Blue Sky self tell me that I kind of noticed in this final week that we're going to be playing on patch 10.3 before 1/2 Des Plaines to rock a nurse a lot of things just didn't put into practice time which I can't necessarily fault them for since you kind of knew that strategy was going to get nerfed anyway so I can fly push one was clearly it looks like they have them until it may be hard to deal with a big bruise that band for now because of the choices they made for thinking about to be there an author had a good soccer game I'm not sure that people way the wind is going to leave Pro play anyway so here is orange at the table as well andcan't argue with the power been specifically FBI's affiliate had been good but they were also kind of respecting Turtles a bell pepper and fresh picked at which has become somewhat of a normal thing as well as though might just being even more of that as time goes on it's not like a real to Sian set bonus but it just blinds of the theme song for the well yeah I really like it when coaches come in prepared with kind of a flow chart of what they're going to do things kind of go to planet Earth quick with their lockers because it does put pressure on the other team do not have as much time to think so we saw a cassette very quick loginboth sides and now the debater by Kodak Black on which support doing yeah forecast Misfortune with a lot of teams go with Liliana for a kind of more all in but at least this week we're seeing a higher priority on this Ratchford its ability to save people and I think it's a good pick for Keith support player who made mostly a role in Korean solo queue and probably keep scratching by a long shot so anytime you can get performance when a player is so above and beyond the bill like marginal value get from any other bands that I would just wrote down every single time is better than CNNDown the Line Band. Disrespect expected value from a ban vs like champions in a vacuum with power so can you breathe through their also like to point out ignore did not grow if he had a ton of LTS support that you should just be pulling out every game in the last weekend then do it for us that one fourth fourth 5 to become the front whenever him I get to play at least have it in and hops off closer I am a very big fan of so far the four Golden Gardens I get to go to pick one color to really rest I hope so I think it is actually in Uno plus not being ignored already playing the Ratonyeah show Super Fan they need magic damage and they have to have a line double Zoe and Ariana are too blind pics or on his something Pardeeville has been good in the past they were packing everything his Pretoria of the split but as you mentioned it is time for the answer in the mid lane and you're going away forces that was banned yeah that was one where Joey is something that a lot of teams are willing to Blind Creek anyway but has not necessarily something to go into it but Golden Goose couldn't do that for team composition reason they have all physical damage do except there's a way to pick you uplisten to go into tank makes no sense there for Speed / con and Rec but I can put out enough gold and items as well as it does look relatively standard in terms of not being surprised champions in the draft but I would stay fly Quest book to have a pretty darn Strong by B5 Oriana with a high potential for comboing as well as I recalled just having that strong to fight footprint and golden Guardians I think we'll have to be able to have like a pretty strong 20 minutes maybe get some dragons to play around and licking if you want to win this one also finds good Misfortune open to have a lot of that really great really really nice in the Boxsquat down but a bunch of the season-long for FBI in second With the Wind here all your schedule was easy tie for second this is the end of the first round robin you played every other team wants and are tied for second of golden got his win this one flat outside would be alone in second with no hopes that on catching them if they close out this for the win and that everyone want and I have the best record. 9 I mean looking around the world there is a lot of parody right now like aside from cloud nine who is at least three losses going on for losses ahead of every other team you look at the LEC was just wrapped up their week 5 they have16/4 in 1 game between 1st and 6th there is a lot of teams playing each other close early on in the LCS is no different here Wells Fargo in FBI actually dancing off mirroring for the removal of C the body yeah I meant not severe pain on Broadview but nothing like that in the brush is better than not we clean the brush that's true it means you're already moving and Direction like when it's killshot happen again next part of the lamps up on you almost never over matter is true but sometimes that like 1 and 500 thing that you do ends up being really big difference and it was that and that was game 5 world championship for something you know if you know like every once in a while he's a big boy. If you want to do like the fastest level 3 on Rex I will do wolves red rugs and then be able to get by in like a few seconds faster than maybe now it's going to be pretty easy Red Bluff kill blue is being skip as you mentioned and I don't think but I'm broke neck rugs & Beyond this point three of those Foggers of a lot of gold and specifically red side against Rex eyes really hard Mickey was talking about this when he cast some of the LEC match because of the size of that wall down there Rex I'd just come get you from so many different angle it's really difficult reward amount still looking to play around that box. Taking down the rest of the chickens on your got to say hey that's flash or Flash FBI really quick reactions are by FBI kind of knew that we got to be careful the closure is it actually in addition to cover yet but Santorum can't know that and kind of has to back away while FBI really wants to stick around to get sick and she has a flat for flashover although I don't get in here and they can what's a fight for the Scoville level 3 can't leave for closer wearing a blue buff it's not that important concert can't put in the Viper is top is pushed in and kind of interesting evaluating this early game of like where should send touring go cuz on one hand yes you have desire back on right side but like scat plus X Tower Dives or just really really good one of the reasons his priority is so high cuz he can push it and I'll trade almost everyone a really love or just threaten us all look alike a map of the route I thinking about a GameStop no flashes on 80 carry or support Miner Farm leave for FBI and Keith down here is that wave his manicured down and they know what that reason for using the closer is not close apps to make sure they're going to be safe I know the truth or wonderfly Quest a little bit aggressive there by Golden Guardian I can see that they were feeling confident because they had an Aftershock brush and tree versus to but they don't actually have that much damage with a doran's blade and a longsword so watching it one more time like what I wanted I was just making sure they can shove it in because if you guys going to go back to base and get damaged but instead he likes even on cool down from FBI when they go for this throw the path yeah they exhaust Turtle it is a really good double knockout with slows down the damage but I don't really see a situation where that's not at least a one-for-one trade which you just not worth the dive can understand the golden Guardians wanted to punish The Flash work on but definitely no worries there it felt like the second time I've seen today where the sport took the exam ignite I saw that there was afraid and I think the first through the day where there was all it against the recliner who like had all of his links available glycol exhaust used to get moved like it's like I don't need you to walk or Die For You exhausted I had was like son locked anyway then you know take Summerhill when you know little bit longer like I felt like you play you do with a knife and it happens when you think Jeff like summer choices are very ingrained in muscle memory and ignite fitness Portland for like a couple of years but on neck patches. Actually last a little longer so maybe teams are already starting switch back over now blows is in a lot of things right now cuz he's around and brings him to safety yeah but now they can threaten dive on bought flashless on both FBI and key but unable to push the wave in good job by FBI and keep down bought to actually make the wave not be at the challenge problem is though you can see the recall difference write the fact that one of those really close at all you just know we never take any trade you always play the back foot for Mountain Drake and now the question will become how quickly do they set up Rift like it gets easier for flyquest here if this bottom line can stay for stuff it means they can always be the first people to reset for 8 minutes when they run out this way so that's actually why you see closure already driving and getting some few things you didn't because it would be really hard to Golden Gardens to Max's retro Swap and it's like what does it right they could start running Wii with game closed right now is topside here and maybe he's helped out with life in the Old With You by Hans are they damaged but yeah really no actual gang to be had and less Piper gets a little but I didn't know you there I just kind of been on viper he hasn't looked great on things that aren't ribbon he's getting Frozen by Hunter here but he's also kind of okay with it cuz we ever do cigarettes help fight let me see funny farm right now in my prince EP without it is what it is like to waves that's going to call TT burn he can actually just run by and if there is a referral if not like you can see that already running a bot Lane the rest of the team running straight towards this Rift Herald so that is the place like Weston it's it's hard to match by Golden Gardens right there is leaving their bottom Lane so they're losing out on Farm down there and Hunter has recall these little bit afterwards on it and they they both are preserved as Greece but that BS or difference of course still there are you still don't want to take him with any fight that involves wildturtle when he was being that it is flashed out of this is but with all the way from almost any mini for crowd control I'm going to go by with Saint Peter's I still don't like to on suet still Lane pressure like in The Herald
as the team's floating the Champions flag freaking Jack take it away thank you very much. I am freaking to my rights to be literal IPL Champions 3rd or 1st 2004 at 5 and 3. I forced a mortal's every week I go into it and I look at their schedule my say good day in front of them games this week in the LCS where the teams are very close in the standings and I'm hoping for a little bit more clarity afterwards but what usually end up happening is datejustcloser and closer together so I just feel if you got to game separating 2nd from 9th beer in this league very exciting. Pelicans first pick in his fourth to take on this and anything else but I'll check has been really successful for most of this year it's one of the big reasons along with that committee for a lot of immortal suggest I'm also kind of happy to see you're born so highly prioritized I said last week on my podcast real XP that I think everything to take one like if it's available in the draft may be a champion like Soraka should be above it but the fact that you can play in table for mid lane it can wash most Lenny faces and then scale while later means you should just do it so I agree with that would change of really drylook at a bar a second take my coming through here as well it's not going to just yet it's been going through on the bottom Lane is beer a whole lot of pretty good as well they are not wanting to engage your Immortal yeah and after moving on scratch will give a little bit of extra Mobility for Affiliates but it's not nearly the type of protection Christine earlier in the air with like a brommer of Tom kench pairing so you'll possible for Mortals to attack that and some of its kind of weirdly happen in this week of LPS drafts isI'd say in the first 4 weeks you usually see a jongleur picked and paid one but we keep seeing both teams not taking it here maybe because of increased priority on orange do people are locking an extra solo laner early on yourself you can see a bunch of Jungle Band come in here and face to yeah it makes me feel like in general consider that may prevent the jungle looks like it's fine to feel something almost as good and you know who are going to the Orange is very shallow and Aidan cares if it's very shallow is the fourth very shallow and so you know I think it does make sense if they really kind of Power Band by dignitas I do wonder if the Szechuan East doesyeah this is us are not in on this path to playing on right now but we never got to see a whole lot more of her probably the band face in next weekend's games but says want he's in very very big Frontline right gigantic TV thanks. I afford MF can you play them into the back line and we're going to be if I can put out damage himself any possible you can talk to you to make sure they get a load of damage they can just take the Garvin they're trying to match with some really gangster Greg I'd say their compositions does have the ability as a juggernaut mean incredibly high damage Champion used to build Julie Andrews early is good against a group of tanks and then FL EOS 1 PS3 items can heavily shred tank so they don't really have an issue in the DPS department I think it needs a lot of flexibility here probably pick her I going to go to Oriana here just give me a story on a game in 9 so by far his most played pick he's currently to into on it and I really mixed feelings on his Oriana where I know he's really good at it and he almost always wins Lane but this is going to be like my personal opinion I don't necessarily like him on Oriana right now because so many of dicks games go wait and the late game reliability of Oriana is too low for me I would rather see her cuz you suck enough winner that he's going to be able to power up and that damage would be more reliable but we know they clearly have a preference for Orioles now V stick and its mass with a fork you so we're really looking to go late game and that just played it last week and the current traffic is very very strong events going late reliable damage and Magic damage to go skiing competition otherwise mordekaiser gets Invincible with a miter Armour Staffing still takes the right pic installation and then I could have performed well on the stand it's going to be fun to track that midlane as we move in like how much can frog and win that lane by and what can he make happen with that pressure because I have games where it hasn't worked for frog and Joe Rihanna has been up 20cs but doesn't take Midland power doesn't make the successful it's like the cookie cutter criticism of frog and sometimes happen when he's on I will see to go get his way out of Elena get things to happen for the squad dignitas in Immortals on one game of fart as they load me the rift VR game 3 of The Day of the ALCS and worlds tied for a year probably thought that fragen was Mick dip in this game or so anywhere else but Mark said it was all about the jungle difference that is not up for debate Willie curious TV again I called back but analysts said when I'm a little on the side of probably in the fact that I don't think Greg is as bad as a lot of people say and it's not to say the Greek is a super top-tier Elsa jumper but I want to see more of Greg taking control of the game rather than being like an errand boy who runs around from Lane to Lane that's where I feel like he's struggled in the past but when he actually does go aggressive I feel like he's been fairly successful he's up fast with fighting immortal thanks guys all got the job with me Immortal currently 5 and 3 coming into this game I wanted to pick your brain on the current sentiment around the excuse me Immortals wondering can't how long can you keep up the success I mean as long as we keep bugging you should be should be fine I don't think that anyone besides United showing in st. performance otherwise you know it's not like your mother's being horrible and I don't know TSA I want to see something amazing as well as we just kept how to catch up to the do you know the train so at the moment I mean we have a small lead it's not like well like five fathers fogon but we don't pay worse than any other team so I don't really mind all care about what they say about the team looking at school discrepancy between the mid and junglers what are your thoughts on that I don't know but I'll let you get back to deep backstage but good luck back to you guys how to get very much hope you have a very tight race here in the LCS will be closed up the first round robin nine games then we'll be the record for most the teams that have the Des Amis Stone Corky Ken Lovett I'll talk about on Eastern a little bit more throughout but I wanted to touch him to have a teen interview right there and you and I were talking about this for the cash as well as like what do we make of Immortals at 5 and 3 cuz I think a lot of people really want to say like oh the second best team let's start defending them as I can talk to you in the ALCS I would rather just talk about like celebrate the success of getting the five wins so far and know that everyone in the LCS is very close like one win separates Immortals from big and I think to win separated 2nd from 9th in the ALCS so far so great going for a successful in Bay sinks aphromoo I'll get back to this point is going to have service in Jungle can I saw two look great and it's a to Camp lead it's 3 minutes in but they have killed exactly one that's the type of aggressive bring that I like to see right Keys taking charge the jump his supporters following Greg into the jungle rather than calling really starving out Xfinity early in the game but overall at this game kind of progressives what's that what she said at the start of the year is hey I just got a bunch of really smart players and even though we didn't have them at practice before the season we're going to be able to win games that way and I think that's been how they found a lot of their success and if they are to continue winning it's about making sure they can get these men like with wind conditions in fact filter experience and smart players can find a way to be and so far it's been pretty good for them right at 5 and 3 and on the side for 4 and for looking very good right now I ended early game is finally I can to get to the recall off get some control Wards and try to get some Vision stuff done Greg they'll get to the top schedule now as well level 4 as a two-level lead and then look to me please stop the pain at crust top is pushing there and what is going to be on what are the opposing jungle dignitas will. Be stopped there is great. I think they like take to win your whole jungle has already had like a farmer camps but keep forgetting we're asking if you would be she got him with the squires Bloom he had the top wind pressure through hunie like dignitas really coming out of the gate firing so if watching where this last don't hit like it's really knows that he spotted but he says okay I have to Smite I should be able to just secure this but expected you don't have a flash like so I can't follow who he in do you just going to die there so really nice aggressive play anak Smithy kind of uncharacteristically doesn't respect the other driver having a branded old man I'm not sure if you're not going to walk into melee range what's the boards down get this like it's a boy self kill the middle of four for the damage is there it's still a win for immortals 221 in that fight a raptor where we go we know that some people talk about the bot Lane party the mid laner top way parking off the rafter party that's what we have going on in this one rig does pick up another kill and ask him if he does die again so that's gas will be even bigger but the fact that there were killed going over Mortals does help them catch up yeah I never saw him so I have to go to a board and Bourne interrupted recall in order to get this off and yeah it's just a little bit later and it happened who could have waited a little bit longer then it might have worked out for dick but Immortals definitely more group and on the same page for that play thumbs down this for himself he is down 7 PS it's getting better from her to respect out of that wire like in the first move get on the board a little bit there is Greg do still feeling so comfortable in the jungle he's still got pushing Lane spots in throat right now as going to be a pretty easy Mountain Drake. Very end of the game 1000 Godley just in the jungle matchup but the game is only $700 Parts when Mortals are winning in the other lane. Advocate back because if they kill he was able to pick up and Greg actually a thousand gold up on xmithie the big thing will not kind of need to track is like what's driving going to be in this game because looking at the team composition for dignitas this might be a tank driving game right you're going to have a bunch of damn coming out from your dragon off mordekaiser Johnson's going to scale up into Lake game but there's always that question when you have that early start on Jarvan Like a Warrior and try and hard carry cuz if you go cinderhulk this will lead well nice won't have a huge amount of character that's totally agree I would actually really not mind Warrior for Greg in and look at him so cute right now there's three tanks and of course he's going to be out of your way for most of your place it's an instant cash value Barron always going to die if you are. As the ultimate so much just for you would be fun I was going to make that Ralph Anderson hooked on and I think you weren't really surprised by that he's literally you know that can help maybe we'll see how that you do turns in but not too much damage that has week X-Men apocalypse through the Raikou breakpoints for SS used to always say about a committee as they were winning for consecutive championships on Team Liquid was like no matter what happens in the early game oh really good Lantern as full-time that's almost nothing back to the Smithy is no matter how bad the early game went could always make the next plan goes down and say yeah at 8 minutes I'm going to be level six and I'll be able to gain van and then what happened so like yesterday or the game went really poorly but like let's see how it's made by this way back in the game he's hard farming is jungle that's clearly communicated to a lot of these players you can see so
if life has been one of their bright points and I think they should match up well against does liberty mean they have them pretty solid but they are looking to rebound here today and put it into their of losing ways against hundred deep I'll give it up come through as they start to fix and the Vans and it's almost every Academy team has a record that very closely mirrors or else yet they are a a screw-top squad overall contract has been a lot of time in the LCS are you trying to work back towards that so we have more teams that are willing to come try crazy stuff that are willing to be flexible and really kind of Swing for the fences movie times with you, right I thought the fighting so we'll see if I come through I do think I was going to support his is viable will be fun to play Maurice Moore think it's actually one of his strong points has come through from time to time there is the ability to punish those with John for the cops play more heavily for a plane and we just are coming off that easy game or without you being a booton dominating a claim against Israel and Brahms will be that first text that though and we do know it's he is flexible there is a possibility of it going you do multiple Lane deer could be jungle could be top but it is actually the first set play for fly Quest Academy this is what I get for them and that you really do I just bought land come through cuz you have a guaranteed heavy front line behind it very very good blue or red stripe draft grab all three Champions and you almost died on that a long time so he would give you some really strong engage this is Dad going to be the Nautilus we are built really really good engaged to one but still feel great gang set up do much lockdown in between their the passive roof know how old are knockoffs as well as your old clothes and stuff if you don't have a truck on you I am the vine you stuck there with no weights beef but yeah going to play one of the very few tech support said because he has played 10 sexy be more in the range component and so this one cuz I have like this we do I like just gonna say it is actually the first Nautilus pick so far this split so bringing out another your dad to his repertoire and lacity how he does do you want it but you will be able to be free for active on the champion and looking to settle allspice and they got to be able to follow up on that rather sell used to deal with all of that look pretty good in team fights without damage as deities and look pretty good as well when I dropped off or going to see what that kind of thinking of the consequence that is going to be expecting again top things that feel as we know it can move around to see if not if I put that I'm selfish expected Texaco through and now we got to wait to see what the visit is going to be and we can speak like Lipstick Jungle mid most likely everything you know is the closest Staples Tech not really heavily punished by many things that people are willing to play in the net of these days when people talk about I think it's really really strong we have this thing in some regions yeah it's coming out and especially with that want to go late and said one is not the champion to punch right this is not like you're going up against the lease in Oro off is going to be in your face and can be updating you telling you off in the early stages be able to scale be able to look for level six and try to get aggressive there okay later on is going to be potentially Affleck then we could see the Lucian talk to sure it did it is surprising to see like a blind Lucian mid that is why I'm thinking that it was 5% that tardos till mid set jungle play almost any combination of both lanes by pollution made with that top in front of the Jungle EP it comes in at Lucian most likely go set mid know if you want to start of a Fuse Top Lane know which is gluten in the atrox that you have to really early generally to have the same kind of exit their phones are going to ask it is looking like it will be in triple-fan but I do not have a tremendous amount of walk down after you take us to ligo and if the Casio is able to scale up and come to go even in this Lane that is going to look very very good for Toledo alright exciting stuff right here are you going to come and spend some more time look at his wife with composition because I think about engaged for this. It would be more reliable locksmith right there but they have a front line and they have a very aggressive back to the damage is there that BC is there was a damaged profile is there what if you're lacking magic but not be one that locks the damage profile this would look very very good I like the dropper fly but I think there's a lot of work really well here yeah I agree I think a lot of Frontline very heavy and gave us that money as well as a novice Casio NFL use your miktam is profile there for the scary looking to be able to follow up and have a few that fourth yeah I think if you know a lot of my eyes are really going to be on Lucian and carpet I do think you so much I've had this game is going to go is going to be depending on how they are playing if person gets way too behind in the earliest age you lose that magic damage and likewise if if Lucien is able to punish the Casio I do think can be tough have the same kind of effect is that Cassiopeia later on in the game where he has most effective against a lot of these Champions absolutely well we are the rest and we'll see who can take this win flyquest currently one game behind him to be only slightly different choice conquer on a philipssite end it because he talked more often said he should send to her ass to get the 3 Sniper out of pretty evenly but I'm not sure on the Fly Quest bot Lane set of used for the summoner's there is no night this is barrier healed Guardian right so that is about as defensive if you can get if you are looking to keep your marksmen player alive your mass in this case know if he is going to be getting engaged upon will have a tremendous amount coming through from that room as well as the double prevent stomach flu mean JJ's of course Very squishy if he does go in and I can always be a threat and Caspian grounds you at almost any range and we'll see how that plays out but otherwise nothing to Stellar happened to the game even among Champions like people like that you're a tank Garden seems okay again spoke but you don't lost a match answers even on loss of Mages it is actually very very effective knows the highest win rate on things like bar. Morgana even on Champions like Nana and Nani is often very high because it's so easy to actually have it apply to do anything with it for it to be effective and it really does help to deny a lot of potential all in family on you but on your Lane Apartment price yet so far we are from the very start here I can't leave the engage nice roof there and freeze gets damaged across did you first walk backwards the wave is pushed it looks like a little XP was west side and they hire a wave here and get level two dropping a few more csunity has missed about 3 Fri Mistress of the way she sees guys are going to trade back and forth between Emily and Potions are pretty nice it is going to be phased by sheer force him to do so about Cassio in Lane that can be very important you're playing at The Crest Lane really is mad at me because you have the ability to read incredibly powerful eat when you are standing up that's when things really really strong but you in the early level it's also very easy if you're a bit over aggressive with it and kind of sustained by someone like a Lucian is cuz you never really outperformed you if you do run out all right now it's the power clear to get the actually a to Camp lead right now for the cards which is really at expectation to be on drugs by 3 minutes and you're not going down another engaged on the bottom side just I'm just back in town and not easy being done right now for Sasha to eat already fully cleared anchor gets them away still supposed to land fanatic very comfortable here and that should mean that they will be able to grab that top side Scuttle and again I mean this is kind of the power of Carthage New Jersey 3rd broccoli by D I forgot to find the route they could go to the flashcube but even need those flashes us know what is your flash that late first plug comes through for contract through with the past Andrew from Nautilus ajwani coming through Mashpee The Flash toy earlier than that failed to do so and then once he was already essentially guaranteed to die while he waits both talked about how they're setting up to have every advantage to try to survive with barrier he'll Guardian everything they use it all and they still life Honda Frisco zip up the topside potatoes across the farm is a crop Farm fanatic get that go from ended up get that XP take over this game and it's bedtime you know even shopped yet but have you done the man is back to group now has the camps to return to write he did outside. All them look for a gang and then Retreat back towards the jungle. A lot of protein looks like to talk about is pressure and then Farm you know new go look for that many countries back mashka took here has decided will that very clearly earlier really does not get them again cuz you know he used to come through and then it expired beer getting flashes out does go down so pretty poorly time Summers on both accounts honestly from Mash that is the same with barrier you know he'll you just press it and it does something for you beer has to be timed with the incoming damage to get the most out of it through this could be good breed to get a Ghazt the anchor wait to see it then. Have a good life. Games I could have been scary equal far right now in the middle and basically is not stop anybody back and forth Revenge season 4 Shots across Nolte's opiates are ya this can be a tough matchup for a chocks especially for Leon set really does love to ball with these types of Champions it's kind of more days Rock the chunks where you down and talk you down as you get more CVR no reliable moved all cast but if it comes straight to Autos usados in that regard next Avengers when his lame-ass shop is doing a good job brawling up at a farm there but elsewhere it's obviously quite nice the first Blood kill the bottom line through the use by good yeah that's a big one good thing also happening first legal here in the mid lane really not very far behind as far as the Cs Department goes to see it already bass triple has not got the full to your by which is a really big amount of gold to be able to hit there for Casio does relief so many of your man problems then officially looking good too much done and because you have spots on their plan do the oldest TV that it should be able to be set when he got you have a lot less if you are getting pretty good at that one if you want it's not quite that so far deal with a second recall grab Cordova components plus he has not been out for my contract score right now some of that response time has been left to languish and pink and white work for the carpet and tile contractor to clean the board look up his Mountain Drake so far so good. Lisa pushed it back the $100 I mean you have the Nautilus you have his money was going to be some cuz it says built up between those two campaigns for sure and then I'll be asleep some smaller amount going to be gave me to buy atrox and some of the other Champions butt down here in the arms race both guys dancing very heavily on the early game trying to have that power and it also makes you so much more difficult to Ashley all in on when you do have all of his phone as hell from the Thorns Idaho where is the turret damage stuck on the cross the two plates taken down first one Breezy very well down here
Empress it really is the most people had power ranking near the bottom I wasn't Mortals in almost every Power Ranking that I saw and they've really happened proving people wrong and it's been more about Just Energy between them. How wealthy were together about finding ways to win in what are not always clean games what are some time to really Scrappy games that they have to kind of maneuver their way out of no I think a lot about that seals you win of gets ocean sole having the back door to get that Victory and had a lot of clothes and then it's not because we have in the past seen some things that are considered really strict going to Cuba anti fixie on things like a mordekaiserare in the past I came out as an answer to the you mean obviously we just saw an incredibly successful game on you means laugh and I wonder if that is something that you were going to do because if Yeezys were thinking that if they're fixing that this could be a block of puppies that are screaming and saying hey actually I'm really really try to find something is rectiv playing with Harding who kind of powder and I think something is this a sticky place that you can get yourself out of out of the heart engage this feels like a steel to me then you really really want to play as girl for all sex because as you say it's a very safe to hole in the ceiling do you want to stop for the same time to really how you view me is did with the all-in tick and egg rollsusually what you think of for that can be good to follow up at times but it's very rare lion I having the correct angles on stopping in between you and your opponent things can really make a big difference again those number 3 and please send break the chain has been scaring Play U2 camping every single game pretty good things I'll get over it when I started winning bottling for EEG but say no or an is a like top boy 5SOS but you can definitely do like an official Rushmore made against LeBlanc it's just have too much HP to really be easily breaks down that is something they could really look forwhat is most consistent X really frosted for ear feels like Everton two-bits come out he has been so good on it it is a strong match up individually against at least in that sense Darren real people talk a lot about the unfurrow interrupting me to damage there so we'll see how we can deal with laid out so far more doses of the disc golf text or more to deal with that doesn't work either conquer Lee Andrews Rushmore to Kaiser really can't match up well against that a worn a lot of percentage be damaged a lot of the same kind of deal with you on there so looking at it so that you can see inside counters there and I will see what I was giving flu is the top three picks at Kumo has had our bit so he is only place where he has a shock Williams that one game or something new there were criticisms about achieving pool last year when he did come ingas is very Reliant Apartments Jake's pick so we'll see how much he's kind of grown from that can you bring something out here that is going to look good if it is going to match up well potentially use this morn excited to see that grows from, because I do think he's the one who has been a pleasant surprise For Me Above All my expectations were and he's a player that I think has a lot of room to grow as a young. Thank you led to spell to punish you be Lanes entirely I know the Leona Banh made sense cuz hey that's the best part in Gatesville right thereAlistair which what you got to use your Roar to interrupt and rejoining with a d makepeace he actually delays you mean from being able to rejoin the females there to do something like a me support and Billy boy is a lame mean this is this is the pic that last game we saw you used to like to see into the wrong now you're picking the wrong and they already have a new me so you really are kind of working into their favor it is going to be the Renekton or Kumho up there in the Top Lane do a lot of early and Nikki and power it feels like for a Jeep know I'm looking at this squad already I feel like like they pretty much have to win early on to have a reasonable chance in the future I was born is going to give you so much Frontline so much scaling later on if that's you when there's not a relief of Frontline magic damagetax in the back line orange can stack up the armor in HP deal with those May numbers there for Keys give you a lot of stealing a grill there too and you have this really busy Frontline so you're going to have to make the most of the early game Power LeBlanc least in leasing Renekton all pair up very very well at least you could be an early dominant later so we'll see what age you can get done if they can start stacking objectives free to be gold leaf for this could be pretty easy elevation towards here Corky is 90/10 Magic physical or an indirect silver Rollins but it's still not going to be putting their first game of the week+ 2 did you make that one happened to rip the fourth and Final Table La so big they can be had supposed to squeak tied with p.m. or into time is now 4 and 4 they are already 5 and 1 I do believe so are fun to write 5 and 2 right now the game as the green foot to the sides in battle with Immortal as you know I do know it was going to be summer I don't care a little bit here and yeah I mean alright well we're going to stop what we're doing right now we've got Gabby on the side of Artemis well since I have you by my side Artemis I did just want to ask you a kind of really figure out what's going on with you you write two games in a row Ciroc a band you me and how much of this has to do with the prioritization of heavy healing in the middle right now feeling is strong and sustained and general especially with you being so rocket but with the bus we saw that you me recently and I think it's a really strong pick and we've seen LSD prioritize it pretty highly this weekend and maybe a bit slow to catch on like this osteology Pickett yesterday and one game today to pick as well as strength we think it's great and laying its gills very well and I think I can take over the game with pairing like LeBlanc and a Truck seems like this so we're pretty confident that we bought a practice on it and I'm excited to see how it how it goes quick question for you before I get to go and watch it obviously Warren Perrin was a big heavy portion during the last game you just named a couple but is there anyone in particular we should be marking out for as priority for you me okay with you me this game is going to have some fun I like that having to pay first boss will talk about this first then we'll talk. You need it more but they're Mortals have toward Vantage Advantage find Avenue me is there but if that you hit Bank. Probably plopped down smoke lens do in Basel can push him around just going to run and patience very soon I got to be careful this one is the alternate how to become a marksman steering committee is running in the health field and have a great time in a really rough but the kills going to come through it just okay is donated $700 The Mortals that was a terrible in babysitter for so long and then the balance split away from Xfinity leaving him alone with basil and back it was why are they trying to do fully committed chasing Spence Karen Wright Innova skill-shot the Mist now you need to just go back to help your jungle actually finish this but instead and Hawk will be completely charging after Karen Huger not even able to get in range of the hit if he is ignited surely going to die and he spends a flash so fat goes to worse there but that was just a terribly organized invade from Immortals and they're going to be kicking themselves really far behind off of that I mean their level one they treated support classroom in flat did you take should have been down a Summoner and having a rough time is too early kill well is going to start taking over this game you have to assume but both on a gold necklace is what in Mortal going to work through them and he's only down kind of half of a campaign that evaluates get paid less than legal 12 but the kills the kills are really really big I mean we talked about how he zhi kind of needed to Snowbowl early game as now with clots coming through here but just in case his face so that you can probably go out of his way out but you know I'm right at level 100 LeBlanc that's going to be feeling incredible I already a very big early by here I can want to play this land offensively to scale-up that becomes much more difficult when your opponent has all this early gold injected into him realtor didn't really get a chance that can touch on it is Omni Stone Corp was really surprised by the power in this is constantly applying a having a low cool down and being able to constantly lies them in Reigns versus rain matchups I feel that is much more difficult if you have a match up that you were bullying as a range Champion maybe you're getting a lot of product out of it I'm going to be kind of Institute actually talking it but right now, because he was so ask then go back and forth so cute so use comet in like a charity fight who would tell you how to conquer and press the attack Middletown pool and Healing Place on him as well as well with on this phone so I see how it works also where you will for sure get as long as you're able to write over something like they put work into that is giving you your guaranteed guaranteed Keystone coming out into the steam pipes but this is the only does and the other thing is interesting about this is that actually prioritize W Predator when you coming out of base now be a gangster from Spencer graduation this one knows you have plastic some good for the damaged but don't you come down and get some shots there in Spanish pushed off at 1/2 HP till I honestly think that's a great game from Spencer and you know he can go back to me soon I could just keep be back out and lost about half of his self he has no function so and that is going to get really difficult against my opponent so let's reset this let me get a free base and try to get back out on the map not terrible also of note is because he's a market into a dumpster to buy that really she helped him get some of the extra power early on but I really do like you as well I think it's actually a hugely beneficial ruin to just get you on the power spikes when you can't always do it that's why I like that pick up a lot in the Articles of graphic that if I could bring pictures that's it's interesting and I'm just I think of something that is largely unexplored especially the Predator interaction I really do think can have a lot of value you know when you're thinking about your core he wanting to get package and we can work out of it as somewhat similar way or just give you look up your package was on the map with that bullet speed from the package at the front of the route to discover a shout or nice curly pressure there is a force mid was pushed a force that recall off the hike up here as well and so the reference tables with great so far in that bottom Lane you can see that it was actually All Tech Force onto the sheen buy new trying to have a little bit more power to try to combat this is not going straight into the tear the fact that up as fast as possible we can have to go back to that later on so this will slow down his stealing a little bit but he just feels like hey you're getting fresh with this I believe already lost a fight you need to have some, power now a while but slow but goodies Burbank to Duke backwards it's really no way to threaten to kill on Lucian when your support is Rob like right there and I can't get a whole lot done there is one of the rooms at hard to get rid of because you need to have fully stacked before it actually goes away and Conquer to actually make it to cycle out that is a bit eventually I'm going to curious on your thoughts about lethal tempo as you look good to me it does help with Frontline killing and I've been seeing this pick up a little bit more there's not really a great room for Ezreal he had been gone conqueror by missing one more lethal Tempo kind of word additional attack speed which you need a lot of when you're trying to kill Frontline but there's not a ton of that in this game station in haste based on
with those teams that are to be at the top like this I'm going to see if we can make it happen in Valentine's Day card made from plant indoor growing sunflowers so you know the mother nature things still happen for me I will never be able to afford a house while he just ignored by the White House polarized Sorakayeah that mean Viper obviously known for his ribbon is has some incredible for me on its rocket much more love than alabanzas days people just do not like you play against it snowing shampoos that fills a similar role but I do feel that it is a Wonder playing that and it doesn't have the same sort of cross map in fact some of the reasons that maybe we haven't seen come out just yetwe have the first Misfortune definitely in this patch and if that's true for quite a while or has steadily risen in popularity I think it's actually a real early pick overall. As well as it has been in the most amount of later it is because one of the drinks of the champion but also I would not expect power of evil at the player to take us you almost always is playing the late game scaling damaged carry type Champions down straight away from that very often in his career doesn't mean I cannot go to him we talked to Yorkton play it but how he would be expecting just play more of that kind of control beach towel because that feels like his bread and butter and that is where he has had success for your game and Hills get 800 ECM you know that'll probably end up being a woodengetting away from them to do a whole lot here I'm sure that they get a more aggressive jungler credible gauge in a really good setup talk about the Broncos and passive there but it's Valley Oaks with the roof could do a graviton for the alternate route to mop lock him down for some big hit it hard hitting and take you out so I didn't want to see some of that targeted I would not be surprised to see Greg at Target it out I was going to say if I would like to pick up pick up the Olaf and that is kind of jungle fuss UV combo that we have been seeing until we get some of the stuff along lineshas not really been shown the info Play exciting absolutely no but I'm sure there is a Civic Champion that pee wee has in mind I think he is as well that they drop off that was in my head and I was like let's get first dibs on Jungle or mid and syndra can come through on this so we can be a little bit dangerous if we are going to love walk and it's also just a champion that fights jungle that is very good for any type of lease in a really powerful jungle canteen to come in and really focus there are we do now let's get some sleep outside but it's not as though they can't be focusing their efforts around mid life crisisso we will get to find out what is mid or jungle play in the mid lane if this is Bell cause that I am expecting you to be jungle Pantheon which does have your not not the kind of same speed of clearing like an old law for Leah for Pantheon either way that's incredibly good to be 2 combo de panteon with a pointy fix done except for that size mixture of This Blink and that was actually is a kill laid a griffin totally play with in life with it if it is something that can work really really well who is going to play which party has both those can Jungle Book this leaks in the forest and pour it inis there is no spots coming through will be at the Thalia for Buicks in alongside Starbucks Pantheon but either way send me Global Mobility here coming out from the jungle to be to a CSM I expect him to play for priority deadline and then take that and go elsewhere look towards the sidelines utilizing Pantheon all at the same time as the Tule all just cutting them off and that is going to be a really exciting Duo to Tri Pantheon jungle to start back for a couple of times trying to help kiwi would do is ruins wrong and lose benefocus but it is in the middle and physical damage jungle and top very exciting what are the draft conclude Pearson towards leaves them inspecting big things out of him but I think even bigger things out of Dar toques Pantheon with two good length again forI really do think so much of the game will come down to the play around midnight because it's Thalia does not have a push against interest I cannot go elsewhere on the map and his dad is where I just going to be both jungle it hovering around that is laying looking to establish vision control trying to help get priority for them than later so then take that bit later and utilize AccuWeather dive toppling. I bought land looks with acts of these vulnerable Debian like perhaps EMF5007 block west of going to do battle he's not a chance at tying second place in terms of winds up to 5 is where they sit right now in a mortal and we'll see if they can make that one happened the game has begun and we will see how much start off in the jungle on TSN can do with the pantheon pick up Ian has if I stay for a dart aqueous do you can't down when you see that the more and more of the Champions is not just feel deep Toledo WAP with you kind of feel like you know is going jungle is is giving them a bit of a different look in draft which is always going to give you an edgehere Wego always need to start to square off and looks like no no aggressive invade so far we do rarely see them so they worth pointing out double cleanse on the side of flyquest really respecting the combo there from Dyrdek as well as Bjergsen you know if you do actually eat that full combo it is definitely going to be a hundred as you're you're going to get really low the xq damaged coming through from the pantheon was he is probably enough to kill you off so how are we going playing Phase Rush does lead me to believe he's probably going for the Super Soaker that builds is becoming really really popular on Sandra especially alongside the phase rush you have the ability that is pretty unique to the champagne to actually passed while moving slowing down your phone and speeding up with the phase Russian can be put offdon't feel like going to walk away now Spotify this week because I don't believe they knew exactly to get going offensively or they put down to say hey if he's inventing a blue indeed they are that should be in that with the info Centrelink ago his right cheek when it blew yeah so we should be able to answer that and what this is TSM doing is just kind of splitting the back right now they're looking play down towards that bottom side well we did talk to me intro different leave anything that really wants play heavily towards outside this is signifying is my tickets what happened are going to keep running Jefferson Chevelle some space and it's only some poke but it's not a health are leads to the flag was Jungle and it's only can't for a camp Augusta actually love this from santorin the problem with it is that he probably is going to get three bus but I do think that this is such an interesting look almost always in professional play when someone makes them move to actually split mat if this ends rated and that's a handshake if he will takedifferent felt like he could actually go and challenge our dogs to catch him out and while they don't actually get the kill he did pull him out of the Jungle he did get the advantage so we'll see where he can take it from here but yeah it is going to be dark very likely getting at 3 bus start and it means other pantheons not going to take any time until he recalls to help me not going to be there on that champion it looks like Midland will finally pushed out to you we fight and 17 of a possible night alright they want to split the app and play to work spots I this is also denying some of that right because if we're actually making control of his multiple pants on that bought side he can still play around and try to disrupt the game plan that is coming through from garlic Jarred garlic is actually going to face after taking his truck so both of us are available he could look to do something like red to blue and then look up for MIT I'm looking for this one now is it supposed to be walking back away from Pua from Tarlac has taken the recalled heading towards the top 7 how to get his own blue as you mentioned through something was likely and is loosen up and stops in Turin all right, nothing special know OK bit of a surprise he's not going straight to his red but I think if you're bored and you know that went down to his boss Thai jungle you were expecting that that has gone right you are thinking then my Dockside okay the more vulnerable buff debuff is more likely to be attacked is it closed so he's just actually going essentially blue to blue and then fall back towards that read if you want to end your bath and actually look who attacked or that bottom side then having a longer duration on that Red Bluff take Ian Moore close to where you're looking to get a junk food makes sense though games and and back and forth between these two jungler DeLeon end result is it feels like it's a head for dry dock right now actually as I look over on his for everything else but the first recall actual money-wise he stopped by a couple hundred, crab and just kind of been in here so I can kill and then taking them more valuable Cactus patch obviously on his opponents buff right so they do have that 41 campus Bailey Bowlen Bluegrass play here they could be late but now I have to run again to the shieldlands acute how far is just so high and see if you're going to force turtleback remember turtle is not playing Hellboy he is playing Glenn so he's going to have to face the front as well as a flat comes out Turtles get that shield now is all the talk. I could flash that he has enough to kill every single time do they react in content or knows what's going to find a shield that you mean to stay alive at the very least still laying those beta Steven board now we can likely take away that brought here from his opponent once again I probably will be jumped on it be here by Viper but a really good wrong from Pearson he gets a flash of santor any delays the face extremely long from this White Spot Lane so they will lose at least one plate two likely lose most of it's not an entire way and you know they already put white behind off this yeah I think they already lost a full wave and the second one is crashing so just look at the Cs difference down there in that bottom Lane yeah I already opening up quite a big leak is nicely done to buy diapers again in about a broken plate but just try to help us back and forth pretty equal 1 overall news about a waiver for a man in the back of your drum over again worth it don't blame her the slightest It's just sad that it is fast and see why don't you look like while he got his boss has a dentist but sometimes most of the circumstances but the bot Lane off to a good start they're going to have a very preferential by here, able to give BF on his first by compared to the double long Surplus Foods in a turtle obviously not able to sail around long enough to collect that much gold is up and experience as we are seeing here you know he's about five and a half look at them for it. Even poured half over a full level down on Friday 6 with garlic at 6 to have that double semi Global ultimate that you can look to really try to get aggressive with your look at this without Hills at 800 Gould Lisa TSM early jungling has gotten them about a complete almost like I can make you feel more like 3 but the roads looking pretty good as well go ahead and so really good start for them the question is sort of in the Middle lake in Choctaw boys and girls games out but she wasn't even working DSM size what happened once again having to depart this bottom Lane to see if I'm on the way over yet again just going to run back if you don't back off there then you're probably just going to get dovin died right and if you do you're actually just eating the blue. So either way for TSM it is a smart move at the bit of a win-win for them over onto beer extended stay around will be going back to base now it is a lot of Bullseye Pockets but New York City would have to deal with a blue box and they will have their own rule of timer in there for defense to go through it more of a dive thought I'd take a black man to get away so it's like I'm knows they are safe but it's the 14 million difference down there it's BS or longsword it it's really rough and that's the bottom as well for getting some good traits are most active and I think that they're early moves or Superior and they are looking pretty good it's still not a monument to leave right it is going to be. I can Pierce in really looking to cash in and get them kills you and things to do in these earlier stages of the
before so we'll see if they can keep that one up and now we are in a Champions like to see if that can continue on or if they move up to five yes oh dig just one at 4 and 3 to move into 11 or 11 and 3 need a frosty or not the best not the best action most wins as you know de lis brackets updated so far against the north who has been very aggressive totally right about that lot of jungle bands coming out from the sides PSM speaker has had some cereal moment so far in Academy games there is one really epic moment early on in the season if you haven't even highlight where he jumps into the Elder Dragon pit bulls against Yale Academy kickz mikeyeung out of the pit as we cinnamon secures the Elder as his team just like Elder nuke everyone down stay out of steel just one of the most epic League of Legends moments I've seen from a perspective jungler overall is because third pick of the year on it yes call it really game jungle to make action happen oh no in Ori I can't get to play Jarvan so on paper not terribly contested as a champion you know they could if you want to win you should play Soraka really heavily Nerf than 10.4 which is a good thing in moments like tuaca liqueur what do I expect a protein to do like do you put games in on Soraka to get the two weeks of Victory or do you just try and like for ject what the nerves are going to be eventually and that end up scaring people away from the pickets is one of the reasons that like some more play in the lck this week even though they're on patch 10.2 because they're already practicing it for 10 Tree in these games are like no longer wave his self I Can See For The Academy guys at least unless you're specifically trying to prove like his look how quickly I can learn strong stuff would just say actually I don't expect this to be a long day something so I'm not going to stay strong even still look like a ridiculous Place Rocky forever in trouble who dropped you know below viability yeah until people you know they're fat 120 in Misfortune to pick up I think that's a really excited when I definitely a lot of kills right here King and diamond diamond in the car with the last year and a half or so and I had a very good year do you want to see him coming to the 440 is having a player remote valleys vet right you're not next to your teammates the things I've been through the fire but not having a good you were coming off his best game though against Evil Geniuses this week he had an affiliate game where he went 5-1 11 Stow Kent Flea on an upward trajectory he's got a decent Lane like diamond scratch has been really good in the past has been absolutely do not want it so far this but that's not always there at the vans come through or seeing next pretty Carrie band down there the Camille dropped off as well and will be I want to grab Top Lane or mid lane first and then yeah that is likely what we would see happening when I'm trying to think like there's a reason Tinder is high priority and often to end of Tuesday would pull out of camp that Joey is available is something she won with really is a tweet so far he's seventy-eight championship games I want to see I want to see me and just keep stuff going so that I can go though with the Camille's and they they go for the 8 show when you ban Camila. The effect of match of counters though they really want the atrox I don't think they cancel XSport fit but they thought I was going to grab a joke so they are they wanted to get him off of champion 3/4 stupid Orkin already gone so it's like Gangplank as last one left a lot of stuff being denied so far in the draft likely toppling pikir not the easiest person to be into dope GP app you let out the choices she's going to really pull into a back pocket do stuff like you're not allowed hey man I think I'm bored I'm bored too but it's not it's the Gangplank and now Cloud 9 get the double check in maybe it is sick afterwards so you mentioned it yet so the streak ends for Palafox Champions at 8 game I thinking about overall like both teams have a good spread of damage both teams have a different damage profile between the jungler and the mid laner which is actually pretty important when you're thinking about how the Elaine Chui Chui will work definitely a bit of a push advantage on the top side for the atrox early but there's a quick dented for the various Nautilus on the bus side CSM so I could match up right I don't necessarily won or lost Raptor has these fatal flaws to kind of followed the basics because he's very reliable in Gatesville unreliable as your best bet and not diamond is very good don't get me wrong but that is a very narrow window pain where is Flash is going to connect until I think he's been a little bit more reliable internships as well I'll see if I evolve can make that one happened here as well do you think the better record so far in the academy. Have began Academy traditionally has been dominant in the academy seen in part of seeing eyes off these and they did end up making a lot of moves with depleted their depth between the LCS TEAM Academy Rochester is known for being able to develop top talent from last night and picked up one of The Replacements and it looks pretty good for him so far and we'll see how well they can build their next year's at stars we got ourselves a man Cloud Nine's Academy squats I don't hear we were at the same as well no offense or something yeah yeah yeah yeah glad to have ya got it took me like way to find a Kenny at 1 that one was way for those two and then it was just a little slow today which one is it that they have it so that's a very smart person 115 statements he will deliver like you serious but he doesn't mean it and I never know if I didn't act like research are you destroy everybody and and you're often wrong when is often wrong when trying to reach at the inside check is like too difficult my most memorable story of this is educated guess and this is definitely a bragging I'm going to say is I know what you're doing yeah people ask what the origin of 7-Eleven was the one and I was just like oh it's because the stories to be open from 7 to 11 and now it's 24 hours and like it has never changed the name that's true. You must be true it's just like the lck school of plastic just believe that you say you're the best and Reddit is going to go with you cuz they're silver this one do you have any pre-game so we can let us being played in timing is a graph of the bottom line for TSM stuck at level one down here here comes to walk up flight or the Whoop That Trick that was really interesting normally Nautilus hook-like overpowers NEC see if there's an extra pulled out from the thresh hook that I really can't stay u c o i a Persona I burn all the time could you catch the brake pressure special getting hit by the Cure. You know a bit of distance build-out did you die or flies and thoughtful to come again they denied that's so free like you can't miss this good job 60 Gold urn I mean I'll take that every time yeah we heard more we was so cool that for me can't go for it I feel like there is Nautilus should be a powerful Lane so I don't know exactly what happened in before really face and made them get pushed off on the early levels in like the GP with his coaching Master start I can see that pushing inside a little bit but now I think that's how often should be going back just remember chance like I was like oh yeah it's fashion Jakob to happen right now so if there's any kind of figure out what I have ended up I think in order to get me fat bottom side but it did any time you're late for the lane and if it is always there's and just like his place out there both teams are playing appropriately you give us a second place so you got to be like absurdly started if you want you to not make that happen as though that's just the price I ask you one more time. I will kill him in speaker. Solve for first what was waiting for the job in eq2 Flash and lost just killed him while he was waiting Contender flashes not even eating to be you still there is the fairest of the game power coming through as well stay out of jungle it yeah so I mean they know that they have Speed Carbon on the way and it is basically a bait right after shock is down for Diamond so lost and just kind of move towards me as much as possible as you mentioned the flash food truck down like diamond but if you burn flash for that damage if you could then would have to save to be able to get the CC and kill him just a good run down gang lots of pretty safe early recall gets The Vamps after and we can move on as we wait to see what the next big play Heroes most one really softly and pushed Okla it have counterpick on the match if it looks really really want his hand and now we have diamond looking to Rome in the Middle Lane but free what when's the new Hunters way too much of Cloud 9 and Teresa's running the big Polly had a truck on to get away yeah good arena in their buy C9 evolved thought the cleanse was going to be enough to get them away but ended up just being way too much damage as well so it really good romantic made that also talk over the cloud nine now and very successful love Simon to room over there what is against oh yes they got a minute yasso not answering the questions here are the lanes that I expected to be winning ended up getting pushed in but then still generated kills yeah right because they end up the gate comes and then it happens but you're right man Jeff understand airpush detector one of the only times where I hate the other team is pushed why isn't the jungle here cuz I can fly but you are pushed in the other team isn't like this actually dangerous but not when two people to stop one more time. Of you yeah you have to but behind you and then flash later since it was already down but he's dead yeah yeah yeah in 4k going to be a lot of wind power can be locked out of the hall in that champion
I've been waiting for the entire go to see stats that back up and he had absolutely incredible rooms in the early game he got a lot of that early game going so it starts is on that level the recipes absolutely would be I like to hear Lucian band coming out pretty heavy targeting of hoody spam pool so far I wonder if we'll see the Ciroc a band I think it's worth taking if it's open yeah but I'll tell you this is also another one of those still a lot of Target and early which was a lot of big Power pick who are happy to entertain sprocket and stone O-Cedar willingness to lend support top Wing style he can fix it either one jungle experience was blocked on Tascam .32 I am using book for really fast farming jungers that can actually take advantage of this and reach the highest level of power even on patch 10.2 there was a game over in the lck with Pond Wildlife Experience phase power farm and Olaf and have a suraka UE power Olaf I teach you to run the game that's kind of what I'm wanting a team to do when I'm kind of excited to the first day of my calf this week has a chance to see those coming through Houston give me some so far this week set go through for some they has been Nerf is more or less mortal as a champion now still quite strong still worth playing and so play insta Bae says I want to the matchup I will carry them they said one games with obviously some of the things that I've been seeing out set in the program that make him a little bit more viable because a lot of people say oh just kind of broke like it's not going to be a big deal is people's adaptation to Alton carries out of fights do when someone tries to Die music for not trying to fit that amazing you know alt one guy in with full team type of thing would simply just peel is effective and also the W flash where you can get the tree damn sweet spot if you would spend your flash because you can use your flash passes a channel we're going to do is get your procedure off the game but it's one of the reasons I think that can remain viable is an accident. Someday here who has to look hairy for them earlier on the last week serious player to the end of the year where is Bedford MD complete garbage and Johnson what are the price point to your work and I really have combined for a lot of power over all Fortune definitely strong champion in the past but but still worth playing totally and we'll see if you know what the fact that I was just kind of trying to do a mental stock of which supports it ended up being banned with the Braun being taken out and knowing that they're up against Nautilus afelio still tons of kill pressure with his Misfortune Leona I think it's probably the right choice I'm glad we don't get to see the battery runs match up against Cody Simpson don't like you meet in an unfortunate with your against in the gates before it is like to risk you away from stuff but MF Hooksett. Cmdr the Twitter posting some of the designer where they at how would I tell people to find out if they haven't booked it I think right August is someone who had some bottled stuff actually hears about but it was just the mean Fest at the most ridiculous thoughts possible opportunity for us I would love to see more of the middle of orn because I think you can watch a lot of lanes and I also think this fits very well with the Olaf jungle till we haven't seen many Harry performances out of Grigg but he is trying to do so steer he can hard farm he can get an upgraded Black Cleaver and you can have this the rock of pumping him up into fights where if he just gets jungle enchant as well as Black Cleaver you can probably just kill Kodi time to filios when everyone have is do you want a battle at two teams tied for fourth place right now theme on the right hand side dignitas had a 3-0 start if I hate maybe they're real top performer of the drive to 3 the top team in the league right after they got to see Chanel stack up against hundreds by themselves for quite a while actually I think a lot of people had some fairly low some of them quite High 3 + 3 is not too good for the average performance I think there's a very good as well and that was previously the game turn it up and then the pecking order is defined throughout the weeks of the season right it's not the end of the world would it seem like Team Liquid starts at 2 and 5 but it's part of the process so both of these teams are in the midst of the process of trying to become great and both of them being a three and three it's just a great time to match up all right here we go Knight costume here to set up standing by Elton card take away buddy thank you very much I am here with pink card first question there is obviously the 03 that has been happening for dignitas what was going on in the minds this week to make sure that the team could end that just so we put effort into smuggling down and making sure that we've had really productive practice throughout the week and we performed really well in the latter stages still going to this game I think we're just really confident we know that if we play well we can be any team looks like you can take almost any fight with this composition what was the goal coming in this game when you got that in track just saw this Rocco Olaf of was showed in lck and pretty much the whole place can take anyone be one because the other straka with him so you just kind of play efficiently and just make sure that you're defending your space getting the place is first and like I said if we play well I know that we'll get the result we want think I thank you so much for the Insight gentleman take it away I like those lines do defend your space get there first and as long as you're there you can take any fight look for then you know if they can't ask him can control where were the old office and make sure they actually get control over that right now going to start with a solo blubaugh start and let his dueling get Lane control down there yeah yeah I'm always interested in following the jungles around but also in game form Happy's unconventional top laners like a suraka Aur Sona how do both teams decide to approach it as a something I'm trying to investigate a lot because I kind of have a theory that it's the next big thing in Halo or intro League of Legends like we seems to rock a dominate to move to Almost 100% band we'll see what ends up happening when it moves to other and check support think if we end up seeing more Sona the main question I'm trying to answer is you play around it or do you isolate and what's better for both teams that's often times I see I like the dinner talk to him isolated who plays elsewhere and then the hundred do you steam rice to like shut it down and kill it but I wonder if that's even the right call because if it's a supportive picking nature and you're putting your attention toward shutting down the support of pic are you not then just allowing the other teams carries to thrive right that's the question I'm trying to go through right now and I want to see what we do and how to do sex with corset be quick to buy start in the ground that level 3 in the ground on the top side of not very far from The Duo impressed with his early if you want to play a huge help Arlene Optical restart got a lot of hope for us Cody sun and you know when you're on the caliper several people leave that they did not going to trade with orthodontist jungle videos still have a full Camp to clear and affirm who's being a little brat Redbox right now maybe Tony doing a lot of folk on this Infantry genset yeah and one of the big differences between Soraka top and some of the other enchanter tops that you see like Sona is you're not actually building this report item on this one because you can generate enough Cs and have enough weight cleared just with your to spam I think the main strength of this pic actually lies envious being purchased that you run first it seems a little weird right to build the Seas against a physical damage top laner like set but the really isn't about the lane it's about generating the essenes charges later Andrea spending them throughout the process of a team fight because you have a very low cool down heel Likes to Rock It in W so but from the looks of it it doesn't look like there's much attention being spent up here and who needs is going to try and farm out as best we can to get sprayed himself a spot or the gun a lot of a car for now, he's not taking Berry or a lot of us Rockets do take Barry to try and dissuade the camp since you are vulnerable who needs pushed up and vulnerable no barrier what's your freaking get away from this one goes to the movies flash to the pole that gets the sun to punch has been running down worth with the flow afterward hop a wall in the way teleport coming in from Ryoma how do you had already been able to recall sweet but now he's going to be late in the Middle Lane that's holding the waif as who need to be back in the shop that there's a lot to unpack right there right there were able to get the kill but I mean afro has been roaming this whole time Houdini real played at the Dodge on Media Center Point Blank Q or The Mists depending on how you end up buying so much time show remember has teleport no barrier and the Q will end up stealing him over time so make something of a long way around really need to be able to land at Q get the controller and the Flash and if this too has time to return the house to him he actually lived through that one so practical II end up keeping him alive is there a route there ganado but doing okay over all this game is by the way tied in to kill coming through she's going to go first but if you count the assistant that believe yeah there was four set farming overall the whole lot 45 amp lead in the jungle going to pay for them a call that he and River fight all right here comes the orange horn hog hog knocked up as well but these cues are not Landing in the flask if Grandma waiting for the damaged walked out River control still going over to dig Aaron's Q by Greg there but I think the flash would have been burned regardless and I don't know probably lives in either case so look for a lot more of this if Jenny tossed enforce these plays go forever control use the push they have from the orange booties level sick now so wherever they fight you have to account for that ultimate typically even like in the bottom weight of Afro move tries to go for an all-in or even if hundreds of tragedy company have to think of that the rock salt in the back of their head by the mid size for most rushing in the way but is down farm for that was Coors beer apartment a few things back to the Top Lane to help the dive not happen but overall doing okay on the Rockets draft in Lincoln City out someday with his opposing Lane are pushed out does get to top the charts and medium ever active sure he's down his pants and she has a level 12 the video of the Xavier is frogging or support halfway but that is a TP on cool down now is mini splits in the Frog and loosen entire wave on the mid lane, shoves it and now they're going to fight by the upper level afro could go for the engage as well and as you said media has low for the dragon kind of plan B side across an entire plane wave to help control that dragon who's the better trade across the map do because roggen did lose the mid lane wave but somebody wants to talk to him because he walk down towards mid to kind of regretting the five-man play a lot of patients there showed bye-bye dignitas actually we're great decided not to all intermittent have numbers but you still managed to dissuade the play and he told me just gets very low there so now the frog is kind of return too late I wonder if 6 is started up yeah I don't think that anymore
Ghana's kind of logic art battle CLG with the dubious honor to the only team left with one win but they did look a whole lot better today came back the four times in the head is not accurate 61459 450 SM Immortals if they win are actually tied for second place which I think is far beyond what a lot of people work for this is Muddy there a fairly enough it's not that they're playing perfectly but they are picking up wins right and I think the saddest know very good for them early on in the team versus Team who I think their goal is goingp-play Austin's making it there at and trying to come through from that point they've been looking a lot better than some of these death squads of expected big things out of early on NBC LG or those teams are looking at us and top free top scorer in ligue 1 and 4 it look like and what is the squad was crowned in the middle and he has not been having a good year very very low damage or actually worse The Landings at Fannie middle interfere in the league right now and it's been all falls to fix that yesterday or the day before I do want to see if it's akin to put on another cave appointment for youyes you did pick up a win an Academy but before that it was like six seven losses in a row from if you hadn't played all of the Academy games so I know that that is a bit tough I think mentally to get through I'll just have to remember that they did get their win with the rock on a Friday night and I don't know if they're going to be able to get back to that pic is that will be left available in a session we are going to the second round of mad that you want to go for that type of play so I would not be surprised to see a Band Away by Mortals if they're at all concerned about it be what's the orange the Middle Lane and and hold on for the final counterpick but he's very very likely we should be sick next Once the bands are Real Steel gym grab their support either so that's going to be a fairly equal trade is a lot when there's an orangeMaytag Customer 80 damaged I don't think you're really going to want to give over this Ira Khan combo for free I guess you end times harder than ever I go but there's so many I don't think it was one absolute must fan and generally speaking diet only really play with her, these days at pro-level people feel that it is because that's that's fine I was going to play you know whatever so who cares what I was going to come through as the next go to engage support I still am quite possibly one of myself but not going to grab here just to Sandra Nautilus and now you get to seize the LG having to show who's playing Top Lane in and then let that orange pick the matchup we know rumbles like 3 midir for frown and I will see what ruins in a black pictureprobably drunk Appian what are the things that you're always going to give people talk about when they go to Nautilus is the liability I put my mouth on the 1st and I pressed or if they're going to get knocked up right where you can be the owner also passed away from Daft away from avoided many different ways and that is where I think the kids during a lot of times when these two Champions are being compared but it is going to be the owner with the possibility of diving on to die a year is a very strong Hill Lane Leona can walk people down for The Misfortune ultimate you do have the ability especially post sticks for the hundred to zero combos now the objective lens Off winner atrox oclock bin of note Soraka was still available to be picked was fan to pick their so now the mortals can Flex in shoes the top laner they want to play still got to be if he was a top of a magnet last time around now what is it going to be enough and Ohs up there and it could have been staying up top and his beer coming into the mid laneokay very interesting so it is going to be a deer into Rumble obviously you are going to outrage the rumble quite a lot but Rumble does have very good push in the early game no pain pain of a block is your under the threat of times and it's here is much more of that ceiling pick you do need time to get things going Rumble as soon as you hit stick to really are ready to go to fight around these objectives Aika it seems like it's going to be kind of that late game and there's a tremendous amount of scaling on the immortal side if it does go late I fear fear of their mom's very heavily when you're a kid and considerations the guaranteed engaged and Nautilus and Horn the or upgrades as well as diet and his gear for those big hypercar eat in the late stages but feels he has a lot of ability to be able to make things happen early great ganka to stand there with his Leona Group up with Lisa and make things happen along side of very powerful a leaf ultimate with the rumble of mass that is really great fighting a new subject has and that really has kind of been the name of the game into a petall right well here we go comps on your screen to get more dog chance to start but it still got was so good last time might just see it again it'll be just me one notch for I think it's worth looking at Immortals as a squad what they've done so far this year they had actually year-long a very very bad early-game them and coz the only spots under a thousand average gold deficit at 15 play slaughtered the early game last time around if they can stay on that form I sent a whole lot of work done for them and I think so much that credit is deserved or that early on the rack. I really felt like he was everywhere make multiple trips up to the topside be able to get advantages for so as what she's been made good on we know he can get similar things done on the Elise another really powerful early-game gankerI will see what he has in store for us here in the immediate things I'm looking to and it is that very surprised by the barrier on Rubble here for crown that is not something I've really ever seen taking hear nobody Rumble generally that is very very common and throw down the warden at least that's not a huge loss but have to burn the trinket and you know Gabe Solis you see a lot of class right and there's a ton of CC there but that being said barrier is if you dwell no really really powerful defense of Sumner you know what is going to absorb more damage than you would kill you for so that can be quite nice and if you're looking at a potential kind of aggressive plays to be scrapped shield and barrier it can be surprising how much you can really absorb them on one of the recent nurse.Rumble was that Frank one's craft shows got nerve quite heavily and that is the last kill you actually do level of which means you're going to be sitting on that Nerf capture really was about twenty less shielding I believe it was already in the past was like 13 days but I'm pretty confident that's the Centre change regardless of what we've got bought literally push your people to Squaw Taco Bell and it'd be pretty easy trade back PC smoothie sits in front says I'll be the one thing to yank her I would ask you right back and get my contacts back on so that was just your problem I think my husband is back and forth yeah I kind of expect when you push year but that being said there is potential to kind of combat that MF does a pretty good push up her own and we are going to see them take this timewhere is always really nice and kind of get Award of a bit further into your bonus jungle you're off and going to get more information from this he sees that the crowds are actually up with his word that he get placed they're both these camps have been warded Redbox was the start which we already know is gone so just give you the information that we went to the topside and as soon as we leave goes anywhere down that bauxite is going to be one of those to Camp so they're going to have the information where he would be how to stop then we'll see if the leasing can get anything done at all then it's going to be a Farm Fest of note ruin has the highest jungle proximity of all top laners as Wiggly ends the topside jungle he's up towards with a stop when you're pushing trying to push Pops that came through as well and look at the chickens are his and make sure that's going to stick junglers cosecant squared it out and it didn't see who knows he's still up on that top side knew he hadn't shown on Ivy'slittle Raptor alive they're worth very little experience as far as the total picture so it's almost always worth leaving one little Raptor up just as a counter jungling movie it's so much experience is in attic rafter and how does a three-man play specially for them it might be done and very similar CS overalls with you going to stay out of the map actually it was the bottom side of the predicting the lease and recall and maybe he can come off at Crooksyeah we'll see if he does catch him there will be going to kind of get a little bit of the bad news is that timing it was a little bit later we realized you were started that camp and then if you send us don't want it, because weekly did actually spotted on the way over there and his father is closer it's really too risky flavors for Crown oculistas bottom side of hello from a w a t Point Shield of rank one so it is free Nerf trap shield and Crown feels comfortable enough name is coming out from the year that crime has to be respectful and if we can or were you pretendingturn the flash on Chrome Twitter flash of the Cuban chose not to laugh. Why didn't the flash for that killed that that's a guarantee field even if someone comes in actually get you afterwards that should have been first weather for crown and honesty a pretty big mistake it seemed like from Aika I think he just did not save a soldier to actually be able to leave at 4 it's been frowned recognize that went for the olym play if you hadn't even without though I think that should have been a kill us a recall and release some Lane pressure but yeah that could have been so much bigger in the mid lane and Crown who's been having troubles this year finally Landing face even if only moderate the question is can you make good on that is being down the flash because if you can maybe we'll be able to call up smoothie and try to make it 3 minutes play try to get something done there there's no plans. He's gone I got so the owner + weekly coming over if you can maybe punish that but I think that should be the focus for CLT for the next coupledo you really want to get something out of that all right now it's back to farming for the jungle as he was real in Spanish oven tops item had the decency to pick up a lot of it again W look at all that beautiful a we damaged and I see cleared out there and if she's back up to actually get wrestling is a really good thing I'm by so as I'm sitting pretty much dead even here with ruin we knew that we knew was playing a lot on that table setting that because of the wording of Dave done so he was going to have to sit back in the early Lane that is kind of weird war and can sometimes get an advantage in these Millie matchups and that was taken away from him so much for being up Farm in that situation because Russian for friend as you have a topical stuff today and going to get caught. If I ruin and we can see some Midland freshman out a little bit at barrier plus the Mercury very very defensive setup your broken crown see what you can get done it is Xfinity moving his way towards mid-length and it was forever for a bit of a playcare I think Immortals are are sensing the fact that heals you may want to try to capitalize on that flash being down so they were trying to beat me in that area to difference is gone entirely that was burned to get the minions back for Icon yeah he's still up about a wave a farm over also add really doing what I would look like with a kill for Crown but and the day of the game state where it's a lead in the bottom side Roofing a difference as All That Glitters Is out but I'll take a NyQuil have been having a pretty big Lenny face with lace and Missy going to find us. Louis stolen but pretty good just walk away back to his teammate the blue steel gun was really good against this year and that was most 1hp bi-weekly donation of that flew Bellefontaine be happy to receive it just break is going to go over with the pickle outfit year 50 Gold by yourself and indeed grab that one remaining $200 plus the consequence of blue steel I've been worried about that so give them a bit of an edge there and help them to maintain the event they've already paid for themselves one of them spells going sister fanfiction X-Men and a half or so so not too much time until I can has that flash back in about a quarter of that cool down black soap but over a minute and no visits really from CLT to wear that Midland so no Advantage now
we are into this match here as we begin my fault it's never your fault you're right if this is a Bad cast it's all on me and you know I will live that one down to record of the defending Champions 03 win so far this place it's her first kind of on paper easy opponent in the ALCS if one else. Have Team STL should be taking care of business here just hold the dark easier for them but despite the fact that they don't have peroxide and they have been playing in 14 I don't think we can give him a pass on all of their issues because this is still for 5th with basically an All-Star team last fall for these guys first floor 1st Team all LCSkeeping everything in the office and they haven't known as much time into we are expecting the ramp up in for better individual available for clothes right away for turn fire and I want to spend a little time contrasting these two junglers because one of the complaints I have seen from TL players are very true and is that closer is the number one done with the LCS he's actually just Farmington fire is second to last in Chula Vista 15% and she's actually I'm not really lame and I don't do anything cuz it's obviously something difficulthow to hide the best performance isn't even without a sad about double us after we to add to lotion on the proximity of any bot Lane in League with you but not getting the outfit he may be used to know she'll often it's hardly has played heavily around bot Lane and they keep going back to it and I've got to say I'm so surprised it just does not seem to fit their place out, but it is a pic that is very strong the met a lot of people are performing with it so you know they are kind of Bixby screen popular you know especially when you open a clta Santa's not really played very much at all their music list 10-4 kind of rising up and take you fought alongside at math and if Elio's which are obviously not available for sale to grab at that point of the draft but see if they can kind of play around a little bit differently and finally get a win under their belt with his because traditionallyfilter on him since he was the guy that plays with the ultimate supporting your style and I have your other utility of of the shroud of the heels and it's like its purity test output is lower than a lot of these other chances are Leos Cindy sent us a note 4 minutes of worldwide in for a flight is it from it is three-quarters of the Senate average worldwide per gold in here as well he is not getting his numbers up over time if you have a number one more out of the bottleit's very interesting right because it went when you do see a weakness like this among the few teams are going to draft for the every single time they're going to try to push you toward that weakness if that is perceived that way you know one of the things that people used to do is yell in the draft in the past is they would you just blindly expected impact of playtime right boob free counter pick a tank and then kill would grab the tank anyway right it's like they blind do you think this is something that can become an issue for Cialis over half the reason they're going back to the Santa to get some window to the belt with it and prove that hey we can play that you can't just create a whole draft around 4:20 of course if there's going to 83 North the next to the last game he ever fly on 10.2mobile over-the-top like this Misfortune the other side and said to not have dashes it's so damn difficult to play safe against a 4-foot galio you had Rumble and Ken over top that gets even more difficult than it does it take to die very easily as you're saying also on top easy to hit the damaged with a cataclysm hitting someone down but also the shielding is going to be there for your for divers and this does seem like an intelligent traffic to have to see if golden Guardians can kind of feel it apart a little bit a lot of poking be available here from the Zoe and if they can get the proper setup for the MF ultimate that can be very effective alongside Buena Vista Co diving in with the lease in but that being said it's very difficult every kind of get the opportunity to stand in fire with this MF Bowl against this composition because equalizer can be layered over top of you if you're ever in range of Jaipur ghallywood they are going to be looking for you so if you're really strongI think I was FBI and perhaps a little bit of Side Lane play where aatrox I think can take over in the later stages against these type of pants and a big thing I have my eyes on a very different role in this game or away from The Incredibles. Behind behind Grandmasters Gilligan 6754 Centre on Pacific so I do think if there's one hand from sometimes a brain or to the coordination problem we are from their coach in narrow to pick up the minutes ago saying that you know sometimes we make one call Italy to the keys or he committed to that first call and he's theleft out to die that's not always his fault so we'll see if coordination will step up here for Golden Gardens or if liquid can end of the week tied for third place with three wins to get ourselves on the river see what happens what is looking like we're going to get kind of the NuWave build here for Canon something that has been very popular in the lck is Kenneth overall is a pic but actually conqueror and gunblade you need to have a tremendous amount of self-healing here to play War for the Laney face about a full year ago that have been somewhat popular along but it was more play like we say in Hindi sexy things for quite some time at the pro level but it is kind of swung back once again to this Russian word gunblade 2 worth playing for that lane and that's oddly Domino so you have to really track how much impact can get done because if you're good to go for this field and you don't get it is it that you don't have a pressure bandage you were just weaker in the team fight without having fun of them all right we'll see what they can do for this one impact go down the hole Precision tree gets the extra energy on killing us as well friends of mine does work energy Champions so C250 Max Energy somewhere at some point here unless you get some booty shot out and nothing to spice what happens in the early game equip trinket world that I believe double is spotted so they know which way they come out and if turn far does level to gank then far is indeed AutoZone Red Bluff and you cannot really lame me mobile release coming through for Haunted House close Argo a bit faster that should help in case there's any kind of weird truly game invade pasta Short Pump yeah I can have to track if he can get in involved early on here does look like a closer is going to be doing the exact same path and he is going to be buff up straight drop thank you very much for a little bit of info coming out from TLC do do I saw the Senate Pig being picked up by double at the last week he said that he doesn't believe sent as a very good Champion or that he just doesn't want a player I just got finished don't know what he says it double it is fine with the champion he likes playing Center and he enjoys that and he know he's not too bad at her in the plane so that's my two bit of information for you guys do with it what you will blink twice if they're making you play Santa buddy he also love bugs soda last we'll see if he's going to be all smiles after this one I know isn't always the biggest of guilt but if you expected to have foot on the top side and is going to be closer looking for still have that Smite but clothes are early advantage and and gold and blue has a great spell thief grabbed there with the ignite so that can help to have a little bit more pressure in this to between basic course by the Stars women at Jen's been asleep but Jake doesn't come through a little pretty much by the space is a big waves to fall in the mid lane should type the farm over all across OSU players for the top expected for impact there is not good on the back foot the top side that's what you get for getting counter picnic and coming through you can't contest every ranges between your honor trip because you're going to take too much her up early overall so we'll see how Hunter does in his early Lane if you can prove stabilized you generally go down and her so she s and then from there if you're playing it while you can come to slow that down and try to keep the Gap at that point tops, cuz everybody clean the strain fire is going to be first little for in that Caswell doublelist Anchorage AJ there double its do flash also means you get a pretty horrible to Dex the possibility is there more closer to make a move down flat bottom side I can't be more hyped than like Everest climbing on Keith and he straight-up two-on-two first floods doublelift down the book was already coming out the devil thought he was they thought he was behind that minion he grabbed him and from there it was pretty much lights out I do think it was smart to not use that you'll I do believe that wasn't and shoulders from that point I think summer is just going to be wasted so CC accept his death only positive for TL side is that the first one went to keep instead of two FBI or so the itemization know it's not as bad as it could be between those two Mark then still a pretty big deal though ExtraTorrent and extra long sword on top so that bottom Lane to be heavily you want to point out it wasn't three some of those burned for 2 so there is a Tumblr vintage back in in liquids favor to get a new game coming through crucially FBI himself has the flash but of course he does not see that comes to matter pretty soon but if I want to go difference what's Golden Gardens in the early lead most out of course buoyed by the first let itself because back in the flame it turns out here as well as himself and he should have known that for an is there if you do place. That means they absolutely no they haven't, can quitting but if they can actually put you in that wave and reset it they have enough to do so for JJ spotting clothes are there will be backing off now but no Jensen Zoe it was kind of hold this Lane pretty equal you do expect Rumble often times to have the bush but closer has been pretty active around this delayed that is going to make you hesitant to fully commit to it at one point I'm not actually is across the five teams played so far going to lose has almost identical linnig's out to Jensen very slightly better for rent in in CSD goal-difference and very slight lower overall turn the proximity they're not even having to put you to the game during golden boots has been in multiple games were always result in win and that is not just as old as this thing is it's nothing but they need to get to a point where they can take it then turn those into a you know it's not as though this has been a team sitting at 1 and 4 that it's just in case they actually had a lot of really close games that have some time just barely knock on their way to convert those bit later on 4th right now we're seeing string it again look for the bottom lay in a rare botland gang 15 liquid with his jugular and this could be the play at the time and could not land to eat to stop it nicely done by Keith's Landscaping out Dasher and try to actually got the paperwork on that Lantern I do think he was a split second too late that the lizard had already been grabbed by FBI so I think would not very effective insurance that think I don't think it was spotted at 8 and not walking through that brush so it may not know they have the flash if you do it wrong at all that is someone that can roast a jungler very very closely so you do have to be careful about that but they are looking for a date now on this Blue Book they've had Vision they have had some priority
little thing that I would it take from last weekend in Josh's one watched about the bottom line because I have also been very positive on everybody was really wondering if you can let us be on stage but they did have a really deep in Richfield Play where is teleport with relay out of that seemed to me or him whatever whatever but the teeth wait not quite Instinct Last Time Around in delivering to toss their first loss off the band's here. Lance with kids and will first pick that set-back baby that is incredibly strong whoever he did lose over in game 1 of the base maybe it's not as good right now or who knows the rock up is available and a very good top laner of course her spell the philios on the board for Johnson drafted by The Misfortune right away is a side of the tableis a lot of forward pressure FL this is one of these Slater in League of Legends you can all in this guy talking about, to execute to if you want to try at home Oak Hill Lane with your buddy Misfortune and Leona is the way to go because you hit Level 6 going to kill someone promise been picked up by ding Tai to try and stop that Ron's idea obviously but if you're on breakable when the ultimate come through try and block that I went in my experience you just still kill the Rob maybe throw the combo down there still will be very volatile and especially if a jongleur his present that is what he has them are going for me. Last week DSM looking more aggressive they were much quicker with their games I think they're average game-time literally dropped 20 minutes from Week 1 to week 2 andwe thought, doing offensive volts forward with diarrhea flashing forwards do you know the team is looking to create their own advantages rather than sit back now so I'm really excited for this match up to 3 how well dignitas that actually played up Turtle this point for plaid pick they don't want it to counter a frog and style Champion smoothie my thinking he wants a big obviously things are going to be more susceptible to go to Stockton stop playing counterpick and if they wanted Midland kind of a cute as well I just talked about. Octo for a second he is 300 and 3 a year long in the first 15 minutes he's actually doing a ton of work for dicen in the early game what he talks about MSBL to being a good bottom and the Gang for Canon versus set is I was going to be a whole lothard but we'll see what made in bottle look like and I expect. Off to get the better be really good match up here this is a very moody style top way match up kicking the can in there waves at jungle I mean theoretically yet he was speaking it into CEST it can be rotated to Jungle as well so deftly juglife a lock of the kale I don't know but yeah but I mean I think it really is going there like a really good wine and set isn't up with your Ford Artic so that's his 52 champion and 5 pics they got the flex to put the final match of the Brooklyn wants to play and broken Place had a really good week to be put in a lot of damage of a lot of work and you can start top Link in a bowl for match up with you really can absolutely take over the scannerespecially if your gate work at 10 to what are we go super long-range Great Wave clear you back to W quickly beaded top window as far as I know and I talked to a lot of Frozen versus all the time trying to get tips and tricks but they have all been in my opinion I had more fun with it because she might give you more Mobility than you're used to on top like that so any extra Mobility does feel really nice however in the jungle position it is much more difficult to fund a build of Trinity Forest sparex style and they're just dance is Way Out Of Reach the super hard like big hairy crazy unkillablestyle built are much more are in the jungle unless you are super popping off very very frequently do you get these full tank suspender hog full Defense battles I took those are actually really effective if you can get stone plate because witness little bit of snowflake you can really soak it up and you still get out a Baker's you still feel want to lay in the middle for two damaged stuff I think it's going to be a little bit different to look from set then we stopped from broken plates which was amazing for CSM and got them there went last week that will see if I can return the favor all right through the game we go as TSM indignity battle she gots what's 3 + 1 * 12 mm back to the LCS and frog and gets his battle with Purex in this time around he's got a real team see what I can do for himself as a gun with a wreck right where's the dick chance I forgot couple who like to have parted lips Duke's more constructive I think he makes us feedback little bit more constructive than before when I first run TSM he was there's a little bit too much red you know little bit too much of like emotion now it's a lot more constructive so I would say that's part of his growth that's one way to put it is always red energy by the way always Flav anyone in the vicinity even if he doesn't have any malice towards them about it off just because he thinks it's funny shut up Kobe stats it's really nice to hear that you know people everybody that goes in and out of DSM que Fue Tu Auto Lee Broken Blade pop it off in the early Lenny face still got a proportion Charges going there use it for the extra burn on his trade won't have that much sustained left for himself though so I could see the damage oh yeah couple of grounds there for some people Farm while he was pushing up to so not only did you miss one as well but also so you got a good trade in their the earlier stages of Elf eyes are a little bit more finicky until you can get your super clean it's the double w cat decides that good stuff. No Broken Blade out of church Branson take one tears are for the auto I maybe take that one nice play the Broken Blade yeah I definitely take it he's also fixing it up here on Hootie let's see if he how he deals with jungle difference though because oftentimes you look at a matchup in isolation and think I owe what was a good trade or bad trade is this even of winning match up well that he knows that he's drunk with his bottom side of the map could have been there but we'll see if they win this almost too slow if you ever goes left and right now that has to be a flash you can react to that with your reflexes we found isotemp right there I almost want to go back there looking at Midland because that was the difference between our first game and this game you're still hovers down to the bottom side of the map where they have a Ward safety side on the bottom side so he doesn't put himself out there for the elite what I could prove you're talking about there's a trait of low at the bottom side and yeah that's what you get with Brom the biofrost we just far more help and I remove does they do push the wave Endo so now they got time to Rome they can go get a schedule because Leona has a stud in her kid I should feels really nice if you can take that as a bottom lane Maplewood Dr. Crossing mid though he wants to claim the jugular Bounty that's gold is rightfully his but right now it's pulling back to color for app cash money in the pockets there you go meatball drag just taking the high gold Camp of crud take the recall 5 campden but you've got more farm and more dunnottar like right now have you looked at the bottom side but I think it's life is so unlike with healthbars is full of say are they cutkosky at alright challenging spy for him as well so he's not even going for the stroma sure saver doesn't want doesn't even need the extra Mobility we will have to check if he has Nimitz logo cuz he has sorcery he's letting them is Cloak and he's running water walking who's running the movement speed portion of the story secondary tree so that both the Red Flight will still give him some speed right nipple got changed this season the movie on summer spell Houston ultimate use so just like it's running it's not nearly as effective as skirmishers Naperville with the I found it so why even take go down with it but we've got a lot of course they're going to have the extra defense as well goes a long way for jungle set cuz of course you are going to be lower in Gold so they need more combat effectiveness of the topside fight may go back and forth 143 cowesett Broken Blade to grab the United Farm closed and locked back to Lane fragen have to walk away is bjork's in teepees in let the first reset through that documentary temperature for AC Pro Controller the area busbar 40 at them because they get a recall out of frog in this Dragon play may look bold but that's all because Rock and reef out there so they know there's no possibility of Midland coming in it is because of the difference in the Summoner spells here so he doesn't want to get pictures done combo your dad uses to teleport and get some a dragon like weed on there it would pick up there right has the upgrade its might use the W-2 form a lot of damage heal back up as well and that's a nice way to pick up there and put it on the board for TSN goldstate little bit dignitas favorite nice trade right there could suck don't you come down I'm pretty good for a lot of spots actual gold is bust a little bit cuz you can talk to you think again trying to find this gate for Greg formerly on Dirksen steam just be months ago now against them hope you can find some pick up there not going to cross the midline spotted now they know he's bottom side is afro recalls away I'm still sitting at connecting to pretty close early game broken play topside checking back in with the earlimart Reds versus Canon I actually do like it a lot of people playing a lot for tenacity but can in studs are the real thing you have to worry about flexing your getting your double Effectiveness out of your magic resistance because it's Annelise jungle so it's the perfect by a hard crowd control NFL you still going out there it's like you've definitely Always by Merck Forest if you do not exactly the correct Choice there to see it on the set as well and probably Leona although movies once again waiting around for next day display a text about a fairlead awful early game and the attempts of gangs were there they sat in the side brush but no real fight been happening about us going to learn from the first try that you can't really eat and then brown spotting early so are their training Farm back and forth switching inflamed very best food for themselves and we're approaching the 8-minute mark are so the pushing team which is, a vile Frosty reports he has them should be able to get there are retail swap off if they want looking at top side right now who needs does that the ultimate ready for himself but hopefully I can bring the watch that fight as well and early because he's got the cooldown reduction year of roopa in preparation for this fight if they force the back from fogging again it will be another neutral objective okay well pushing in right now is hell's going to be going down at 8 minutes 20 mins game and this is definitely TSI math teaching you control the topside they fly the middle and ending up there as well and now it's working late Samantha decide to put away Harold picked up bring him back around but no good fight and look at that shreds means you don't get chain CiCi's out of your tenants done all the plastic all the ultimate coming in play today's top hits first what with the flash has taken there actually goes to deep under the tower lock them up in the end and that stun is enough to get to kill under the dower turning the kill back around on them take another look at him chasing him down. And even I would say even this far
are you playing tomorrow or Sunday there's no there's no double elimination they cannot get first because EG has already guaranteed that but dignitas if it would hear there was a top for the group they're playing quarters it's going to be fine if they do that's fun I think it's really important here if they're going to ban to Leah or not I like leave this up as the question for 9 to leave the one jungle champion at did guys have a win on right now for gardocki look really good at it as an elective 20 Deck with pointing out the jungle matchup is so big for these two teams because bladder has been the biggest carry just why all the hype around perks you know coming over to North America palabra has been huge and carry Nampa and Italy it is left up so now we get to pick or is it going over to the other sidecancel first pick to Lionel Lee comes in right after their dogs going to go to that one as well we always ask what is the Mythic that was going to go for it as much as I like designs in the 2021 season Sakura like they pick Lillian she has like four items choices which an outstanding late-game carry going to be in love with a belly Austin I went through this. Where did everyone hated himself but I think is it in a very good state right now it's simply very strong and Ice Cube you choose to eat by potential especially once you start I know accumulating your items but allistars a really good pic into a pile of not looking out Hearts do you see here it's another really important thing when you first pick to Leah you're always lookingsolo laners that also have hearts easy to set Billy up because that makes her devastating easily Lander seismic shove that's where these big Wombo Combo has come from those things like rain next in also looking for possible to set up in Midland to to give you versatility and to allow perks the Roman work with Lattimore and so is going to be that kind of slowed things down maybe you can lend someone away if they're coming out to Alistair lens that but through pulverized where the seismic shop in the new Housewives there before your flashes every ending pasta bowl so can be really scary their local bands going away for a skirt out of here you could gather again I'll stable here as well. Do you want to see how fudge end up doing cuz he's not been outstanding but why is Bill fighter going to drop the table for most deep youngest player in the LCS and came in talkingexcitement to the games we'll see see how he bounces back this week definitely struggled a little bit early on a proxy error with the second round bands are there may have some of the sea all around or top laners the healing right now is really really strong on eight. So he's come back as one of the favorite blind pics and put thing to us are probably going to have to stop and save their mid for last pic trying to whittle down on the generalist top laner could blind fix guitar Spanaway Laurel to get rid of some more the midline option Sarah first we'll see what comes through plenty of options available down the line As Time ticks down I'm your wreck in Oregon that's kind of what kind of third in line to take us over something like a reactant in a lot of cases but hahayou know technically a blind. Late but we've seen so many teams punished minion are and attacked these Nar flares early on that it it makes it look like no such a weakness so dick. So I could fall into that trap they do with the other one it is Gangplank very good at absorbing freshener using the ultimate you do for a wave clear as well you have a lot of options with how you want to play Gangplank you can play Super aggressive Leaf off the bat level one user packs if you do you're going to have to declare Pathak topside to do my dance in the rain just barely hear they'll pop the Peril stay out of the range of a barrel of the Baskervilles jungler with means you can still put pressure in and get orange out of sight Midland for 9good match up really early on I am really really looking forward to the level one possibilities here though detox with a Lilia and a threat can definitely go for that level one in Vape play Far Cry by swap Authority on Toledo Bend or there's a chance but they stopped pact was fine but I was like I said there was a possibility that we're going to Jason's probably a better syndra Mattapan or E might be normal stuff down here good like it carries them both sides to follow up the EZ of course to lie again old and Lantern to bring Kelly s or a jungler or someone else and I'm not expecting bottling is the place of all players in this game Vulcan is the one with a hundred percent First Blood rate so if there's a if there's going to be a kilt if you are in bottomland with Venturi X or over to Mid for perks but you know the mass right now is going to be smoking as far as the first week of the walking wet he has been farming up a storm highest yes 4 minutes of any player on any of the teams and he's also been a huge huge point for bladder to then go work off towards the bottom side of the map so definitely agree with the focus they're not too surprised about the general esteem cops that they've been looking for this way to try and secure themselves a spot in the quarterfinals though very important match for them absolutely took the toss can they lock themselves in we got to see there will only be a tiebreaker game if there is a three-way tie involving the dignitas Immortals and flyquest otherwise it's five games today in altizer broken based on game time and such only tiebreaker if there's a Battle Force 5 full a recall stop there for bladder even though I'm going to the same work around and you know now he knows and if you want manaflow band you got to stack there but you know he's a dick it could be there alright let's see if there's a delayed invade actually almost always was he the jungle lyrics drop your trinket War then recall to switch back over to your sweeper as dark as especially for Lily and he's going to do pretty much mostly a full clear tries to get all our camp cycling before getting to active got the better of that trade 4th what's the origin of ball is close by you can just can't miss the cuso4 to Look Alot of q auto leave it at the same help our leader the passenger right now there was a fight back and forth for level two pork steaks EQ gets one back in pretty actually the Namek the early Winfrey's do with the corrupting potion to get plenty of Regents you can kind of survive this. If I don't think you just like texts Bells forever otherwise they're going to run out to leashless start on the blue 2 minutes but I can't is finally done so it's going to be a bit of a slow start is bot Lane wanted to make sure that getting late in time I mean it ain't like the reference Alistair you really don't want to have to come to Lane late or you're just going to have to drop CS like there's a hole just way that plays out and she never really fun so we go down to the lowliest a too sad about you don't know Leaf starts very good job hiding early on so you save so much HP can see you didn't have to use any post slick Willie up as long as you don't kind of just pants and date them and you actually use the passive roast beef and guide the camps around properly just fine and clearing it help or not nice like right there to be a lot of damage to the flaking is well and that is why you didn't take a fight Vulcan can never engaged or he will just dyed afro Neil with an ignite and I'm going to give see night so much less pressure in this lame down yes big opening here for aphromoo and Neo there were a bunch of questions circulating around the sin cos roster one of them was that aphromoo after putting in so much work last year and be coming and you know part of that big bottom Lane Forest for dignity how is he going to do try to raise a fund another new rookie in MiO me know after getting another shot here name change in all coming in so far pick it up right where they left aggressive play here with your failure scratch try to push the lane in trying to die some of those menus and retain control of bottom half of the map. I believe showed himself going over the sea salt the same Kentland the W does not live it's really good sites that buy perks means he's like I was a mole diver I'm going to go outside if it's cold down here honestly not not too big of a deal just keep on power farming through as you can see to blabber having done red side first gets to go over to Super high-value cruggs second spot of frogs feel so good that's why I love starting red and doing right side first clear for Tulia especially she has a really easy time of clearing that camp and and black was going to have a pretty big boost as far as the experience leave here. Meanwhile does get the second reset off a little bit later but Russia's Level Two Boots Lucidity has been gaining so much popularity Pro junglers trying to rush this with the with the ability hate as well really really does make a difference for Lilia I think of it is unlocked based on getting 5 slide off and he has some very good jungle clear staff because I can't get the sooner you can earn more gold by running faster and that's obviously pretty important they are as well they're trying to get the recalls office ways in a bad spot done can not leave the wave here but it's tough but you know can you really go for the play as well can get soaked he's just kind of going to die and it turns out to Lee is right behind them or so I can stay lilies are behind them leave the lights on the map stop it only person help with the extra speed Lance's bowling ball is well after calibrating at mid-day able to kill on his bed both Summoners implode for Sven and I was just talking about at the beginning of the intro as being dissed huge Kerry Forest for cloud nine they been playing so well honestly that was a well-controlled lane State buydig they went for the interests of the recalls they had to ward in that lane brush that stall Cloud 9 cancel on the reset and they do with the jugular position they were going to have it on our light Goldstar tickets cloud nine one of the biggest failures freak is when top laners continue to show up after they receive a gang from their own junk flapper recalls are goes back to his own jungle after helping a push up there then you're so exposed get you still feel like you have this relative safety as the top winner they just had your jugular come and gang for you so darn socks able to slip in just bottom side play the top side play level six billion ow oh my goodness. He's really set up here reporting to talk to rule this early game by next ice would be towards the dragons to say do have that bottom control having gotten off the successful gank towards that already and burn both his Summoners and establishing this jungle lead dig if they wait for the next school down for fake God's ultimate I think that is that is that should be 100% and their Drake look at it. I can see how it raining outside of Minion Vision wait for the flash for a free movie starts moving beautiful plastic wrap over by the way of the way that they'll are there so you see me immediately went for their gratitude there as soon as the client came off though. Already through the seed get the slow there enough to chase him down honestly just so beautiful so that you know they did double up on anything that would get double cleanse there anything like that yeah you by mention I might not have heard it but after holding off on at night until the gravity route was cleanse like us another one that would just go away if you could steal flashlight big night so really good stuff all across the board to Old startles you mentioned is a 1,000 gold difference that is kind of what you expect with 7 plus have that and assists and indeed. 10K so beautiful right now who has been good across the board as well you can see the CVS within 5 or every single person except jungle but I'll take to get over 310 everything Fry's but afro I bet it's time to walk away ending lever flash for nothing secure about their their spot later on in the quarterfinals in and this is really big for dick by Mandy sings just keep stacking up this early game is perfectly set up now for dignitas to fight the dragon not only do they have control over by Ed Baker Gangplank ultimate is coming back up but now whoever doesn't even have flash either
this game now as well as fixed in bands have begun Rumble darvina Cowley fan. All right let's see if we get any Soraka shenanigan in this game as well I would say it's it's probably should show up I know people have been throwing around possible counters to it today when I want them let it through and lose to it you can pick stuff to try and kill it and laying around those types of things for a full-bird Alexa or course the van here and if TLS play a Carrie 80s like I think it's I think it's fine I don't think he's like yeah she's fine but it but yeah it's not it's not quite the sameall right well they respond with the lesion van of their own and are you goes you get your diabetic a way we think I already told us he's not going to be out and I think that I would be a lot right now to overlook because one of the best players in the league like you could just do more than Douglas and almost any game State vote as as players in Champions combine that's to be really awesome here I think it's the last chance we come over you're not very good at the game Feed themselves should look pretty nice here I also why God I like the second round red skies picking your mid laner and then throwing up right after this goes you'll get first shot at it and then you get the band out counters afterwards but did you switch it up go for the Gangplank into the atrox want to unpack favorites. Got this many time and it also lends itself fluoride staining your ultimate quartz double and core JJ Williams Oxford Skin Clinic in the split for if you know Stephen very very well but Sunday is all about physical damage melee aggressive Fighters those third aatrox game now in 5 bring up to the toppling there for Sunday at the bands coming through from the jungle straight up and throw their weight about Royals playing that Miss still think he has jungle is really scariest mid-layer to play again because that is 100% of 0 if they have you know with the water blade guarantees Ruess projects with a flat screen TV as well so I can definitely not wanting to get snowball. So far that's so much stuff has been one of the weak points out skin liquid that he has to be going to a lane farming do y'all need a minute later and I can't be blind the block I think I would pick jungle here first those days your dick until you see everything from hundred thieves no reason to show your hand first thing you do free well done looking at we've been here for sure and fire possible early game moves but setting up with a lot of pick and play more of a split map in 200 thieves that usually will like to play 5-person Cottages just one that matches last game repeat up with TL wants to play themselves they would work pretty okay here's enough damn it. It's he's now need to support pick up what's wrong band away but left up could be Leona kabiling aggressive who will we have some very strong right now but well I fell into the time change lanes. I think it is a good last big bore son when you do have to Oriana we saw her last game then to match up here you can have the upper hand at level four first but jungler interaction means so much last game against ground hovering topside get games early dies in The matchups and also dies topside when he tried to go for the ones you wanted which is DJ so there's no easy out playroom there for the Oriana plus he play always does come into it but certainly all right I'll take a look at this one as a lioness are complete he must have got counter picks in Top Lane and Midland shrimps are on a ruler in the Leafs in for him TL like in my mind should look good on the top side as long as burn fire can kind of shake off of page Turners and play Wild Squad and I'm also looking at media because meteos is a player that has been map of LCS yeah really. Right there he's always been a cop after I go he said a rough start to this split but in this particular game 2 has a couple of options are there opportunities to go for game play game early on a chocolate and put the Gangplank in trying to get control of the Midway was you use to get up there you can actually try to push it back that's very difficult to do in fact is really good at taking toppling pressure away from the rest of mass of for JJ far point of the missing jungler that's the reason we're still great or even themselves up here cuz hundred thieves I feel very harmonious cat yeah I think those to work really well together you know I love how respectful our fans are till I can let the other half like get there half the fan to appreciate you what I want to say thank you very much synchronize chance coming through synchronize Riverdance as well the river King chords JJ gets priority though the nearest place his word yet he did so not going to completely really recall then sometimes you see ya you get your free drink at Ward then go back for the sweeper keeps canceling it though so I won't be the case this time I think it's going to hold on to it and have topside starts all right and say no crazy Shenanigans beginning this game I didn't look back to their assigned lanes and mediums will be if he wants to be on before the camps spawn but looks like that isn't on the way ping the Gangplank going to invade the blue box and say hey to do in that he is not it's going to be a wolf start with me just allowed to be to be safe there as far as the fro junglers right now has one of the weakest early start so often times in professional games will see teams that have gragas if the opposing team has any sort of level 1 logo for level 1 invade try to push him off his butt so I guess where is often times do you have to start these very small we can't beat us does that safely but if I was going to find him on the bus Anyway come to your level 2 with red and there's a 0% chance that you can finally send with Red Bluff there as Braga Sylvia's going to have to give up Priority in the jungle as is very customary for garden players and let us play on The Shield is down here comes in speak nicely done stops the counter jungle could go for a gank and I should know he can see him I think writing that that's a son that's a cute that is a lot of damage and the Flash and be careful truck show Amigos in champ select because he has had a rough start is on fire in this game he did not have to fight the red plastic piece in level 2 for him he let them do the work it's Carter Creek beaten by police in level 2 he just let him do the work on the blue pits feels that away finds him with Akil here teamwork and stunt Thrones up from the river run by the way like incredible and there are so many things in this replay because every time you show yourself on an early game as a jungler you can't just turn your brain off and then go back in Europe your own jungle like at the stage space because it's your jungle your side of the map voice out of Safe space reach there all the time to reclaim and a talent stunt is going to lead the charge on that one that was an awesome play we re Clement hashtag it could be positive this year that was beautiful so now he's pushing forward nice for the damage out there from Sunday as well as fact. all right everybody take a deep breath is a very significant lead I would say because it's this early in the game and in the way that has occurred start now go for another play just get the Comcast not a lot of Crockett roll the flavor to be there in just barely walks away that was not leave a trace back that hard and that is a flash down and the heel down to the bottom line is he's still looking to fire away video very active now that is that is difficult to to call when I get a flash on that play and pack holds it Sunday the same all right like I said there's a lot of opportunity for this gragas around the map videos make his presence felt bottom side versus AJ could have forced Team Liquid play a little bit more defensively down there someday doing his own work burning stomach has felt on the top half and building a big minion way the abyss meaning wave should get picked up by Impacto because meet us just shows bottom side and then he went back to the Jungle. Impact field very thankful that there is not a krakus here upon arrival from that teleport to fight him on that big minion wave that was stacked up and he'll be able to clean that up it will result in a six yes leave for impact by the way. Hook good spice to buy cherne calcite in the river 3 verses to fix you. combining on so many plays in this game Cody Sun also had grabbed it to Von evelio so they're able to get the days down Dragon will be acquired off of that River play a stunt and bloodthirsty Juke and Dublin had the Mind Games going it's away all right here's another play Sun going for the opening goes like this Pinos is here and they have a fellas coming up Vicky different bear Cody Sun Walk This Way up to the fight double with his farm in the mini way down on the bottom of your mini-map that you can see and you do with the last 4 words that got him with his hip up to play to secure that one and they chased down the Tomcats chill as well it's also result I'm in heading right back to laying here pushing it up once again very good early game right now per hundred thousand gold is certainly Within Reach for Team Liquid side fancy stay safe if the top seven African incredibly well impact of town who fixes up XI vs he's got that she's done all ready to fight this venues good dancer someday but in fact I pushed off the way the oranges cuties to get the grass tells back up but he's acting winning this race yeah after you use all your cues there on a fox a man has to back off from the trade impact able to start jogging on Crafting potion he's got biscuits upon arrival that's basically our game plan for the Gangplank in this matchup you sustained through it you farm up for the early stages and now that he's got his seen you can actually trade back a lot more effectively bigger Bruce Lee call Lee sit up there too often will call their jugglers and make them waste time if they can make anything out of this yeah I mean Sunday also has flash so many waves in a bad spot for someday though he really wants you to crash it videos right now on the Wolves going to sit there and finish the campout was sick of work Services good enough that he's not too terribly afraid nice might get around the barrel turns it around doesn't get the Q Damage Done to him and I video is heading towards the top side I will probably come by Lisa in Grandma's for Destruction as well as media is going to walk to division if it's got to just find out so not seeing where's it gone as well
counter logic gaming do battle I am free voicemail Kobe early here Lucian is going to find his way onto the list as well as super good flexible take right now that we haven't seen it actually drafted and played around that much if we can actually find some set action as well as the number one Harbor well I had been so much hey everybody would have to buy any more livestock forever or horses or whatever actually paid already has other couch doing up here I was groomed so maybe I will be dropping thehere and they can focus more on the stowaway that does go through I would always racing is defensive stats even if you get a difficult early Lane you're going to be such a big away from in Philly near The Chi-Lites yes I'm still hitting you bang is like the sea MS-13 in Vegas still in the DPM chart she has a top 5 player likes Vang BAC I think he's had a really rough time and na bangus playing very very well would you give a front-line He will carry you to victory Azalea's combination Jarvan very good at going for early game as we've already seen some players in the first week the second week I definitely had some over aggressive moves but if Elias also needs some defenses with him right places I have any don't feel any chances of any sort to Austin time we think either Tomcats or Brom drafted within the two most defensive support on Pinterest bad and they're actually not drafting Brom right now so it's going to have to be a more offensive look for the Cecilia and they're going to go for those killed Nautilus very high chance that it can go for the kill. Underwear work on dialing but slower sometimes it is more difficult to get off you're actually get good traits off on Nautilus you can go so quick and if you hit him with a W before you get to the audio out before he gets his golf you don't have aftershocks seniors I can actually jump out some good damage replace the evaporator coil and let me go through to the second phase and I like this band. Evil Geniuses vs Dean College gaming put kale for ruin in a previous that match epic good skills you can grab a close to winning the game where they were so far behind because the champion good band all the same and that means it's at Banfield Kendall jungle targeting here maybe the rexha gragas the most Providence Pro jugglers and then for the Top Lane band year for EG probably another range to match up for set things like kale and rides that can diffuse that early or really difficult to deal with today go with the mordekaiser actually split a while because he's death row every single game they've played so far just calling the fact that he's maybe doesn't have at least in the pool or not scary enough that they don't care about the Champions but it's played like that pic band Champion stop playing stop playing matchup Soraka should be able to farm Define versus debt so I do like this secondary pick up here are we talking about movies campus around but that's what the highest probability for stuff like that pretty early on as well you'll have to worry too much about that top side of mad because we had that big affected challenge is accepted but it's going to be going to be able to Pilot Elite OK and enter into Ariana's typically considered a favor Dustin threat match at that we have not seen great things out of town just yet this season was a highly prized Midland people thought he was arguably an upgrade over power people whom he replaced with TVs have a great year proud of having a horrible one I want to see that guy Step Up skills you can see if something out of their mid laner I can hope it gets funnier if you look at these team competitions the action should be from dlg all of the box. because you are never killing set painting for a Scirocco Lane so we got a pretty clear path I think you're so everything in this game or it happened towards the bottom triangle the map by the way up. Recognize that as well playing from their side and Spence can can also look to counter at least it's very well if you get there first you had a brush with which to start out for fighting back into the first game of a day what are they going to bring up cuz we have seen straka top couple times now my read us the rocket is that she's not incredibly team come for life right where you have carries the bottlemen already damage output tends to be at most, anyway rocket is generically just because every Champion has hell and you can heal every chance we have not made a champion that doesn't have health yet yet yet who knows you mean sometimes gets around that once but but but yeah it is purple and sometimes that can like just in general she's worth taking it almost everything composition and so you might be like the one that you are they trying to like make with the cycles of matter like she's as good as gold Champion I do like it when you have a good at least little bit of CC to work with to structure the team fights I feel like you really shines there why you can't with any team proposition it's very nice when it's rocket gets easy access and can stay right by the Carrie keep them up the entire time and a little bit of CC does structure your team fight for you but I completely agree with you definitely add a power level right now that's worth drafting in those are right and if you look at the inventory is done with the classic 3 Rejuvenation beads for the full to stay in and not to be able to whittle down this set at all that plus the passive plus the strong base stats for the Champions Kumo can actually take this harassment just focus on farming CS so basically top Wayne for me is literally just poking focusing on last test and Wave Control out here in the passive Yorkie that you can't multiply the past Health regenerate his own flat tire that stacked on top not that it's wrong to buy reduced because I feel basically five of Sword Lehigh exam going to ask for a second so you know just Invincible here and we'll take some autos and I'm kind of really feel good and that's the thing the lower that you get then your second part of your past and says kick in harder on your regenerate that much quicker but like we said focusing on the rest of the map because that's where the jugglers are going to play as expected Wiggly did start Red Seas going with a bottom ruin turn left I don't think I don't think it's going to be any big he farted on command prompt you knew he was top River did just do and usually after the enemy jungler shows like that and weekly is on your mini-map he was crowned actually hoping to the wrong side of the map guys want a hug besides your jugular is on away from the enemy but it's been scaring guests in there for an early killed in that Midland and that is going to go a long way at least now we're some early money is if you can actually affect bottom side of the map as well, bumps on Jarvis is showing eat ground could be Hobart okay so here here's a possible inside what crime was thinking there he was trying to force the Jarvan that is erroneous because they just stopped the Elise on topside like you were saying so he should be respecting the possibility has been scanned in there but that's what I would guess I would be his thinking there by positioning Puffs to the topside you want to force the zoo gay into Wiggly and it completely backfired yeah giving them a first-blood no flashes Lonoke described you as soon as I showed up o I have made an error and he is dead so he does at least hold onto his Summoner to look to find out what cancel is might be on soon as he's done on Craig's and then take the work there should be seen by spend spend those trigger words stealth very slowly so we saw him down he's waiting thin case me to Facebook this look I'm not distress you don't know I'm here and if you happen in going to wait around little bit we'll see if you come down later on push back up okay I'm not going to add you like she'll just focus on putting the wart in bottom died because when scaring they know just clear topside they just going to be the next area that he enters so they're trying to keep grass and keep tabs on the Elise from here on out instantly we saw a mid working down from zukie about 30 seconds ago that was in the top Lane brush because Darvin was mostly clear and bottom of his camp here does not have obvious tools to get away the press the movement speed by living space there and got them not any noctis to be had something walks away from Camp select going to be fairly difficult to affect the Top Lane and I think that time spent up in the top triangle in this game is fairly waste of time it's going to actually give you a genius this opportunity Dragon does the show Jarvan top side and yeah. Just walk your way out and playing for a well-written defending MVP MVP over on cloud nine get to take a break ECU for drivers go topside you have taken all of can't get to grab the slowest of the brakes and Mountain their bottle and dressed already great weird to know Ben is awesome and and there would have to do with it as well all right after dragon has been taken from the rip it's actually changes all the Dynamics for posting 6 minutes here before you start thinking about pushing out there waves are recalled off and do a lane swap to look at the Ridge Trail nextbigfuture objected so he would be nice to feel very good about picking up that dragon uncontested and as you can see you keep referring to this bottom Lane and the pushing that's going on from bang and Zanesville they retain control this minion wave this it looks like a 6in smoothie want to let them do that though and I got to cook pasta for this one will figure out what's going on with that one before too terribly long what are the meantime we got a decent start for Evil Genius year of course right and have got Baxter gank off the wrap look good a couple hundred gold off of this one actually is going pretty well for 6 a stye audience with your learning to onto pretty nicely which is so impressive stuff for them so you fellows can always try to take over and Crown you know just like that one ganking the you can talk assist you can call it trying to aggressively force a game yeah he was in what he used to teleport to get back to Midland so that's the reason why he didn't drop any CS despite dying it does bring up the conundrum of a Teleport difference in Midland now because you get done still have his for orianna orianna teleporting to another side of map is fairly low impact especially early stages of the game to expect it'll just be another teleport back the lane for him but doesn't mean that he should be able to keep up as well. On your screen the guy to get the action already early in this game with his Elise straight down the river honestly didn't take too much finagling for him to do that as we are talking about kind of the positioning there from Crown definitely gave him that opportunity and an EG very happy to get it but by no means is it going to cause a huge shift in this game yeah it's going to be it's going to eat you working for it they are head right now hope you don't moderate use really does matter it helps the set the Invincible cuz it'll just multiply all this after he has and he tends to build for Alley Brewery in the first place and small gold leave it on Spence Karen that means he's going to snowball his his early human game against are the matches going to get some more pills but I can reach you should be looking at where are their efforts going to be best placed to actually get them a better chance to win the game we've seen toppling gank from CLG even if you do get okay probably best Nair as you bring the set flash so you get a flash advantage in the Top Lane that probably doesn't move your needle towards a 18 victory for Soraka having flash advantage over a set in the top way very much at all that's why I really was hoping for some early at
look for that want to see some spice pics will see if we're going to get that Mortals Academy I got the cash but one of their games last night and they probably an absolute Banger of a cough we had putted Nocturne top so I don't know if we're going to reach that level of crazy here as the team's themed much more towards end of the standard meta pics but there is answering to get some surprise big sister is also can I use the academy Squad as a way of testing kits for letting you know they have them play and practice of these bags and sneak in what are the strengths and weaknesses of them and that actually be transition to LPS yeah I'm through here before the band though mostly as a top men's let's can go to Botley with level or High pretty much been down there as well.one that I wasting most Morton and Nathan been in the Outfield are the LED so that's been off the table that is a bit of a surprise doing that is going to be the last been here for dla but it is actually left up so it would not be surprised he headed to use this immediately snacks out unless they're really not comfortable so I can rent around is just such a powerful thick at the pro level when you are really playing this at a high-level it is sometimes feeling pretty Unstoppable and afelio so so there really a traitor powerpyx spla does give over the most heartfelt Bakery Campion but they do graphs that they forgot what I was going to grab them a lot of really power yeah one of them is the Keanu who though she's been banned the lot in North America what if you're actually quite some timeweird we can talk a bit about ourselves it's one of those things where I think often times people leave it up against players they're not thinking you're comfortable playing right cuz Keanu is a champion where you have to really be a master I think of that you can you play it well if your pH level for the farming I can't it's not good at also know when you're playing it from the jungle is mostly where has he professional place and do it but you know she is like 15% tax to beat level 144 jungle clearance so that's part of why she's dropped off the table here as well as a flex a collie and a set which is only a top laners yeah. Stephen Flex Fitbit if I actually go to call you back if I could see it right you just survive forever and then dumped her out of the crowd and like there's a kill their add to the case of this kind of Victories have got to seen very much of it but then againI just think highly of someone has never really good to be able to walk her down and actually kill her off you could withstand them that and they looked up before me the out but there are also some juggling a lot of set in a garlic ice cream play it obviously it's something that could come out we haven't seen it yet in North America as a jungle pick but it has a strong jumbo clear you can be this kind of Frontline cranky guy that feels that sing Rollie study of legible than experience the volume like runs trying to fast but it's like it's Worth Texas tonight if you speed up itself actually makes your gang a lot more effective than you would think. And when you have their feelings by + canvas cloak easier to accessas a jungler benefits of the top winner but that is no longer important leasing getting locked in that for sure it is a truth it's not about least been has the for fuel on the go for their top players for the fact that I strongly believe the pics in the stat should be picked that you are getting more of the Farmland in and you're not really in a Philly future acting a lot more to Kaiser people let that makes tfue exactly what I prefer to think a lot more when you already have our to get on the bus side I play a farm with GP looked going to stall that out but they are going for the more Kaiser so we're going to have to pee andbut actually match up well and bra with set that you know almost always you're going to be winning a ring for you if there's a lot of guys are all you're getting a lot of stats and when you are using that against a champion like set but I do think it's actually I mean I could buy them or type II feel like a win all those heads of Scrappy melee matchup I'm not sure how to fix stylist on his way back in the bed last time cast of Academy we had them on sale on that pic and the champion and he was really the reason they won the game it was just because they were stacked lipid Academy over their way back into this be a reason to this season I guess I could say is they're looking at zero in 3 but I think his way back and I think he's actually pretty good takeover off can't really know he's not just very wellchampion and back to to last year than as I went to call Lee and then filed for so popular has a pretty good alternative fuel there for the one the one I taken with your collie alt mordekaiser ultimate fall through a pretty good one I do also enjoy doing it on to those are the main ones that he is going to be looking for a fairly good matchup I would say there for you to eat your pasta Auto that way we can reveal the apollyon deal damage it if you're cute as a week and there are some options are they do have to go to combat that alright we are on the road and liquid Academy doing battle lost the Cloud 9 today but they can go 3-1 here in a cabinet liquidhow to tune to end of their week as well right now pretty standard spread of players looking to figure out who's going through yeah well I got to pay your mortgage is going to be any real loved one moves at this point take my time he was coach Kelsey mahanati is Kelsey you haven't caught up with you in quite a while you have some you play as the old kind of going through some changes has anything going and having a lot of fun and the working out things trying to challenge ourselves a little bit every day so close to legally take me to hear what is something you expected or was that kind of a gift for first pick they probably have a strategy into it I can kind of see how the strategy might go so it's just down to who I think is better she was really prize Concentra as well but it seems calling now and what's more Pantheon in the light from him it's even kind of opening up his champion pool as well yeah I think his waiting for new lease on the way there so we just kind of look for more flexible things making him kind of challenge himself a little bit more but I met you guys around the map doing more things along those lines and I think he's been taking really well to it back to the base of the call thank you very much basic time of fight in the bottom side to pay $3 back and forth get again waiting for you on this way isn't actually is a lot of these teams will spend a couple hours with a graph represents the coaches well. Okay we got to plan for the day when I was going to go it would have broken his left off throw like a 20 or graph out the window you like well I guess I don't matter because we're playing the champion with a call you in one of the really funny things that can come sometimes happen is when something is on Burn Ban a lot of prose will talk to will just say no no I just don't even say that anymore because they never expect actually get it so they'll go to stop practicing it they stop practicing against it because they never think they're going to have to play it on stage so becomes a waste of her time and never gets left out sometimes that can work out your contract for his birth of plastic play out in First Blood come through for contract that really nice typing from contract year does a full body side clear into that game before recall and is coming over the wall and being able to punish the trash around 2 in the Box I dislike the second knockout repeat gang you just runs right back around same Route One More Time both of violators Dead 3 and 1/2 minutes in here for TL Academy under these off to a great start to hold my hand ganks and good luck to you Ally on this one this is already after a really rough start this year for my gun go is he's going to take away the topside jungle so here is initial play as it's just a bro Freight over the wall a great that have passing in and I like titties go straight for the Gratiot trying to take that said more to Target of the evelio to we would have been tougher to do and then the tunnels already there it hasn't been killed off hacks with this faucet Circle does it right again cuz you said not respecting the damn cat flap available that full-time and just a pretty big Miss play from him to not actually flash out of there and surprise guests leave for Philly go to 31224 is the way to clear it out 25 I guess but that's the full weight Advantage takes a recall going to come back in the lane with a longsword the post-awards and all that set up fax it off good job coach Kelsey controller spot on the four members of first recall be there to see this until a few that is pure coaching get us out of the board so shut up for that it's always going to be a good thing to see in the steps to is actually seeing them plates and good spots right after you can grade them on that later on freak but I will like you going to be up and experience because he did get the takeaway you that blue side of the pond if she is naive Bayes do just enough power for me here on the league and he is sneaking into this brush to see if they can punish bake out a little bit but could be tough to actually knock him down more to the east on the lease in Fallout could be there is a duck for not slowed good sides to buy fake get to the fields lives but that's worth it. Splashdown yeah it doesn't depend that flash because he got a little bit too close that facebreaker came in Clapton together on that allows make him to get in there for the then just starting up the Dragon Ball in priority so happy lights hundred thieves are already out to a 1000 + gold lead and be adding the dragon to that and give me feeling really good about how these early minutes are going to go badly kept Jacobs ear that's that really fix that was kind of afraid to get away probably pick up a set but it went through top play the gate came through enforcement a flash so we might still be peeking for too long for the cake into maybe a kill but fun for them at Bay Area under the sea by the two pills the Breakthrough as well contract now has run away the flat style fine but everything and that is on the board he does find me everything free and they're going to take down trying to act like you're getting me killed there is going to be doing really good about that flash was down for contracts of the punished was available I can get to hold onto his flash at it just as divorce owners use black seed grass that kills them like a real V6 with black available here pretty shortly in may have an opportunity to look for one more kill tell my wife to come through the top side is Jenkins but cannot find more damage in a whole lot but still cleared out next to me keeping that pressure up trying to enable contracts to get these double to fight for vision am I can spot it out by the store but did not know it was the Brady they have to push so greedy is up here and it was a defensive control where there is going to force my camera back off a little bit that's going to leave a little bit of time to try to delay Mike young make him have that blue buff reset wasting some of the time they're for Mike he'll have to go to the topside and won't be able to hand over that blue bus to usually just yet and he's he's he's very low on man at this point does a very trying for a little bit then but that's not going to do too much and this is one of the difficult part about playing Amanda bass Champion into an energy-based Champion such as a collie as it extends further and further because more inequalities favor because she is you know that resource was truly but essentially right never going to run out of energy comes back so quickly Wellington timer 20 seconds to pull all the way up until cable turned out to get you always be able to feed both horses every single way. Same here for you to lie on the styles for now if I put the top side NFL teams make it to play try to get there early on the game and put their planes over the fight comes in 19 to hook them to the silly go not going to tell you just yet but a hundred things to listen to go forward on the top of the ones you spell that way no one's getting out of this one is banking than make out of by sometime I can handle all the cow is going to go down 140 now Jenkins that's why I'm running away gets reveal their just kicked out of the all by Mike Yung so really well played by him think I'm not able to take down things but they do Fords have flashed on the back of that play and down Summers from
all right should be a good one golden Guardian coming off their first win of the split and taking down EG yesterday I did like the idea of the historical but I think that could really intelligent not to possess the generals game plan but also has leaked into the donut who wants the group so Hadley and I think that you know that was a really intelligent answer to Camden I was there for me one with you and pick Dan which is really what your goal should be every time right you should try to see what your plan is to try to craft what their game plan is going to be in trying to pick that apart know where the seventies that is going to more effectively work for youwell that's going to work for immortals are going to Hope Has looked pretty good so far as a champion and the LSD at the robot voice really Bush when they lose to go equal amounts kill the champion but that's the way you want to go in late is that have to engage in scrap of them off and Lucy is incredible. They test you for taking more than he does from a silly farming about you brought fighting but we both have used gas and I'm more happy about that than you are right you're going to help scaling still I was like to see something like that from Golden Guardians we saw a lot of actually really good 5-year play monsteryour kind was able to carry Thomas game with that though I think that could be a viable pick I also do you think Ciara and win that lane against that early Lane can be difficult but getting into later stages really hard for a debt due to how easy to stack you parry the hitmaker which is where a lot of the damage is coming from set to reduce the tax rate on the Perry also very valuable and all the HP docking well you have a tremendous amount of Truth in his house before you damage on Fiora that can really cut through that so happy birthday themes in this game earlier so far this split but it's on my seats that so far todayback teeth by Sam heughan press button team Fighters are the BCS and so yeah I really do agree I think that's mostly where that wants to be right now getting some people died in the front line charging up your sugar passive Celiac UW Haymaker out. I think it would be interesting in a long size that anytime you are paired with Millie champion of the past have worked out pretty well but don't think we're going to see it so it will be the syndrome it and we're just waiting for that last big jungle recti popping up to be as a pretty obvious one and that's going to be it for a Smithy people just like this matter in the least in so much and it got to be too comfortable back by player once it has syndromethen they're not a threat of being fully AV though I think pretty nice setup does not pick their top laner before the jugular here they say no set up on the top land is like really know at the cake and otherwise I don't think so actually pretty well in lane and Global healing on global healing FBI my only question is do they have the actual damage output to kill any Frontline Immortals my real concern with its composition iscan you ignore the bed and be successful in that to you by right because with long antennae aren't the highest damage Ambien and it's hard to have a very early in her favour go quite a bit of bushes it's our fault I was at Q they can fit them out for the regen the problem becomes Champion like that very quickly if you take defensive ruins if you take note of regeneration ruins in it was all that you start with a D fields and you have all your passive brezza Lane to 13 Frozen on you because you can't actually sort them off the way you can actually fully push it in what you were looking for Mosey on the rocket is the types of frost a play you have a lot of global help in the form of Dennis Shield fundus Rock ultimate the most effective built Ivan thing and see if you rush into Redemption and that is going to make it very easy to have a super powerful offCynthia feels like golden golden Guardians because no one else besides laying here Soraka in the Middle lake am I like you know it's not the best at the controls at that said I've seen a tennis racket top in prose so you know we'll see what happens if he comes a thought like I'm under play Datsik will teach you to swing by so much it doesn't matter what you do you just walk over everybody so I want to see what's been doing this one going to be exciting game here and our fourth LCS game of the day is on Mortals and golden Guardians 2 battle on summoner's Rift got the visayan free over the third time in a row here on the blue side and a suraka top we're all excited to see for Golden Guardians how many years do you get for Soraka top interactive Kathleen Champion that every top winter hates the play against all right better or worse than spell cease billionprobably about the same really really trying to do much I want to throw back to the worst All Stars event ever wear it was aphromoo vs fragen Autotech only silly monster no Mastery firaga Dragon actually completely outsmarted everyone in that won't be one big ass like he convinced after me to do that and then he convinced take her to do a Nivea won't be one with just birth through have to look at the brand is better bring the hands those hands are good to empowering up empowering up all right but also PTA onset that's a first for me I haven't actually seen that you mostly Jesse conqueror grasp is actually the highest win rate as far as solo queue goes I'm going to have to grab be fairly effective I can not they have everything PTA generally speaking when you are comparing PTA vs. kankuro for stop playing at BJ's is it is very effective as far as Converse in your early game being able to get powerful trade the what I'm looking for is something along the lines of you know hitting you hitting Soraka with the polling or in and then trying to get a really quick trade their to process GTA where you didn't follow up with the handicap trade not too bad I'm not going to be slow and nice to you at all to hear as well yeah pretty close to the pool there as it does have some of that extra range in the exhaust coming out very effective starting absorbing a lot of the damage on both sides is going to work a little bit in Immortals favor as both 80s did use the potion in the Immortals look to try to get a little bit of deep dish near as they do have the bush with the skill order will be for Hunter you know what is going to be humax but there is some differing on how people actually fill this out when they take over 20 W do you actually fully maxed Acuvue Goku and then about 20 feet before you go to w oriole look in the group earlier so that'll kind of tell you how he wants to play the game if he starts back CW early he is looking group if he stays warm purecure he's hoping that he can find me to to be affected in the inside Lane the ones you want to install OS for a while on Castroville when you're alone doesn't do a single thing so going to wait at least two level at all as you mentioned not knock the first no reason to do so yeah yeah it's it's just more do you put more points into you before you go and get that board or not cuz you're always going to go pointing to queue yep that is your way out to your poke it is what is going to keep you healthy throughout these races should I attempt in the bottom side closure is around but they going to cut right back there. We'll go back to his team and just be able to opt out of there so no real issue for him but it doesn't mean that seller is going to go over to admit he is spotted on that you 50 times the camps for a brief but closed going to grab his Grouch without medication if you want to know. Just make sure they passports wrong and the fairly early game in this one it is a very valuable can't take down gold for XP bo4 time I am at Camp Creek pause it was Keith you submitted the command will see what is for a little bit yeah so just a little bit more it is going to be second wind taken by so as though you know that that becomes very very effective against Champions that are so poke Reliant likes rock needs to go down to really threaten any sort of a killer or even laid pressure because you have the door on Shield regen you have second wind region and the passive on that where you're getting additional region every 5% of missing help you have a becomes really a lot for Soraka but so far in the hospital has been controlling that lane fairly well he's been trying to basically hold the wave outside of his turret without letting and crafts which is both a safe spot for him and also you know it dangerous to offer to us not going to be something to watch for certainly as though we wait to hear us out they have not yet heard what the condition is for this one but as we wait to get into the game over August 8th of course very very close gold nickel and a guy still want to redirect to go to glue being a primary can win condition here because you know I'm not expecting this The Rock aside later not switching to the Senate Side Lane and this is the second time is it back to concerts for your game we are golden guys okay we have a very sure we're going to play around one person on the other side in the four of us together and last time around it was it was stingy with the group and all that stuff this is a different one for its gold and it's it's a trend coming through for go to Karns where they're at they're playing very obvious would have one for play Styles actually have LeBlanc game in the first game of the season against these were they had a significant Advantage they felt like they should have been with clothes that came out but they weren't quite able to do it and you know he was performing very well in that but they just couldn't actually close out the game and you know sometimes with LeBlanc you can get the cycling event has what is a very often more about pushing the side lane and then finding a pic you know being able to actually control Vision in and catching people in rotation people going between lanes where you can then pick them off because LeBlanc it's rare that you see the games where the blockages winning through you taking all your towers for a trifle but it's more just about the pressure and then creating vision and no areas where you're going to have a dark spot on the map where he can pair up with closer and try to take people out here as we about three and a half minutes from this point on is what I'm getting for when we're back into the game so not too long ago but he was a good commercial break I understand we'll see you back for the game starts back up but otherwise it's been a closed-top play match up right before and sees over there Midland very very tight there of course as well and on the other side of course we can just line up it's it's been a pretty Center front-to-back stuff as we kind of expected I think the primary engage Duties are going to be mostly Jaco here and work on he is used the most rely cable and gauge we've talked about the fact that set enough to walk at you could walk the front of the art of them but only to get rained it's all pretty short rain is there in and of itself rek'sai flash engages usually not that strong can you be a champion you do Warrior Cleaver and if you're flashing for inform your team you're going on for one that's not ideal either so got to be very watchful of what I can do when he gets out of line for throne season 20 20 or support to spend more than they are opening gold on support items feel like early Bogey's comes through a lot of the time I know I was worth something to do is recalling movies with lock Top Lane and no one ever remembers that supports Monroe yeah I mean I've seen it remember playing a like 5e fight like full pre-made normal game with with Glebe and use total support he's like yeah she told me to buy land on 43 Conestoga Lane top basically it's like pillow the top later I was like one of the few minutes because that you're not feeling good job I worked out we're getting the letter r in chat so ready to go back in this one The Spectator 3 has unpause the game think you could a spectator 3 Let's play League of Legends or waffle play it second one yeah you know you're right let's you just want to get out of here if you up yeah so we will see you know when you when you're comparing gauge options though they were fun as someone who is reserved be very reliable right and you look over on the other side for Golden Guardian they don't really have a super reliable way to engage know you have to rely more on getting a pic with LeBlanc no coming over Crush for some Sofa King flashlight play it with leasing but it's so difficult actually pull off when you are trying to go forward into your posing do you know if you actually just die then you take a cue it can be very Telegraph or on text message prank calls and you starve yourself as you're going forward eventually yeah yeah this is one of the things that we've seen a lot of teams draft me to call me if you like golden Guardian app and they can be successful in the plane for the position of power and the way you essentially for Spicewood TX is 5 going to an objective and forcing her going to come find you in Enfield he feels that they are but yes it gets one of them as they are just for them to get back but it's going to be a pretty hard green or I'll take has TT but I still be damaging the threat can be more time for the counter jungling up on the pasta if he's actually taking the frogs away right now in time to actually stop that way from fully crashing and Smithy is going to be behind author of Silence
on TSM he comes to Cloud 9 to the greatest sound bite it'll be different if they're good or not quite winning or whatever is it is working but we are finally now it's can't black and focus on these two teams here under these could be going up against Cloud 9 and I'm really excited to see if we're going to have any more equipment pick up this far as picking been on any kind of interesting things coming out Garvin has been I think one of the big go to do for medial is very popular jungle throughout the league but there are some players who really highly prized this pic above the leaves in the fall of the gragas is no other world which I think it it kind ofHP Z2 play noise you're going into it, didn't like in stages it does have the Brewer game start making power but is that the playmaking 2 pencil I think all the jargon is much lower than that of aggregate or at least having that trade out there right absolutely must give it does come through with the final picks for second base with bands right now it's about 9 o clock in their final Champion then there's to leave him a really kind of cutting your bladder before at least sodium and a waste of his third least in game being in the leak Walter and I just like super early stats are always a little extra because like well yes two of the six twins are on their personality credible undefeated how could you not Bandits ribbon every time through pick a champion todayhas been great on late then a lot of fun I think to see him have you know clearly a starting position and there is not going to be this walking back and forth our or anything that we have seen or heard about the fibers going to get it jotted being a full-time starter for a bit but what if he can continue to perform well a lot of Martin being parted out now here in the band 459 they have already grabbed Dennis Devinney outlawed the priority one solution almost always on the band tables the first round will there be any outside of any Affiliates I would immediately think of something along the lines of Misfortune that is quite popular still in the middle of these days considered very good cleaner has a white cross as well but that being said you're then go to be having to pick and then Fortune into Nautilus Leaf Endive and that can be something that is very Troublesome for mmatorch and who doesn't have a dad in trouble to say State than this is kind of goes bad to worse when you have concealed in there there's so many Die buddies put into the DMS locked inwhat the players are playing a whole lot of I asked you wouldn't know if I would have kept my eye out from work on it as it comes out I want to have a wedding Lane. But now it's actually very support heavy line up your efforts Cloud 9 if not before then on Seneca and put out some dance what is generally a more supportive scampi and Morgana obviously the same as super good and he's very good in the leblancs matchup have to bury song interactive you have incredibly strong way up there with the w Max was almost always what he will go for in that bit Lane once you get a handful of levels you can really start have LeBlanc pushy and under the current it will block this door or answer that with the binding you have the Black Shield you actually immune the roof coming out from the chains there and you are going to be in a very powerful at supporting and protecting the senate or even the Camille who's going to be able to kind offorward it to be very vulnerable to Champions like Leona but when you have this Morgana with the super powerful blackfield amped Up by all the AP later in the game well it becomes very difficult actually break that for a Leona then you're becoming dependent upon who will want getting back there too and that could be really tough another game or are you being a little a very frequently you'll see a blue side draft you just go jungle baat Lane in 1 2 3 and then traded kind of extra counter Pitkin and you go there a power PICC wise you have to assume you just look so pretty tonight I really like the draft for C9 that being said I do think it is low on consistent damage if you have a poorly game you can sometimesrun over with the type of compositions we're all of a sudden you're just not actually putting out enough damage to birth people down things like a truck and Leona and as well as Darvin flying for it can be very problematic for you know this and it's actually really kind of work your way through ya also worth noting that is going to be a dark Harvest almost exclusively glacial augment that is mostly about know that kind of stacking up of the souls in Auto into a cue for that to hit combo dark dark Harvest is hired damage of course but you do have to trade aggressively to really get a lot out of it because a low stack dark harvest in actually adding must damage later on in the game so we'll see if they are going to be training more aggressively playing more aggressively as a result of the number to try to really get a lot out of itI know last time we saw the dark Harvest it had I think to harvest acts like 25 ish minutes which means the Keystone as usual it'll be twice not the most strong but you know you mentioned the TV. Harvest can help just a little bit in in getting to that difficulty exactly a double sweeper start so they actually use this key sweeper just to have that sidelined Ward's then they sweep all the way in here provoking and they know this has not been spotted it may be sucked out simply because of where that First Weber was used but pretty much things they do spot Vulcan has been coming back the lane so they are going to exactly what's going on now just based on the direction of they actually came through media will run straight to the red buff N Out of these did get to shove in that bot Lane so it is going to be some CS lamp after a fight right here in this confined a binding maybe it's a slow walks away chords Keep mine glacial more dogs than the Autotext Logan set up also has not seen going into this Red Sox he jumped over the wall to eatWard's get the bypass all in the Bible tells about his gun was hoping it was going to be a little bit slower had me is gone say Ludacris to read you would have actually gotten there in time to to stop that and get that free bus start but because meteos knew what was going on Branch Shreveport he is able to grab the owners Red Bluff and stay even as far as those go the little park right there again this you just pushing up a little bit and finding some room for her ass drop his first yeah good bit of damage did the W cooldown is is going to be read that for every tick on cannons as well as Champion so you're saying that he's trying to place that but it is always on the Canon if you're not going to be able to hit the blunt keep you cool down low and maintain the bush also worth mentioning that is glacial augment on the Morgana to this is going to be the Super Soaker spooky ghost type set up that is going to help with their engage I'll be able to scout out opponents be able to slow them down for pencil Nautilus or lease in engage or even for that follow up from Zen for now slightly defenses go and get the black shield on three of the probably correct match going to fight you in a dark enough to knock you down the first, get rid of wax seal so he should be depressed if there we go back though and if he was afraid that's where a lot of the damage is and that's also where that route is going to come through. So be able to me in that pretty big deal it also has felt like so much of this of the game really has been about switching lanes can you have a cat party in your lane be able to shove and allow your jungler to get access to think of Rick Dale to get things packed his things like that Dragon and Morgana is really going to excel in that regard and it's just not much that LeBlanc can actually do to come out waveclear Morgana right now we go and look at games they once again lead to Cloud 9 size of that is pushing waves have not yet been a difference up in the top link Without End there in about looking pretty solid here so you got to stay good starting to Cloud 9 as this way to switch them down here has been in book and Doin just fine I'm waiting I'm waiting for for Cody and and yeah it was a nice start though from the Hundred Years by line as far as they actually kind of got that really recall off they pushed in their bonus. At least I went back to base double Doran already purchased up here for Cody Sun directly stacking really effective on a map it is one of the Champions that I talked about no can be somewhat vulnerable to all in this is something that helps alleviate that not only through the effectiveness of all the lights the only way you're getting a lot of flat HP that can help you survive against early all ins when you are going to 34 Dorrance played as a lot of Emmett layers like to go all that far in this game but yes can I have a lot of found this one receipt for Vitiligo funny damage from Midland going but do you recall break out the arrest of corrupting potion the door and rang and the extra fairy Toppers Amanda game yeah I just five minutes in the dragon of the life and you might see that attempt for the very early Phil about drink for the lady face if they are fighting video of horse flies bite their first football game will be there first to right now that that is going to the key there that they would have that extra man and he was still pretty close but yeah I'm just relating we should be people kind of gorilas you feed and then just tell that off later on. It's going to be the same idea here really don't see the one for me to go over the reports. Not going to make it happen but videos on that control working to make it not happen here and now that's the bottom Tyler going to find a sun towards then tries to walk away but he's revealed he's not going to get the passport photo lab and persuaded claim that was supposed to turn to run fuel comes in Cuba and seconds are cameras picked up their damn is working out really well played by disengage the send another hook comes in and I was going to be a route on a Cody Sun the follow-through maybe is there is something going to run a little helper full can I get some shots as well no follow-through available now if they go low Health part sew a very low healthbars them but you and ignite so both were able to refund off eyes then which is really important in the early all in where can I can make up a large spinach without damage you have to be very careful because she's dagger those abilities so you know he cleanses the sun would know them immediately after then get the most out of the family right well it's all about and Drake does come through for bladder has one more time they got the pass through to you a little bit of a junktown on his van B is on the side and he goes down if you both signed off as I pointed out and been able to just walk it out that cleanse really paying dividend the great roof Doug connect onto videos and blabber with easy follow-up is was not able to get into the next to try to take that you for his jungler though First Blood they're over to Cloud 9 and now it's that is silly yeah I mean, I think it's a level 1 Black Shield at this point that's a nice piece to inexperience on the champion if you think a level one blackfield is going to be able to prevent infirmity erupting that combo right like that is easily going to break your black heels and then the game will just go through but it's not going to really mean to too much but it is Hunter Tuesday Kansas pastor's wife year do you like him that good wave foot for them happen they are on this Rift Herald Labyrinth around do does have fight does have the opening the door for Medias picking up that's what I can fly with a safety but now the re-engagement coming across licorice 1/2 from McCalla over the stock is gone and you're comes to re-engage the kicks last text to Karen and some days either. Donde yeah they get 2 kills there for the rift Herald good a job 500 East directions to cure that to make sure that wasn't able to steal this away but still pretty costly little Adventure there for them as they are going to lose that not till 6 the flag and videos which I believe Reds like it's the rest of the damage fix it up one of the boyfriend of Thieves trade back pretty big they do still lose that blue buff I believe but there are at least able to get a kill back for themselves and we'll see how much can they get with this riff because that is a pretty big investment you lost multiple lives going for it and you lost out of control of mid lane and you are pretty far down is gold at your hundred he's right now but I really had to work out what kind of hang on in this game flapper goes in with the Q Plus Mike let's see where it goes down to volume just a little bit earlier Barbara wasn't able to get his off so Grace might they're from videos but then over talk to give him to Stacy to actually do stuff and then it's a great kid flash sectioning off the odd man out if somebody was off to the side in the way from the team to a couple kills do go see nice way and they're up pretty significant amount of gold here at 10 alrighty 1800 gold and about Drake which is I would argue that it is better than infernal in almost any comps as one of them so if you're what's a nautilus in front of you don't care about getting 680 in like one of those about 80 armor and fortitude
Stacy LG did Lewis or the opening set up so we'll see if this goes through as well as pics of bands have begun mordekaiser is dropped off a table course we'll see what they could do from the south Phoenix so far has not played a mage in the bottle by Dove Academy Misfortune was his debut game to just find a mate had like a 26 KDA on Zoe SO waiting again to Kumo Thorn that's fair Celtics Beltone cash off the table Rumble and a collie dropped off here Tuesday spent a long long long time on CLG what are the essential and Tuesday was on it he's back here in the line appear as well over BBQ Oliver's indologist Korea it was like he was dead the whole time through either way is that they're ready to go open Bandit. Going through who is CLG don't mind that one week we did a ski covers in our first game we really so sorry and I was like oh my goodness drive to your loved one out of Belio snot band better not band Phoenix X MF is he go to volunteer I mean and also both of these teams did play mat for the game so can't completely disagree with it so far and that's definitely going to be one of those very strong many faces and I mean if it's not broke don't fix it and if trash work for them and game one they're doing it again here all right now it's back to see Oggi's this time around do this to you Vikram South got time to take down already has the least room self because that's what it's okay we'll grab a sport and I want to rush 2 aphelions betta I mean to be bad for the second fan face are you afraid of that do you want that to be you know that I can see if I can get down to tear I think they should do a fellow here but there is a champion pool things you'd be trying to consider you also always have to wonder what A team's goals are in a cat bite okay number one language game I mean I think Raven stood out late and asked if you could play forward as it looks like it's bblg getting away to the 202 after both teams just hard walking in there bot Lane jungle making us do the next day it's going to be completely dedicated to Solon band and I kind of get back to the what are you doing in Academy question cuz ultimately everyone's goal is to make else yet so like teams and players need to figure out the best way to do so is it by showing that you can be laying Domino's Draven or is it let me master all of these Metal Champion so if I get. I don't know right like it's going to depend on each player from this draft it looks like both you guys are staying with the NSA candreva tick with a cellular Center just being absent this is not an LCS game like we're not practicing that apartment that would never happen in LCS so I thought answering I actually wish we were seeing Santa Fe Leo's here but I like the Viper School of software it's like a what I can do three or four games that split and play aatrox in order to fresas chicken for a player on 3/4 blood Raven game to split the rest and then after I pick you up at 4:20 from Korea right does taking Imports lot you know that back if you can spray tan players got to got to feed heads and shoulders above you know what domestic fired because of the go down the water and put it like this is what I'll spell it for me to Monte Forest had that great so we came back on Friday and a Truck Yeah so that is now 3/5 of their day 1 composition lourlo Phoenix and oil are playing the same Champions it is impossible for them to Elite was taken away from that the Cadian played and the Zoe has been banned which is what the month W or to be honest to get away from the ball back over all very very good cleaner overall and with Concord not doing true damage you can generally Atlantic at that pretty well I was taken Tuesday around 2 BC or meet again seems unlikely but you never know I think or mid is actually pretty good I think you can wash a lot of Lady phases and and kind of go from there with potential Rome's in the same way that a nautilus regalio can be a good mid laner but it does not require a lot of things. To go running after the remaster that came in beginning of the year and don't get me wrong but he's actually very very strong Chaffetz do waist nearest weaker that doesn't mean he's over off but it's damn it is very high racer has a really high and he can actually blow people up Vikings going to hire his early-game Thor abilities fight fight fight low borello 13 + it doesn't kick in he's actually quite take he just hates that wife if you don't get one shot you can get to W Hills off that healing is up as well like if if you were taking up with survivors have to fight you are an absolute pop off the road back for Damonte is to just kind of fruit without a shadow of a doubt like you I like the pic I want to see you show up with cool stuff like Tuesday is is very journeyman Academy player here for about three more years of point and end against it for your voice mate just dial on this game right now that she answered that affect at least once in awhile play her hattefjall again like 25 into overall game on her so yeah I like that as well being Popoff things like to have baby be single stack roster in the seats are my provider for winning Academy foot and I want I want to see people alright the stage Academy game at the end of Sunday try and get a little bit of showcase for these guys to make their arguments for going into the LCS augment Phoenix doesn't seem it seems like a graphical thing I could have sworn I saw press the attack just making sure a conqueror and not not electrocute so so that it that it a little bit it's getting fixed will update you when it's real or you'll be able to tell Lauren seems unlike what's the most XP of these I might be curious yes that's okay that's true that's it for me Vixen comet irelia would you were aboard wordox Raven at least, it does things right hurry and of you and are all kind of spells you know what okay and then I'm going to fix it all right it's just it's a point-and-click yep shock button except that it's worth it conquerors really hard to stack firewood carrier is going to Safeway in Syracuse he said there's the first time since Mike there is the kill first one is in that blue bus goes to as big as well that's really bad for an Olaf to get that kind of Edge on you and you to be down Flash Blue gone where does Acadian go from here probably just kind of full. So don't jump if you could really see what she took her boots I can sing well I want I want to hear because you know right to go Red Bluff to Candy try to steal blue like do you make the calls I like instant recall take blue invade Raptor like right how much do you know I don't think progress can ever try and get blue with the thought of me being pushed like this so this is this is Acadian saying you're only ever get free camps may be okay yeah but yeah l'acadiane should run through get his flu and then go to read but because you showed mid he's leaving his own red expose acting really don't like that I think I'm supposed to go to space probably fortunate one more time as we were meeting about Ruth indicate if it's just up above easyflash follow our respective leftovers. all right well I get it back his own chicken so he did go and select was on topside guarantee no more steals my last to follow me to pay for the pole Academy what it means to be Acadia to on the jungle on Tuesday not instant flash Following over to maybe get the last hit gives Demonte more time to get more refills off it is a good start for Kaden's office and I'm pretty sure every scream ever they would say Chicco next like I've already called the speed ride like this this feels so catastrophic it's rather catastrophic I was completely you watching the Columbia when I mean Tuesday she want me to fight in a big meeting wave has become a little dangerous but he is playing towards the jungle right has the flash away Tuesday doesn't know exactly where he's going to be able to flash and then he had too much he's just going to be able to cycle axes all the way down after is red was stolen by at least who's lot of pain right there little bit have to look in to see what that was about play Cecile GT Davidson Windville playing not sure where but either way they're there at least you know calling in call into the meeting check into the server online to the best I can for all employees of course as well but I'm going to find you no 26 Yankees player dumplings actually + 3c yesterday's hits this week has been jungle that's a really got to talk with you. Phil is the player who bought the game looks like he is to see what he's trying to fix his monitor for something so hopefully it's not too long of a delay before you get back this one just as you were talking like wow what a catastrophic or the game can dignitas speed run this one you do never know right depending on one thing going wrong or the Bounty being lost by the Olaf it would be the display the dignitas wants to make an academy when they signed such a Powerhouse Academy roster I enjoyed by the way I'm sorry. I couldn't do it because I love every game reading player chat all of Phil's cooldown tracks are in all chat that's so when I get invaded and 50 seconds alsat 540 jungle flashback for the jungle flash but then he says he's like ship entering outside anything I know you spell cooldown you want a cracker for me when I give you the exact second that's actually you think that's intentional or cuz there is a level of mind game where you spam there flash timers to them right like you know how it was June B's proview during world like he has the most spam E flat out player in the world like he will max out chat all the time if he just did that to all chat actually be an advantage the other team would have to disable all chat because he was scroll there there I thought we can you disable all chat in custom games you can there's been proved use where they touch their own team pics just happened that's amazing so yeah you can do it the other way everybody eventually they'll know like oh yeah yeah I want the misinformation I'll check that's that's that's like the thing I'm not know about that when I was going through right now is dignitas to the way around but I like to say hey but now this is the way it's backed up on the side of the lane if there's a VIN and it's going to lose water park Gemini really fun
have you watched you with but it is still early so that's the theory for c o g now I just have to get it working in fact if it comes through as they pick the bands have begun got themselves their first from yesterday in the lot of that was a man who's going right there by piranhas ribbon and we'll see if yes yeah the one I like that that's why we're here to see if he left leave on the field jersey that is what he said as a League of Legends team by Hotshot GGthe inspectors I'm sorry next week you'll be available Love Goes by bird the overall met a little bit of the word Susan what's amazing to me is like we really hard to call dribble a minute later. Way more often. Because of how the magic would Rumble mid is almost Unthinkable in the LCL because it's a very powerful think we saw a little bit of time in the LCL karthus jungle is nothing santorin plans with insole of you has brought out briefly knows he has to be very limited success this is the this is a peony flame it stick say right now how about you play 83 down there this morning cast the bands have stayed fairly static throughout the week and aside from the odd like ribbon released in speaking into the band Tiffany support and just grab the Italian Senator oh yes she can be strong as support if I leave I am laying with Senna plus melee is the male ego and you threw everyone and the Damage most traditional following carries are Rave so you could almost never get the effectiveness out of your stomach you right on top of that it's like you can do other things put make it even harder for a daycare center tickets tolls make the items Killingsworth like his other Matthew things you can do to correct but at its core the design of the Q and so we have Sunday to carry with a tank support who is melee it makes it really does lineup for the current situation that we're in how they interact with fans right now I'm the only one support what rank is two up when she won with justify the ways you might see that band come through as well you don't you see Morganna off of p o e I wonder if but I wonder if they if a Victor become to catch syphilis right it's one of these best else yet Champs and it's one of crowns best chance of all time. These played it that much weight has rebuffed Victor where he doesn't get full man off of a like and it came up here to document even stronger and already consented Orton comes through at the Top Lane band Robert history I mean obviously he last year filled into the back door behind all the others but the friend of mine games back and forth to recycle does the Earth gain from back when it was all about playthrough darshan top of the top and getting a new one stress Victoria tootell asking you babyface the rubble but I will see what is always take out okay but Leona is better for Ignacio oh man crop in North America what's a hover board game today in 2020 you called it this is actually a kind of pics that she was really early on doing they were doing this halfway through dumbest play last year in finding lot of success with it so very good at playing the backup I think it'll Jets matter whether or not they can get him going and if they can't deal with the rest of the team had to get engaged off just like the rumble pushing to Rome borderline city of cellulose to the owner of Rex ice tub that's a lot of dangerous stuff going Bottom Line that could full weekly down there if we can get a dick no more stops all appropriate stuff to yourself and time it's down the final, to the coaches why do fat people for the game he was linked to play about he was really depressed and just licking playing time for handshakes and off they go with you to pick someone up looking forward to seeing you play actually so something that I find interesting about these Beauties is a lot of the ways that they will win is true teamwork rather than thinking hey here's an individual who's really going to hypercare like when he's been good it was like 10 Turin working with a team like teamwork Dory going through and likewise you were maybe saying it's Wiggly maybe saying it's ruined but overall it was very much around teamwork do based on preseason power rankings I had CLG at 4th and flyquest at 7 but there's a lot of variation between that cuz I'm thinking like black spots on their best day quit just be better than CO2 right because you're worried about if things go well it could be very good for them which is why I mentioned in this matchup his innocence they kind of both win the same way and I fell asleep or full of brambles kids. Pineapples in the back I appreciate that we'll see if you we can get him out of the champion very highly prized midlander in Pro play don't get much of North America are going to get here today as we get to play Airsoft over yes that is indeed about to do on a Philly yesterday. Liotta again just thought they were in the wrong order it did when they join the lobby it's actually ignoring Turtles fault and you know the graphics can account for player error not that hard ulcs order if not that's why you get right almost every time. We're jumping at a chance like 4 I think the game okay well as the players get ready to go to the lanes without too much of a skirmish happening going to have Gabby sit by with song for an interview thank you so much free I do have song here you are new to the organization so I wanted to get a couple quick thoughts from you first of all, and also knew but some are thinking about the Synergy that you and he may have so what do you make of his addition to the steam yeah I never work for you to call me in the past year but when I talk to to be the crown we are related to respect each other and we have a life similar strategy or the gaming knowledgeable there so we are really love and have each other if I right now looks pretty good for a mission of smoothie so thoughts on the bot Lane Synergy that can come from this these kind of support and then both guys really cocinar thing we're right now and even last year I want you to walk me to somebody because I know that she's tired and I came out of those plans so I also really love somebody to thank you they were play I thought fit to be a good-looking lineup for the squad and I will see if I can pick up the first one here gets wiped out today because of the history of Steel G like the teams that have been around even pre LCS you mentioned the 10 years of see OG Bali were one of the original members of The League nearly got relegated that one time they've had their ups and downs a 1/2 LCS titles they have banners hanging right here regulate body style that was a very iffy re-engage bi-weekly I'll give you the first jet sure Crown tried to help play it but there's no way that flash Paulo is going to work into a full house rek'sai and Rumple no big over reach there to make it go from bad to worse so first off good cake from Santorum you're expecting him to go for Scuttle crab that's why Crown is trying to step up Scuttle crab spots it's not there but I think happened to come to your room and says I'm here and smooth it says I'm coming to River and wimpy doesn't walk if you get away that's what he was likely thinking doesn't make it right I don't get enough. 3 seconds off Squad was not there for the follow-up infant turn around and that is too quick killed 1400 going to be early game I'll lick their wounds I imagine he's got some Farm that's going to be a long road back up oh yeah I wasn't changed in the offseason so still very valuable to pay on the map and I want to see if Dan touring can really get to leave here with the double longsword Advantage he has over Wiggly any type of fight he can actually find a jungle he will be strongly advantage GameStop man just imagine the match up with your pitbull dogs when you're already paid for the only one like okay maybe invaded take you can't play right now though pint or just on the farm game trying to push around them to you we there for the closest farm near a well it's worth noting that of course he is Flash list and so Jarvis if you can get behind At All YouTube a cat can turn to a bill is going to require some respect that a few we can appoint out a water jumpers jungle off of peace I think she has a jungler who definitely does the mask so last year he was one of the first junglers to highly prioritized broke because back then cruggs gave about twice as much experience as other major jungle camps now relatively Rob is the best temp to take yes and I think Santa is not going to be someone who takes a long time to optimize that has passed you going to do it right away so you can actually see if he did his grub just have all the way across the map there's actual Ward on weekly area so he's fully bought into trying to get this is going to walk over work here in Texas if your juul be here today has sucked down to this part of map of the first we know why you can't order second ago his situation is known and sits around waiting. Do u e n Rumble is level stick deflector take pics in through Wards are sweepers they also get rid of this vision I really real say yep I've got a recall got to go from this one is Raptors or back up clear those a little bit no gang I'd be happy but you can easily just go for the Drake generally knowing that people are going to be on a reset and uses that double longsword an adage to get likewise that really ocean break all of this is based off of his early game gang but still a good start for a flag of all junglers in the game he's in he said he often outfitting stores support in his games as well early sweeper got rid of that Ward and kind of Portofino Forest about laying back off the recall bit of Aries the ocean right grab so he is arguably out farming and he's got the global objective here as well and as long as I also find it interesting when junkers play against their former mid-length which is what happened because the mid laners to swap to write like santorin should be fairly familiar with how Crown plays the mid lane and likewise with Wiggly in Pardeeville so I think that's part of why both those jungles were drawn towards the Midland and this is probably reading too much into it but I also wonder like paid attention or notice the crown can always push up around shuttlecraft for like what is that something that was your weakness or strength of his right there's something clever about skipping over Scuttle crab to go for that gang yes it happened 4 and 1/2 minutes ago but it's still the most important thing happened so far in this game
Gary what about sports the world are keep didn't look that bad on day one where a lot of people thought hey if one thing is going to put golden Guardians at the very bottom it's going to be the teeth experiment not working yep and as they already closed your did look very good but also I do think jungle extremely volatile update one in beating to yell in 24 minutes. The first they dropped a lot of the Ross pick up a lot of players back in the Honda and BP Frontera like those are big shoes to fill quite obviously as he said not literally fix use a big shoes to fill in sneaky and how well he does we will go and Guardiansis going to go with Anna filios for Stena if they're available they don't need to pick the Santa right away but they do have to pick it before the next phase of bands do really just bought them lanes in an early jungle locked in Rex I'd probably trying to block Weber's least in with his white slaver played in day one but still plenty of things available wouldn't be too surprised to see a jungle gear and it says we should be on our band out and he goes for his very on the 1st which is a rare start for the lease in to actually have a chance of going early TM out and being Amor Farm Focus Lee sin where is rito Village is still the more likelylet me see Warwick is the champion who starts rejuv be but if you get a strong enough pole and you're only planning on doing one of those Red Bluff to blue bus to Grand Prout you can totally swing not having a refill the first clearing is basically dead in this week I do feel like that is the case I mention on the analyst desk the jungle proximity stat which is the percentage of the early game 3 to 15 minutes for you within 1,500 units of an Allied last year that averaged about 40% yesterday was 51 so junkers or spending over half of your the game near a teemix so I can see why you reduce fever matters there because you're actually not farming nearly as much right to get to text me when you get bored Total Health that way than hell. Yesterday was going to come through otherwise have a mirror trolls and Bots Lanes togethergraphs the final solo is going to come through Gangplank band off Cloud Nine to pick and the Shoal encounter fix are going to be very important in this one generally speaking Misty got a lot of counter picks last year but Foster is also a top laner who often really likes counterfeits as well and it's not like licorice is a slouch in toppling he's arguably the best food we talked to still by locking in the Zoe it's one of the more flying pickable mid laners especially after we factored into LeBlanc and Ariana fans that were happening in the second phase do I like Cloud 9 strategy there or getting Zoe in and then waiting to see what liquors can kind of his with more or less as fast as Diana service Berkeley and aggressive in your face him for glue so Star season out against many people's actual favorite aggressive against the very best players in the role and he's going to try to make that happen for a squad as they need one final pick your top way to paint rocks kind of have to go with the Fairly blind pickle top laner and aatrox there's no apply for the other side with Jenna play Riven Camille is one of the counter picks we seen go so nothing is really completely safe popping out though is we just got gold and blue on camera being very vocal after the day and kind of thinking about the leadership structure on this team clearly a lot of hey I'm going to play Diana this way this is what I think will work for us yet and personally playing lot of dental work very well with melee divers on the team you're queuing the opponent's anyway it damages and heels in a line you may as well get a bunch of stuff to be in that line to heal so that's the simplest way of looking at it and golden Guardians is very all in but I don't hate voice to support those campus to come through on that one and maybe catch can pull it back out no expected role swap steer lease and go stay the same the top link has good game for the Leafs in bladder and then for him Diana is melee going to be in the range of leasing games as well as we might even be fresh for there but does have some good set up in the right situation but it just depends who can you manufacture that situation where you have a lot of mid jungle power between closure and goldenglue because they can win early to be to specially now to Diana guess the dash before level six right the Holes Dig kit change around pretty popular not only people liking the power of Diana but also more people playing also helps against the damage amps the farther she can move so in her face you don't get one shots and we are on her if everybody let's go as golden Guardians and Cloud 9. Rob's end table and definitely going into this game Cloud 9 coming as a really big favor a lot of analysts expected Cloud 9 liquid not because they're saying the Cloud 9 is definitely better than Team Liquid but because Team Liquid was playing with the substitute younger and shrimp are so even though it was a very mild Asterix next to it with a sub but if they can come out here and have a resounding Victory against golden Guardians that would be a fairly powerful week one statement definitely agree Golden Gardens play the hundred thieves closed yesterday it was kind of in the very end that it's altered but they've gotten the soul that gotten a lot right in the first one if I bet it's so I certainly a reasonably strong team and I am sure see how fat I stack up against the golden Guardian side of course has their toughest opponent of the week and if they hold up well especially if they win that's a great statement for them yeah and going back to Golden Guardians gave me a ton of Thieves they had an early game and a strategy that works very well they were actually on the red side of the map so they ended up invading actually this exact point but they're just the other team I want to see if he can do any type of jungle shut down onto blabber because that was what gave them a big Legend the other games and allowed them to get the dragon soul and he closed in that game and from the looks of it but he is just doing early red side for clear but we'll have to track that throughout the game Well of Souls drop at the Red Bluff not claim to your by FBI didn't have time to go over and grab that one but going to walk over to Lane all the same as if he pushes in early on a couple of Cs picked up your buy gold and blue as well and truly a fun map to watch Forest liquor Authority has fractured in pots or no damage Eva gardenias hydrotherm in almost any reliable situation absolutely tracking really jungle routes it is a full clear red side for the rexha and bladder is doing the other fairly popular Red Bluff should Lube up to prom so both of those paths will hit level 350 wise you can see right side when to fight just a little bit but not far behind and they maybe this is close to a full clear but most likely just picking up blue and then trying to fight for this go on a little bit. Has been pushed in by licorice hanser the second one to level two going to grab what pharmacy can is a ways do push towards them and CSC 3rd ways die how close they all are far right now licorice iced tea on purpose vs so far last two to go 18 and a full 1960s first we waved at yourself when you match up zero gold drop and now he's going to be able to get award that is likely going to see rek'sai oh yeah oh pretty much perfect right there on knowing that he has blabber relatively close by over Raptors and because he's pushed in is going to give blabber at least early access on the scale crab not going to deal with it as whatsoever is going to get cancel easier for bladder with your thing up to take right now for clothes or his Hospital the Cubs responding and their properties ignoring so mostly getting afraid of the early jungle camps had to track that because level 3 jumpers are so powerful two big braids down here but keep has a great help he'll be fine and of course they're jumpers on top of that they know he's going to stop by the closest here first so can't go any farther forward clothing size of that store for a short time stop playing play goes in but 70s difference liquor so far can a better job it is late again Advantage matchup make it was dropped from the threat back though repeat walks away fix another shot from a family house and they get away for an only the one summoning spell down to the bottom side down or something like that but still give tutoring jobs in a hot to be safe up there looks like about a tenth of a second before licorice would die to that aatrox W pulling him back in much narrow margins on that top Wayne dive is the drum group had kind of split between the top and the bottom side of the map. Higher chance of killing the top Wing but also higher chance of failure interesting enough we'll keep it on the top side there is hotter does not get to wear stop and effect did lose his Flash the play Flubber traded his for the honor and toddler switching out so you must be available to a repeat game yeah it's going to be interesting to see how this game kind of ends up breaking his generally don't see killed in the Tomcat plane that's just what he does as a champion box link to me is what Kylie volatile right now so I generally like what blabber has been doing being able to steal the first wrong getting his second crop that's one of the Jungle camps it had not been diminished in value in the offseason so that's the one you want to farm the most so that's that's why is he black or level five right now I'm not falling into that XP pit but a lot of jungers find themselves in early looking now at the Midland goldenglue do not afraid of any crowd control going to walk with big beat level six pack up their stuff does Wayne the drought being a follow-through going to be there as well what's your HP got an owie short- last night to make sound stays alive and look how about how far is this key nearly drop down 7 to go fishing a lot of plates but we're still TV back in not64 close our own little for can't get much done for kids who want to start the Drake how do I get my charger over here but now in the topside another flight going in right there licorice does not get away from the cage he has to land a steel shot has a flash way closer is here the minion wave going to be here around 2. He has to be singing at the first flood coming through the closer and actually licorice all things to the Rex TIE fighter put pots are out of tournament so I thought it level six Camille that could be a little dicey been over off great play bipod should I give him the credit for that one hitting sticks first and getting y'all and I'll Liquors before he was able to his system self ocean Drake was claimed by closer go to the comes down in time to stop the red bumps filled Hill for a Drake yep and gold actually even but that chocolate matchup between a socks and Camille can be quite volatile should have time to get a look at blabbering vulkan support dual-sim variable to make a kind of follow each other to the next place but again with that Tom Kent being in the bottom line just so hard to make anything happen cancel liquor should stick so he the way he tried to help us all something to eat right before direct ion burrows for it to end up working because then you would have been able to kind of Enoch up trapperman and off the atrox away but what you got knocked up the damage they have the level eat up your aunt lives in a good spot right he's got this way freezing point of a stir it and Hunter is losing Every Blooming that dies no gold no XP put some deep voice thing back right now he is not have been charged play the land yet again but that's can't afford to be quite dangerous for him, pushing back into court as Lube Midland farm so far in this matchup yeah I think about two-thirds of that is mysterious and vulnerable hard to tell without being able to watch the lane all the time and then the other third is that slaver his had good River control and generally good Vision that is forcible than group to play more passively I was just going to point out there's a big moments going on in that pot playing Stefan sir was going to keep at 3 but licorice ended up taking a calculated risk and actually pushed us to reset the way so now he's kind of out of the very dire situation and back to equipment Villa level deficit do for him for TVs were down when that first Hill happened up there so I had to sacrifice that waiver to don't know beans Wave lyrics to You're blabbering soldiers fought each other lamp. Coming through so FBI on the scoreboard now as well yeah for a second I wasn't sure which team has 10 and now it's either going to be the average saving play or the thing that makes it a one-v-one so good one-to-one play by blabber right there actually if you think about the total creative objectives it's just an ultimate a Teleport and you get to 141 so probably worth it but overall games
there goes one of my right now I think there were going to at least be upgrading their Academy theme in a kind of over the years they've been trying to fill this out and and create more of a system from which they can pull players up to their LCS Squad I think that's something a lot of the team did not all the teams really should be working on because you can find such a valuable player one really strong player that is a North American player that can be so valuable in the ALCS because that's a really don't need to import that's a rule that is really really worth a lot was watch the first pick up Elias they'll both be on the table like a collie and rumbel we're looking around what they might really want to do it yeah cuz his give me the Pick he is a very very strong later his face as a super low but his spells do so much damage is choosing 145 damage in that basement level twocast the paperwork you have to leave to get to Berkeley off and auto attack does a whole lot of course actually cared up with his dad has a very big deal gorica skid play afelio to yesterday again had a great game fun at 519 who he was Dead Poets on the broth that aired up with a bellios wife are the most and it's also actually very good into MF using that at Braum's Shields are to block out the ultimate so I would be very surprised if both Gardens don't grab from here that's also good at 2 or not I really think it's it's kind of a bit of a Mystic if you're not going to grab that really on because it's that can also be taken away by five 9 and yep yeah I mean you have to bring up Pandora and it's like screaming take from pairs well with a belly oh so I think it was only picturessing at least you with all this stuff right but the NFL come through I feel like it's so much harder for you also to be in the right place at the right time every time feel the Block Please add fpv that was paired to Bomb by fromis is very consistent remind me of the shield you just jump back to 80s of Those Nights by the way doesn't really matter what we do have an Ori grabbing me Olaf he's going to be able to have a lot of her also taking a lot of jumpers do light because it is for the junglers that if you like to go that route can actually powerform very very heavily doing antennas keep up more and golden experience with those Bowl winners that has complained of most if not all junglers these days as they feel that they are still under levels compared to the rest of the game so I will see how an orrery want to try to play this outbut yeah I'm looking at you know the jungle and then Gangsta Lane with about two axes and even try to run down to mordekaiser who is going to try to walk away very slowly I mean if you want to do that they're going to have to drop some more gangstas here or at least an option to go up to that top side but the more pictures of very good matchup you know especially if they are not going to get into rupted up and do that horn Oriana good blind pick and it does kind of work well with you all off with the speed up but again you're not the most powerful gang cats it though and let their last tech support pick your diamond that is really going to be kind of calling in Horry down to that bottom Lane didn't really have a ton of options on where to go and and those types of cases I tend to think the plan becomes pushing your lanes allow him to Whole Lotta Rosie jungler route map in here for heart my mind goes to Leona number one most advanced support intro play so far this patch she is left up for my can tell it's a bitand would work quite well tonight. But if you just want to go Leona and play take the board into another tank 4th then it's pretty surprising to me that you are acting too blind pick your midline do it is going to be fun with the Oahu you can actually speed them up and throw a bump on his head he can run in and actually extends I've been kind of a the wife of the Olaf in the game because a lot of people talk with all of his falling off very heavily late-game if you have a billion behind you you actually can have his late-game relevant the attic damage from the bomb Is wealth revive in the GF give you the ability to take out something scaryDerek Billy have a plan here if it's two different email Mages to support a noise Olaf he's going to go Cleaver II item budget upgrade that for him as well like we're going to see in Horry jokes about I do cop right here a lot of damage Victorino is very good at fellios is the most prized but later said you got more damage to the stadium with with talk to her that's really good up there as well yeah it really should I will say it does usually take an item for to completed before you can really start bullying you and will not match up early as bored but it has the ability to to do a fill-in to win last in a surprising fashioned against many many match up so you have a little bit more, behind you if you can get up to something like literally liandry's then it becomes incredibly powerful the profanity he with that on top of your passive you're stealing the fast when you open men's that's when you can really start to take over and looksplay that style I think that's only said Zion Spartan know what kind of know for back in the days though they be looking for a little bit that's why are looking for a little bit of cycling dominant will be playing soon don't worry too much about this one go to go to academy in Cloud 9 Academy going to be doing battle soon enough diamond and I'll chat r a d c is Boom great I love that they're probably some sort of issue there 4K out hopefully get right back in again pretty quickly but the war in solo queue it is from you know when I have seen it and played it myself a fairly weak support in the early levels really all you have is is that your Mom's done right and if you actually can't hit that you're very skeptical to all Lids you have to think that they're going to have to lose quite possibly the only kind of real option they have is is just run a hard shove and reset and not really interact with their opponents if you're trying to play a bit more up utilizing you know that the kind of a weed image from the bombs on the mini wave but you're playing at the Valley West Bromwich has incredible gang cyst and at least it so if you're pushing or putting yourself in such a vulnerable spot with no gravity of root of the Bron passes done know that that type of thing does connecting and you can just be screwed well I'm going to take a quick break to the council desk as raza's satisfied with all of them as she runs the interview guys I am running the interview is just going to have to deal with it all right this isn't I know you're the new coach of Golden Gardens Academy very exciting for you we don't get to see on the casting desk anymore but I want to talk about your team tell me about this roster because it's the first time I've ever seen him onstage driving honestly the moment I got into the gym and we had our first meetings super, individuals all of them smart soft-spoken all of them were able to have on his conversations with each other and it makes it super easy for Gorka you know the rookie coming into the team to really act Lemay to the situation so I think it's a perfect team set-up you guys have a lot of veterans on the team do they kind of adopted a teacher-student mentality with Gorga after every game and scram could just like to have long conversations with Pookie and they can just trade ideas like I think it's honestly one of the best situations for a rookie to come in with there hasn't been any hazing there has their absolutely not they have to go through me by the way I will let it happen he's not going to let it happen. Last question for you, I'm kind of curious about the philosophy with the golden Guardians and switching around are potentially switch around any lcsn Academy players cuz we seen a couple teams do it before in the past is that something that you think is there is potential for is always potential but I think stability for all players is what they want because they want to set themselves up to succeed so if it makes sense then that's going to be the conversation but we always give players on the main theme in the academy team the chance of the academy team wants to be given the chance to be stable with this roster go back to the Caster's it would be good interview buddy really well done rising up back in the day back when they used to throw out bearing all the time so we can salt it you know he was he was one of the coaches that allowed the team to throw out bearing whole lot will see if it's different this time around Dickies infected to Golden Gardens Academy start with that and so far so they're safe sadly King could not connect the Wii remake the lobby players all hop out we make a new one players all hop band and then we try around 2 and hopefully can this time we'll make it in hopefully you'll be able to get this going pretty quick should be able to fly through picks and bans wants everyone is in the lobby but it is actually really fun seeing Raz coaching in a cat is the guy who is great we've obviously works with a lot over the years casting of insulin it's really fun for me to see him there and I wish him all the best but thus far you know they are undefeated so 100% win rate for as with the Golden Gardens got me so far as we're only 9 game of the season so far, it's otherwise Team Canada is Team Canada from top it all the way down to coach I would I would almost be no want to play in French but like they're not all french-canadian it says like no reason to be really disappointed if you could only Far Eastern Canada conversion in elvive course but not a lot so you think he's going to be Grease 3 typical Canadian culture to be very aggressive towards other people and you know it's one of the country is a fellow Canadian play I took a bunch of notes for this game really stupid for example what are my notes was ironic that we've got Cloud fees it's not a very good point like I mentioned I think it's funny you're right that's Bobby what else can I do on a Raspberry I mean the Raptors maybe maybe you Rebrand basketball Toronto Raptors so you know she never went again Toronto alright so we are getting through the picks and bans and hopefully we'll have this going for you very quickly wow who could have seen this coming. Everybody or that yep all right what final drive to be locked in at least then gets crab in the final Champion is the Victor and then Diamond locks in the pocket Pig zillion gazillion is I think not enough players consider going Relic Shield instead of spell thieves now I think zillion actually needs a man region I think he's such a manner hungry Champions you actually need the man of reason that bail fees now gives in 10.1 on words but if it wasn't important one word the oldest out of his health health in a p I would consider going Relic Shield just because I'm not going to land her ass very easily all the time especially when Broncos can actually get some fuel pressure like just Auto attack for Relic Shield products like who cares what the difference is like 15 1800 ml but it's actually use for that cuz I am someone who goes Relic Shield in a sports is just if it is a match up where you have to play defensive we're not actually able to trade consistently then Relic Shield is is going to serve you better right kind of similar to if you're playing coin in somebody's defensive matchups prior right if you're playing on me or something and it says to Progressive match up where you can't trade you if we don't know I do think at least in the early levels is pretty easy to actually proc off of Brom I'm not sure which way he will go Relic Shield you know could work pretty well I have seen some zilean support even do things like Relic Shield and identity r n t r u feeling like hatch need a man of this badly that I'm glad she brush aside and then not really complete at Unity Redemption whatever and those types of things can work pretty well but it's a very heavily scaling build on a very heavily feeling Champions you're really kind of like back loading your power out towards later in the game so which way Diamond wants to go he is playing Arie he is going Cosmic Insight so wouldn't be surprised if this gets his balls Man full band kind of help out with some of those men issues and we'll find out pretty quickly if he's going to go spell thief's end he is there with all the pretty everybody Sports Battlefield and all that kind of stuff so yeah he's
baby eye color affect be so as work if those responsibilities will be kind of solely on Alton what are the stars of the team and and I'm kind of curious need to fill that role here as well take them band is that a lot of surprises here with the likes of Rumble akali band away if it was always gone if it has been the most highly prized regular worldwide so far this fast and not a shock to see that one dropped out either that you're looking for toppling counterpick you're trying to ban away from the state picks up their horn really does have such a stall laning phase quite a strong leader and skills can probably well into later to the game I'm afraid very powerful Viper we'd know at his best what country is Dominic Gary Player in the LPS doKadabra Evolution left on the table have right now by Immortals but I've been getting played another reason to look for something else values this pain and we doesn't has basically always played as the 80 Carey it's like 90 10 down there yes we can see if taking over a family of a solution doesn't get from here to talking a little bit more about play if it looking for really really well for supporting those types of 1Tamar Braxton for cowardice and try to extend van leaves like leaves a bit later pretty early on here as well for guess you can speak has to be a top but it's for off in the Middle Lane of here as well so very early on I mean that was the question be honest I suppose was you know how to commit 2B fit into a roster with more question marks than statements and he says I think Mark was thinking if he's going to be solid all-round is at the Psychedelic experience a blicky got the check is already wouldn't be surprised Steve moriana hear a lot of people do like that match up in the Casio is considered a fairly good one in the lady face or orianna and how are people still comfortable on that champion Victor another good matchup and another one that is really in the Wheelhouse of power of evil I think it was kind of outrage and poke down the Casio utilizing the Freddy how old are the rest of these big Tira devil eyeswhat was the potato most likely it is going to be Cassiopeia mid who can borrow as you're saying but you do always have to come and give the respect of these and come it does make it very very dangerous to know if Casio work to go up in that Top Lane lease in Leslie Camille post office 6 is pretty much doomed for Casio doesn't have really to remove what kind of get away and it ate most of those games I have found a better flyquest what else they can respect here from the Mortal side looks like the guy was laughing like that one in and dragged ass off the jungle table here so pretty standard Jungle Band beate Phillies gragas with the least is taken awayyeah do a couple of AP junglers have been banned out we have the least we have to drag us those taken off the table Rex I still available at my guess of where Mortals might go it is barely strong or League anchor but he is very comfortable and good matchup into the lease in so that's kind of where I'm at doing Immortals will look to how to look there for some time ketchup and Away we'll see flashes - 1 Pinnacle sportflics but they're going to replace a very very exciting stuff here the blitzcrank pretty spicy a lot of players do enjoy this pic into these other folks doing that kind of wind up an animation before those Bobcat utility fairly local economy Bilbo support items and things like that on utility when it comes to those device in the last eight trucks and Cavs vs which role that I doubt is going to happen here and we never going to see what the final picks going to be fly plus Noah's Ark is a chart to top whey liquid web for Mordecai and Viper going to bring a CFA Islamic ribbon did bring fly by spinner number of when it is left open he's going to go for that aggressive matchup he has strong early you support here from the lease in and he does have the penultimate crossmap squats do for any sort of Dives or any aggressive won't be one plays the back to be pretty big and black was on that bottom kind of has to say hi Temple acid and leave because when you start to lose control the map when you lose vision control becomes very ineffective you know your full name could be off the hook in the ones that your man right here, right here pay here on Saturday for 4 days of play today or tomorrow and on Monday here as well while Turtle longtime LPS that are a very big but you got on your team. POA who loves resource on that Victor I do like it's worth noting this is going to be a Lucian bits and pieces ignite press the attack Lucian mid so they did want to avoid that Cassio into Victor match up with can be quite difficult and I could hear could be looking very very aggressive power of evil does pick the phase Rush it's actually really helpful against trundle ganks because tunnels closed you down with that Feller and if you can practice aids rash have a much better chance of just kind of waiting out back and getting away is purple has no heart CC CEO Tricia I'm here Trisha what you guys are starting to go green initiative where I believe for every Victory you're going to plant 100 trees that could be 1800 trees in a split are you ready for that hell yeah tell me a little bit about what sparked this initiative and why it's important for flyquest want to showcase greatness and we believe everyone has greatness within them and we want to help facilitate way to do that are go green initiative it says my everybody to help save our planet and one of the coolest things I think is coming out from flyquest is the flower in the floral spring jerseys who was the inspiration from that and does the flowers have any significance absolutely so we're doing a few things that you can Bona is Japanese flower arrangements that's how you say it and our Jersey represents nature and nature is you know beautiful it is graceful but it also has strengthened that's going to be your inspiration for 5 months this year and we want everyone to remember to appreciate nature and have gratitude every time you see the flowers thank you so much and best of luck to you in a team cuz I want to see some trees planted back to you guys but you're on the way and we are in a game I personally and play Crib for the LCS itself and thank you very much baby of course for sure as well as you get a broken sword vs. Viper push you away at the very beginning or actually going for a long story 3 plot start here so may want to play a little bit aggressive has a lot of staying here in these really leveled with that three health potions in I dedicate to know when we could watch vipers ribbon earlier on last year at tended to be run the 60-minute mark you'd really come on lines are taking over games big swing to get like double kills of all combos and stuff so I'm personally talked to him at least expect like a 20ft is leading the first 10 minutes of your life was playing pretty defensive on this bottoms by here early on weekends he isn't wearing his bearing down on his bottom side and it looks like he went to work as we have to re-buy she going to get knocked up in time but it's still a CSF it down there there is to be a week from power of evil in him she had the extra potions remaining an extra charge on the crafting potion now she two extra charges as well as that's it and so is heavily in the event is there and they're looking for potential form and I've hear here comes the plague victim in the front pillar comes by 40 peas that was pushing out they get more gold out of it here also however you will have fun going to be picked up support brace for absolutely nothing and I'll check his on the porch that is huge Altec anaika the two main carries wrapping kills your early on for Mortals you're at the time one more time very well time out Immortals bot Lane is level 350 coming down here a little free IQ level for plastic in picking up that first Blood a great book from ignore to actually trade back in Viper committing for here does try to go in for the kill by chocolate still have the flash available and they're able to catch power of evil you just kind of walking back on a dangerous route he walked over that word was five he has my phone down there was no way out for him and that pillar looks so weird push it back a little bit Wright III v a minute later but you know what credit to him I want to give some slack Rafi we do had flash burned after the fight could have flashed Let's Get Away. The recall on the midline we go with a 1,000 gold lead for immortals is PP was not for nothing he did get a kill so so as that's have helped or Advantage which could be Immortals looks to make a dragon play and on that box out of the map I think that could be present intelligent they have already seen the bottom Lane pretty heavily and now you have a big Siesta vintage year for all that and he got the kill which allows them early to your by so he could have tons of Mana to be able to actually push up and it seems as fresh we should open up and early now I'm dragon look so go ahead and try to protect Turtle to him backwards goes in a straight line no thicker off there still Gold Leaf or Immortals look like basically everywhere you're seeing CS leads in literally every single light except for Jungle Missy look at it and they have plenty of time to dance playlist rate for you eat it look a lot of fun there for the backwards good colon damage but the truth is far. Both those players going to walk away still adjust me some Farm as lost as many minutes were picked up for no gold Frontier seat cover act will be pushed out though is lead a little bit of ice dare to try to get I got a bit of Cs but it's slow so he's going to have to back off and see some of his farm over to thin or who is it be closing in on level six and made it look to make an appearance of this flash available when leasing does got that ultimate he could try to make something happen set up the mafia Vice solution skin enjoy the Nyan scheme of that one is Father's Day question no problem it's cool to see all take back in this is what I came for changes on the fee for the last 2 years or so with league is the non-emergency hotline as about later mostly myself I really do like seeing all the extra Scamp he's out there and I'm glad that I'll text her everyday view the LPS is half of it to you like we see purchase receipt apps do it they didn't go Bartlett I'll play Madden 12 and I think that's kind of like a battle pass little bit but you still see lots of Jocelyn Castillo in solo queue that is played fairly frequently you also still see some I'm her down there and Sanctuary how to fix a minion not going to find a re-engage by forget the way for the bolt back though it's so as this forcing Old South horse looking to buy some face at Turin Warehouse just get away and it's just good cover for me so I can reset the way to get to save face here not going to be losing anything from that and Viper because he was why would he has no teleport he's actually going to lose that wave up on the top side in it a little bit pricey stand for on Spring Street towards bought but perhaps worried about the jungle
after that it's only one game sample size tonight there and I respect the commitment it's your or a hundred you know if you're going to die you're going to do something freaky so I will see if he can bounce back and get first place tonight and I'm more preferable stat after this game playoffs themselves and I'm curious that does coming through downtown line or be to drop the game and you know there's there's penis in contention for a first part of the group of course we are going to Hampton dropping gear as well of course the person fudge were both on or Duty last day of the liquor self 1040 is it was a rough one but what time does an accident so that will get dropped off the table Joliet dropped off as well and so did Ali is going to be very quick lock in the black websiteI wonder if I die will just try to take away in one of those priority toppling or something cuz I think Mike combo with in Italy like if they're worried about me something like the community that we have seen all those types of picked you can go towards that of what the fudge is comfortable just answering with a different pic then they can just sit back and wait blabber to be on his Kindred this is really I think we're getting no Dillion type combo that he was playing in any of them is very good on a lot of these arrange jungler so I'm going to be excited to see Kindred it's not a champion we've been seeing a ton of we've been seeing as far as that the range of a kind of grave but not really a lot of Kendra and I think you know Kendra Ken work pretty darn well in this meta does scale very well as long as you're picking up Mark to get the additional ranged how you can be quite effective galio obviously a nice combo there alongside the Kindred you can timer galio ultimate as the kids are alt is expiring you come down you taught them up U-verse them down as they come out of that Kendra Dalton at low HP or at leastthe idea and also does feel like it setting out for potential third pic of a cavile a for fudge if life wasn't want to grab her right now and looks like they're not going to be going forward instead taking Hydro the Champions we see Jinn taken pretty early on blue side a lot so far NLCS login and has generally been the most highly prized to Port so not come through as well and if you want you can grab it and end up with two bands no problem in that can be caught ideally flying that style and then we'll see how that one runs down. They also put away put their head coach in reproducing this the first time it's denied it several years with a big kid have been coaching staff rain over now head coach for Smithy they're right behind him in a course for the first really dominant G2 era was with those did while playing together it's navigate to see what else can come through is it is the camile's you called out so good job is sale that big brain is what push all the hair out of your head and that you knowGalaxy brain yeah obviously it could be parks that are like we got last name for a working very well for them in the early game of course I wasn't really able to convert them to leave that he did a crew for himself alongside his teammates so I will see what time does want to do just the threat of the flex is always really nice affected when you are playing with its really pick like that having the possibility of a flight at least make your Florence consider that this could be going in either role and sometimes can dictate whether or not they would want to pick midlane right away here or save it for lateralrighty welt looking at the band coming through a midline Pam and a Top Lane band to preserve the syndra and one more to come through Aflac Westside and talk to Euless down by enough you know I'm not sure if it's Alice Through what you're going for I do kind of agree with the idea that it seems like galio is the mid laner here I just because it does piss a composition that said you know who knows I can do for you on anyway I mean you didn't actually pretty good. Good galio delivery Champions effect would be hardly surprised if his fortunes have been somebody passed will get to see her blade very often she's always seemed very strong as well and then to be part of a really tough matchup for Camille to taking that off is pretty night there's not a lot of other like Camille counters that people really seem to play in Pro play when you look towards solo queue people fly things like Darius sometimenothing that you really do see in competitive play hardly at all and then there is the more kind of extreme anthers like if you want to try to go for a range pick you can go towards things I like them but my guess is at this point we're just going to be a team fight comp we might be getting born again or even a malphite who I think can work pretty well into Camille early on I think I'm out they would fit well with this composition you have Ariana you have a lot of gold buttons there for the follow-up for the Shockwave pretty powerful. Did you know ultimate coming over the top 10 were pretty well also is there's a lot of squishy members over on cloud nine so that could be pretty nice of your will be really yeah this is exciting this is coming much more to that side lane play we have not been seeing what you're in a long time even when it has felt like it fits really well to Perry's a great shot are there is sometimes a little mini game working me a wolf joke. To the wall and then try to hold the hookshot or try to do it you know by pulling the furore right to the wall and then stand against it kneeling in front of the Pointe Blank ones you cannot reactEric because if you are going to react and Perry your hook shot and stun you with that is also reduced taxi dispatch that Perry and Dora can be one if you are able to do that that being said you're cannot do that Camille definitely does have some really nice trade-in to her and and does have the potential to win this one we want for this is going to be exciting top leaders trying to prove their worth Rite Liquors have replaced by this guy and busting out the Fiora against them licorice to get enough money to buy out perks to get the rest of my YouTube to take that buy out there so don't worry about it like fudge can just replace you like you just kind of been poured anymore so we've got room in the roster honestly it's it's not really even came out and they are brainless it's likeall right so if you're coming to match up with go right on the top side because it's going to be a I think he comes in as the expected the best player on this team on flag and he was stuck on on duty and it was a 0-4 start it was not pretty it ended 04 by the way as well as starting and were the exact same thing it wasn't it wasn't great but now he's back here he's on a big carry it's going to be a lot of stop playing also but I'm certain look at that one what is that because perks his camping gear to work alongside fudge so we're going to have to see how mxim Palafox can protect licorice from what feels pretty inevitable in a Galia World moving up toward that topside trying to attack if you are a yes you can try to save your Perry as that galio is coming in with the ultimate and then you're not going to have it for the Tom potentially or even the hookshot so it can be difficult to play around that but we'll see how flyquest is able to manageout there in that Top Lane because if your can get ahead that is a clear Side Lane wind condition but galio Camille always so frightening and park is going to be playing Predator so really wants to focus on the Rome wasn't expecting him to go rock it felt even help that more I didn't see if like West saw the word with out of the river but I've been impressed by every single game someone's like this with a wart is and possibly pretend they're right every time I know an in-game one or at least get me week after going to go we're lost. The T Ford in it's like okay expectation is that like this so it's probably there and was right it's still a present that these players no, Tennessee is there a bunch of everything and I'm right this is where they were we're going to get some extra golden XP and vision yeah so I'm pretty good start will be in to see how I was venting Vulcan her to be able to do down here against diamond and Johnson has been in Vulcan obviously were known as as one of the most dominant bot Lane in the ALCS especially in Spring they were absolutely crushing it and it is PGA on the MF I'm not sure where you stay at these bills I've been seeing a lot of people in high heel of go for the kind of comment here lethality styled build and I just looking to bully with it he's of poked that MF can bring a lot of the gym Builder the go boots for potions you can get out of the Dodge Make It Rain a bit more easily or just going to circle the sooner I feel like you to stay in really nicely so I don't get a lot of Headway doing a really heavy folk build in Al Ain like this little that you actually like change anything and then just before they all lens which are going to happen cuz Aleister Liotta so in this case I actually like him going for a more Auto tax base to build a fan of Debbie Maxon on MFM playing her more as an auto attacker place we're good and play around the devil up but regardless near the top side is canker sore to heal ready to fight for top Scuttle Natalie not far behind both top and Morty ward of that brush that they know what's going on but it's been licorice I had so far in the matchup I'm glad we're fighting over this one perks shows up first but the oryana close behind licorice now going to be here as well as fight fight going to ensue and it's going to go to Flubber pick up the first bark liquor in the bottom side how to walk away book really nicely done you can also see that use of the phase Rush allowing Vulcan to catch up with Jonathan to try to escape but not able to get out of there till about 9 winning on both sides they get the schedule and pop they kill off Johnson down in the bot Lane and they get his Bend to have the kill to hear this one more time Johnson just stepping forward a little bit too far involved in finding the opportunity to actually go for this as Johnson I think he's he just want to step toward actually get that for shot on his bed the Vulcan seize the opportunity to the splash Shield comes out but it's even see you immediately and then use her right back up slap the gin and sets up VIN for that Ezekiel meant up on my top side. The replay on this this might is nailed there by flaveur you can see the Perry came out from licorice but they just had to go back into a full Retreat and knowing that they were pretty far down in hell yeah it's like in different Excel as well was just a fraction of a second too early and set it up for this might come through anyway and get claimed by bladder there was also a box that's going to feel good Cloud 9 on the bottom side of a Vulcan obviously again a good job by the head of pulverize Johnson didn't Flash the head but he flashed after the Sun and as you mentioned phase Rush makes me taste that one so no big deal with the fact that you know what you can take it slow push put out of that use that to go for the dragon and his face was good not going to be denying much Farms been feels are reasonably safe get out he's got plenty enough to get away from diamond in most cases ultimately yeah liquor is quicker than that side of the map and Italy's going to begin the Dragon and it is pretty scary now for Johnson as well because if you are pushing up you know the Vulcan cells is flash drive in diamonds going to have to be there to try to break up any potential Q flash into a head but backwards style of combo very dangerous you can see blabber is down here and very likely is going to look for that Q Flash and try to head-butt Johnson back so they have to back it up on this Dragon they haven't spotted Johnson flash season trouble Johnson shut down easily be well start plus the Dragon z9r smashing so far they are looking so good already and Johnson play for the plated Steel Cast with flash and flash to expect for it was going was not the gas Palafox with Bays restaurants in a kind of wager on the way out but it means that he's getting back up 30 couldn't get away I was going to say poop difference down there with the fact that first has more boost 3059 they are looking really really good already in asking a question when you are falling behind this early on I know you have never really been a fan of nothing rolled it just got spotted we was dragging he's already very low it down he didn't want to just try to stay around so just kind of getting caught out there Johnson separated from his team is jungle a very low on the Dragon no flash on Jen so he gets taken down very easily they lose the dragon and he's got way behind itemization to be honest to you know this is not going to be doing much of anything stir if only he let us kill shot in time would have been a 1/4. The reply Quest but they will stay off the board licorice he's able to keep himself alive but he's going to lose a lot of farm down there in his help keep that 480 Carrey alive Jen got the news feed about the armor to not quite. Ms so quickly that that was just doesn't seem like a villain in any problems but if you get that we've stalled out so if you're out of man in your kind of stuck in that awkward position licorice could actually taken all in and probably kill you fudge you can see his old was already on cool down here to Mrs oakshott a pretty critical Rome they are from Parks to reset the way from 5 to really help him out cuz he didn't have to be he didn't have any manner and in that one V one in that position are you are either going to get the way Frozen on you or you're going to get killed by licorice so a good job I purchase helping out but you it was having a little bit of trouble and that one's you want and now if I put the top hair old is that one spawns up we've got the porch railing over the 80 carries doing the same as vents in Bates walking your buddy is already left on that one the I can be popped by train for a while though and
on the LPS stage let's go and end I am I'm excited to see how these players grow over time and and could reinvent himself because he had the LCS title right he had that MSI finals downhill for a while from him and and he was part of the sealed you something down and down and down and getting more disappointing and now he gets to reinvent they look up of the roster were all going to show up we're all going to rise up and then get good again I mean he start can really do something great for you right you know if you've been kind of stuck in a ride at Six a has been with seals me for quite a long time even just a changing environment I really can do you good right you know maybe he can't have that Resurgence he is obviously the it's kind of like a clone veteran Force here on this team and as far as the LCSC concerned and we'll see if he can impart some wisdom on younger players if they canreally start to improve throughout the course of the split because to me that is a benchmark vs stats for Golden Guardians is getting better throughout the split seeing improvement from these young players because of golden Guardian can find you one or two young players that are from an essay that they can build around for the future. Hey baby New Year to you import players around them and all the sudden you're pushing for a championship yeah we'll see what happens if maybe it turns out that you don't know how is the next Licorice and iconic is the next blabbering we're going to keep dating C9 players and he's fix a one plcs in his first replaced and still want to fly to like these players I want to see that we have seen players pop off instantly I want to go back and let's think about world how many times is there a first-year like you've got all the guys who like showed up for semifinals the what year did when it's like the next like that you can pop off early on but let's focus on things are going to win WorldWorld Sierra from Collegiate world champions league world champions it's it's basically the same level of play Thalia locked in for iconic played good yesterday gets to play another high impact II Farm high damage has made based on the world record for most good top laners arcare EAD Champions I protected and Camille going to see that speak against the stamp was tragic I think we'll pay trash on Cane but going to go ahead and just give him a hug and Italy and he'll pick something else soon I do like it is at throwing that out there as you said you know these two Champions combined very well with lot of the meta top laners in a reactant is already banned out so they go to Camille I would love to see who needs a lot of Jack's here I think the Jackson Italy can fight very effectively against Camille as well as to Leah at the 1D wind is favorable to Jack's you out scale the Camille in that side lengths it is obviously has lots of like a reliable engaged that's really the only big advantagewhat kind of has a in their nara's what Tony played yesterday and did not have a good time on it and this is perhaps the safer option but a lot of people feel that Camille can actually win this one if you want it you can get all A's on the Nar in Minion are other is the potential to actually punish this pic that means that if you are not playing aggressively in that top line or if you were put on the back foot these bayley versus rangemasters become incredibly difficult very very quickly if you're under your turret getting poked away at by the Gnar and losing current place you can fall behind in a hurry so I will see how iconic in Niles can really going to pair up to try to punish you need to be is it feel like a super hard counter over all I know he played it yesterday as well as to what he went right post it as very very slightly in our favorite but like under 1% and hey you can take your greatest out with that data Pro play that was different but you know it's not like you're taking Silas into malphite where it's just the most free Mac of all timedial to me I think his most iconic Champion is Camille here like this is one that I seen it really pop on he plays a lot of so that's exciting office in Golden Garden to take your legality of me and they're clearly going for that that hard and Gates I'll leave them there of the Galaxy to get him there is another very aggressive composition with global pressure we saw the authority band display the galley oh yeah you can you can play that midlane you can also Play That's before I think that is also completely fine with missing a fair bit of galio support and some of the other Pro regions a couple of those marks and bands coming over to Ward's fix a he did play the caixa yesterday which is already been down so caixa MF to Mira all taken off the table Jin already grabbed out there for a loss so I really putting out a lot of priority on getting what should be a winning bought lay here for TSM people very excited about sword are coming over here seeing what he can do Fresh Off The World Championship Finals is this player and we'll see what he'swill be going for as his back because it is going to the last pick 4 Sword Art so does feel like yes you can use your lactic support to try to round a proposition for generally when you do that you want to try to pick for the winning to be too and I think that in combination with the fact that I already have multiple marker Advance feels like they're going to try to go for a winning to be too and try to bully Newby and 6 a looking for it take to get to go back to the other is a support I think it works quite well for the gate to let me know you can move your midline to something else I thought you might just like Delia based on just I look like he had before and serafine's also an option I think she's a good men and supports that still leaves the question in the air now I got to go for it I was right after allSuperstore. We'll see if it does mean a lot of damage and little pressure across the squad is going to have a lot easier time linking up with a Camille especially in the earlier stages the game that it support Gallia what that's larger why they're guaranteed and gave Galileo ultimate on top of the Camille ultimate you're locked in the hextech ultimatum does a very powerful in the side lane if uni is is exhausted if you make an ARG you're stuck in that may need our form you can all in on that for sure to Leah's ultimate behind you get Ulta din by kambi old galio comes in on top you are very Squishy in that mini in our form and you can get a first down so we'll see how well they can play around it the power of evil can, try to keep Ablaze all of locked in his laying a speaker can be around behind him he's trying to protect him from those sorts of all in because it does feel like they're going to be playing heavily through that and the last pick out there hear this that's feels more like it's for the team flight and just having kind of some guaranteed ball delivery here and engaged I rather than for the lane because I dohow to write she was playing it on the turnaround who is on point field layout a lot of those Alice are engaged in the 2 V 2 of course there is a potential for Q Flash in these sorts of shenanigans but it's not the most reliable as far as what I thought they were going to do you know going for a wedding to be to which maybe you would have gone to work like a Morgana or something like that try to answer threshing wind Lane devices really accurate is the head but when Camille dies on it with Jen or someone or Ian it's like okay if you had but the Camille out that breaks the ultimatum right nothing else to do with you and the actual spell itself if you kick her out then it ends and that's how you can let your teammates 5 to safety or find some way to get away from galio overall that's me and was like what it's about and we are on for this one golden Guardians started off LCS walk in with a win over counter logic gaming actually just CLG their official name TSM also by the way not team selected or just TSM they are on the right side a long timebut that's one of the very strongest teams in North America you can give him a small pass as it is early on for the roster Lords of the top Golden Gardens going to spot themselves on a wart and there's always going to get softer stuff for anything but I believe who near actually most likely be speaker who dropped the one that came back for a sweeper early defense of vision there and because they spotted them out we can see that lost sexy invading to get award down of his own very defensive start early Lane Ward and bought Lansing if they were so I don't know if this is just kind of scouting out what Golden Gardens has been doing in scrims or something like that but it felt like he s m was very much expecting the potential level 1 invade here of course to Leah has a very powerful level 1 know maybe something to do with just the Champions that they had picked but she isn't ready for it they do spot it out and stopped that so we'll see where they want to take us from here as a loss is going to be starting Lane doesn't have to leash because because starting up on that tablesite on the Redbox and it is going to give them the early push year and the earlier level two very likely as well in midline is the fact that the blaze Olive share that wore gold XP across four players I believe a four-way Cher still enough resoling to get level 2 off the first wave is that might give him a little bit of pressure does not give you enough so it's kind of important I was once a day or someone else could have hidden away regardless though stop playing early push going in that grass can be tough for Camille into range Champions or is that for 80% of the game so you know it look you're going to burn your hook shot just has harassed you're not going to get much out of the Keystone yeah I mean I think we thought was it would have been at world will be something like that the Omni Stone ignite teepee style your try to answer again somebody's range matchForest Isle of course this may just be a comfort thing in or not not being used to that but generally you don't see grasp as much against the range matchups and people used to do, that is less common now but I do see more things like PTA often times I or even conquer against these has the matchups because often ends up being more about the all-in then kind of the back and forth poke our grass is going to be most effective new stacking up the bonus HP from that and just being able to get these small trades topside we no speak of the other side of the map so theoretically a chance for a dive as icon is going to take down Scuttle crab and does be fairly standard Tulia clear which is Skip wolves do everything else start bottom go to top that's going to work pretty well but ultimately just going to end up grabbing balls afterwards and doesn't go for any kind of place topside and you can see that TSM was actually paying right on that scoreworkout as iconic was doing it so I having a very good idea of where he would be home with them to be in it's always really nice when you have a jungler who is very confident of tracking this or or perhaps it was someone else doing it but no largely it is the jungler calling out where they expecting to be based on the timing based on knowing the speed of clear for those Champions at having accurate tracking going to make it a lot more safe for honey but nice for now is because you did get the fully pushing and reset the wave and he's going to be able to recall without actually having to expend the teleport so grabbing a second or inside of a year plus refillable has the door and shield now plus the blade I will be able to withstand a lot of this kind of range harass that could come through here from uni and we'll see if he's going to be able to get control in this Lane Health minion are has I think the little lowest base Health in the game at least by high levels he's eventually got less than you me you know that feeling kicks off butcost of metal a bit because the flat 3 health for trigger is at Point back at 5 minutes we know that the first dragon spawning in a second we still got three minutes to go until everything else comes up and I just like little but okay I think it back wall into the roof then out of the route they do that pulverize knocking them up in the air so pretty much maximizing the CC that they could have their to get the extra two attacks in to get the extra bit of damaged and obviously trample stacking up you get the auto tax done from Alice star on top of all of that I just really nice layering of those four different species eventually soattempted of fries from Golden Guardians was trash like it was a nice attempt to catch the way up there and it's a freeze and then a bunch of gold next PS I have to recall it was managed there's only two minutes left and it's right in front of it this way will always be a gate because it didn't register anyway it's not going to do anything bad for them so I still got to the cannon Miss Zero cast minions mrs. to mail eyes and the only tonight to mail a minions and not mean that lost them you'll get it almost all the gold XP that said when is do they still got pressure over the lane with a means that ain't no problem with the Drake and Steph exactly sono the wave gets pushed out stick that yes he's not denying any minions videos won't lose anything because you did reset it moves over to the Dragon's egg rock that for themselves so not too bad overall I would say and I was just kind of depends what you want to prioritize do you want to prioritize the gold from from a freeze or you know going for those early stacking dragons and in this case I think with Calista it can make sense to try to move towards a quick or Sol and we'll see if he'll be able to continue that Zack can go in forward okay well this talking is going all right Farm free equal across the border into drugs are going to bootcamp each other if we get a reply the top play fight that we haven't seen exactly what has happened here I can't really break down cuz I have no idea but it was okay so flash ultimate they're looking for the spear from speak of but Niles able to flash out from that so what is just a trait of flashes from those top cleaner to me obviously spending the ultimate that's not really a big deal for an are generally speaking it's up anytime you do want to use it the cooldown isn't very long but Niles going to be happy to
importantly this Herman will be dictating if break is going to Flame you or not over the next couple weeks fair to Flame it's like through this is not fair to criticize Celsius be there with flame ever matters where are you I'm I'm helping you get better for example you know dignitas have gotten rid of a lot of the players that were making them lose games and now they're winning games like you know they're going to blast your help them get better CLG I think got rid of players that help them lose games and unfortunately Replacements in in time because of these is going to be fine it's going to be setting it regardless of if we're going to have a lot of good games yesterday and I got to give a lot of freight to impact who of all players yet impact I do think you know he's less hyped than some of their players in any can go ahead and go under the radar a little bit because he has known more for his tag play more for his kind of Bruiser play than like pure carries and had playing around that but yesterday he reminded us that he can play that carry style to that he can build offensively he dominated game on Renekton they're grabbing him that were the first pic here again it's at the well for a lot of junglers in the better right now such a strong blank assistance and even some of the bad matchups there is always the opportunity to flash W's done them set up for your jugular and turn around what does that match ups but I'm going to see if Natalie Renekton is going to be in the meta whatsoever this year because we did see a lot of that at the end of last year but I haven't been seeing you as much newly it seems like in solo queue these days so I will be. See if that pops up was going to be I think second choice if it what is the best thing to Jungle in League of Legends right now I think that's the way you go for this one is back to The Mortals band I think they saw it expected to Lilia is very good show me a pic is is a tier below it that way to put the lily a steel it's like this mess going to play at least maybe not spectrum is is more diving which is Solid V cheat did Black engage I would say in the previous one they play do we are going to be already trying to damage types here comes through impact ignore can start the show and none of them have actually been banned out unless you want to say Pantheon could be a to put in the sport roll so you know you have your allistars you have your Leona's you have even set in some of these other support that can be pretty strong at engaging so it's going to be huge concern for them just yet did Ali has been fairly popular in some of the other reasons so I'm glad to see it popping up here and already has 20 + pics in Pro play so I'm scared teaming up with impact year and this is already something where revenge is going to have to pretty careful about what he is playing a lot of players in this position will just go to a norn and just try to accept a beating and hope that they don't get too far behind I'm going to be able to see if he wants to go for something a little bit more aggressive because there are all options that are considered something like a Quinn even if you are willing to play it and your team is going to play around it but with Lucien coming through I'm expecting that to be a Lucian mid which generally does draw a lot of attention from the jungler so I'm I'm already kind of not really thinking that we're going to have a carry me to carry toffee and I'll carry the jungle Mortals like we are going to have revenge on tank UTI would assume yeah I think it would be a really good choice you're so I'm curious if it going to be a lot of things bands coming through from the eegee's obviously we saw impact do swimming Lee when he kind of classy Oren and then fell asleep so you know maybe he's willing to take those matchups holds on better way it's mortgage going off the bat syndra getting off of the table as well as Lucien is fairly easily that your kind of either yeah it is because when there's an AP junglers well you know how often come through Midway and then you you were really happy generally about going towards the headshrinker and those types of place but that's just maybe more of an attack on to zooga he played this injury yesterday he did look very good on it so you maybe I'll just try to take comfort away from him push him toward something that and that he feels is going to be even better matchup for himself we can see double made fans there in a form of Mortals have one top lamp and taking away than our which is considered to be a pretty good match up into that Renekton in the ones you want of course nor does have to be careful about the jungle assistance but I am expecting you this point forward to probably just be an orphan and ask your question about you or vs. malphite I think both can be fine. Probably going up towards Revenge if we have been seeing quite a bit and I'll p l a c k I think it's a pretty strong pick and a fairly good way to clear because one of the problems that we can see happen to both of the tank that I mentioned what happened yesterday is that wrecked most accurately weighs in at the jungle comes up you get stoned off the tower right in that is what happened to budget for him so far behind you in the early stages of yesterday's game with revenge on Greg perhaps you can just use those barrels early on to thin out the wave enough that he can try to come back that push a little bit more than those tanks may be able to okay Pam here's a Dr Matt Maher you got pretty good CC Channing as well you have to have the prefix but body-slamming at the WM induction breakfast can maybe so I could die so I'm curious if you just got to hold on to that one happy to be ignoring the very very best to pretty solid as well a lot of focus needed with the delete Jen and zoi together team fights like Rowdy vs is going to be maybe a little bit suspect that's the one down to hear the Eevee Squad but they didn't have you did yesterday isn't didn't there was not one for damaged in any way to look really really good The Immortal side of course they've had to currently replace 3/5 of the roster only revenge and Insanity are intended starts everyone else is. Not able to get into the country and play just yet so it's a tough luck but they brought in a bunch of the academy fixing to step up against the team already playing how it taste better than expectations that was already pretty good one easy look really really good yesterday and I do think they have the potential to be much better than the preseason equitation The Wharf and if we can step up because most people are looking at ignore as an upgrade and someone who's placed outfits better with did you get who wants to be aggressive ignorance is known for his wrongs known for his aggressive plays you look up to the top link Kumho vs. impact that seems like a clear upgrade as well but the main question people had was how is Def going to stack up to what thing was for a cheap because bang was huge and so many of the winds for EG out of def camera definitely an excuse me. That can be playing at a very high level you know as good as bang even been finished size limit for the steam they really could go pretty damn far is the team that was honestly have up the prettiest all of threat throughout most of the last year that they came freely close to going to Worlds I had some pretty good playoff runs over off and then yeah what is is leagues better than cumin to or three best supports in league and he's a big upgrade over Azazel there as well and then there's the shoes that you can be filled that belong to bang but if it two lanes are such big upgrades that I mean EGR legitimately a team that can challenge for the food for the throne to challenge for a trophy these the five players I can absolutely do it I'm excited to watch them play out here on the Immortals side of the player I ate and the biggest fan of is insanity I really liked what I saw of him last year getting thrown in and set me as best he could have a very very good player that Lucian mid is as well and yeah I think if you can keep doing well I think it's a it's a career that will keep watching with a lot of sort of excitement because I think he can he can keep getting better and he could be a star and a year or so yeah I definitely agree I'm in there there was so many games in summer split where Insanity was away from being this outstanding memorable game where there was a small Miss execution on the Shockwave for the over push on the azir attempt to try to just knock down the bass these small little moments but I like that he didn't lose his kind of killer Edge right because I do think that was something that that made him stand out is how aggressively he played to really get damaged out in the team fights he played a lot of really high DPS Champions know the carthus the Oriana the is here and he's not afraid to actually throw himself into the fight Stooges maximizes damage output you even if that means he's going to go down that can be worth it if you can get a tremendous amount of damage out so it seemed the development of insanity going to be a lot of fun I thinking already ate twice early on in this land against is UK and just in case is getting pretty darn Loi does have biscuits so we'll be able to start checking those motions but these traits are going very very bad at 4 You Jesus later so far so good and Santa to go to a concert with us when did you could just checking through the two regular potions the first biscuit comes in as well but that of course only does so much so what's it looking like it is for now though a possible formula for joules UK as the push comes into the trait down there nice sized up for Keith ignore walk set fros the hook but they're just out of range no pick up their perfect legs come in and they Siobhan down into this to her there as well as Joey and Keith's up again from the academy roster play as we have seen play in the LCS before but then we are seeing the Australian Duos the normal Stardust here for immortals and eventually we will have them but going to hold out as best they can't I certainly can be quite good and this is a game where I probably wouldn't like to see gale-force I think they're cracking noise when they want more tanks but you got like this game the ability to dodge some of these key engaged tools like Dodge out a hook potentially Dodges fear or sleeve coming through now that Kenny you really really big now there is quite a bit of poke over on EG but it's right I mean sometimes that sleep can just mean to kill and so when you have these p style compositions that want to try to poke you down and use the general for the engage are there is some pressure put over onto the engage tools that Immortal does having to take the primary engage there is going to be revenged we know how good gragas could be engaged or coming out of the Jungle same thing could be here for the Top Lane you can get even a lot more thank you we have been seeing just to relieve a full tank builds for the gragas top and I will see if that's going to be what he goes for the flash traffic now this is the cleanse out for the count for the Italian Stallion you happen to have on the roster again beautiful planet Zoe disaster for immortals though just gay punishing those mistakes Insanity flashing for was just barely out of Auto attack range you have to double-tap up so it would have been that first Blood over on his fence scary but he misjudged the rage and zouke make some pee and he is going to be so far ahead off of that going for the early Secrets here to just have that mitigation for the Laney face and he is going to be really really dangerous if he gets ahead we saw him and spring in particular really take over some games including some on the Zoe now where he was just Landing sleep after sleep poke after Pope and making it an absolute nightmare. Ford opponents in Taken 3 or damage to self with the Trap already down there and I sprayed all things that I've been having our houses are in region and he is basically out of potion so that's going to be tough and is down three Summoners there in a whole Summers off of eggnog and we can see this performance play hear back towards the midline insanity spotting since Karen on that Ward going over the wall and looking for the hill here just barely out of range not able to connect him then he's just a bit too far for the zoo KC the angle to make him pay picking up those Summers the first flash a line to get the kill and they pick up a second flash to get that second kill Joey looking for the engage here as potluck knows that we have no flash there's no getting out of it looks like they do down there he's got no mana and Keith is going to be attack is going to go down and show is going to follow for Kilz 2 nothing a flash Force the way to run away from the counter cake Evil Geniuses do wrong this nicely done answering that impact was so effective prevent also teepee tent but he didn't really have any man that he wasn't able to get his ultimate out or anything like that so easy end up coming out on top big-time in that bot Lane play definitely picking up a kill impact grabbing a kill for himself and the rich get richer yeah this is a pretty substantial to get write out 1500 already it's going to feel a bit dude every single Lane is winning the good cop it's not enough had to go in for the heck Splash and look towards a folino and he has no flash available but they're just now the lantern to come back up ignored able to get him out of there and then spent during his arrived impact has arrived impact getting back into that back line to standing up enough with that Q on three members of a mortal so then be able to flash out and survived and revenge just not as effective in that sell for play I didn't get to see exactly how the way was shaking out up on the top side but when you both, that TP your opponent gets the kill it's not going to be feeling too good
just got check to see if everyone's why we're going to draft into the first raptor games flights on Whose life skp on read and I have two questions for dress with the akali problem and how do they do with the Renekton problem to why is Katie took the right side of town is repeated if it was however I want to be heartbroken Pantheon it is flights which team is somero and its effectiveness of camping pool between multiple positions if you believe I can fly I can playeverything is really interesting that we just do the elite Ava normally people would take it back blade pain delete a file a complaint against him so much of this one of these best pick up and I love AP junglers on the Chiropractic to the Delta allow you to have so much more braided with your soul and other things to be such a high priority very threatening overall just seeing if I could take it right off the bat there of course of SIA already been the case already picked up and has really shown has been be Nautilus and the threat in the seems like a clear-cut often that you are picked to try at spider strategies and knows that she has a decent match of into trash however I think this would be the priority vehicle and KKexciting all the same spot like completely cracked open near Comfort pick to make sure that one of these guys can grab it there was an honest man and it looks like North Darren with the sacrificial lamb not get one of his Comfort Inn North Iroquois be playing on the back foot of whatever Champion he's able to grab out of 2nd and Pecos in that might still be a cashier for the Braven fan right there now with the gang click and we know it's going to try to cheat days is one of the chance that would have you been out you and I would like to eatpicked up just because they'll make me on the test they want to see a v e v competition coming at you get caught in the net day someone will fold down an incident necessarily want to run a tank so I think this might be a little bit of NJ Champion that could work at the Olive * if you see and a leased Russians Raven if you ever get wave management down there on sats the potential to set up a dog without a lease a really terrifying if you see the way. Katy from diving that it is very dangerous. That type of champion on top of the Gangplank ultimate if coffee is post level 6 answer right away hovering aroundtake me back to illusion so it does look like they are reserved in canopy how about another one of these flexes the sat in the States but if there is a good matchup might be able to take that one that what's the alarm Bells run off of North Tarrant, Warwick and volibear every single time for his longtime friend is not something that I expected Now you're scaring haven't been the best of his permit terms apply execution Champion you don't have to hit the hook but I would like him to hit some of them as much a plate in the bottom line already I think that I'm blitzcrank David also the additional range of blood prankscan actually set up a lot of making plays over maybe then I suspect it might be willing to go to something like letendre despite the fact that he's having quite a few shows that I recognize the lack of engage they needed to Safeway to be able to play for backing up and taking a look at the SATs composition visicom that really thrives on 1 and 2 item power cycle this is the consequence snowball and cowardice especially well it's actually they ever get priority controls at Midway and start involving Faker in the silence which he's on the sondre in here because you talked about being able to roam over but you got types of Blitz having a battle against Ravens and undercurrent if you want to blaze out comes downon the road welcome to summoner's Rift for the first quarterfinal match of the day underdogs of put splice the third team out of Europe congrats for making the world huge bras for getting out of the group but you are up against a the best team in the world and SK Telecom T1 the Juggernaut to South Korea the lck Champions three-time World Champion make it to yet another world semifinal and level 1 Shenanigans I'm not going to pay off and that means are we going to have a very standard early game we speak about this a lot but if sat to have the same composition 122 Wadhams I do want to have a good early game burden is on Thursday on the side of splice to be able to do his thing this is a jongleur that European analyst speaks so highly of because when he does come on top of the drift he's able to control the state of the game trinket reset and now has a sweeper and on gragas yes you can go for a full clear and then grab your Predator boots between your top side and bought side jungle but you can also look for early level 2 Gang by using that sweeper and denying Vision on the other side though he's against Clay probably be best jungler in my opinion at this tournament and so vital to bridging SKT from early to mid game of the tournament most people have played as novel one right now and I think that I'll be very interested to see how he plays his early again cuz we seen a lot of a lease and I think at least into current champions in the jungle is actually quite good too scary shows that Alicia's able to meet to say on in the only game I would expect to be pretty Elise David So if I will see you when that is going to be the case I do want to mention this middle a match up one more time I know that you mentioned that this is a flame that we've seen historically we did stop seeing a little bit because the cooldown went off on lissandra away play what kind of shot a little bit and have become incredibly High did they shoot be a lame that humanoid as long as he is able to trade well and set up games free jungle with very good Wave Control the other winning match at Fred's Hayti is Converses chalky up there we know that Lucien is a great counterpick into a dangling because of how we can deal with the barrels on his passive double shot or two DoubleTap there and is also the potential of a possible. I've skating place are punished all the time globally not necessarily in the LEC until they think they can Coast through a lot of people ain't and get to that big Bank Plank moment you can see clear on the way pigs when you're with Annalise you need to respect the potential to Dive Right Now Tri-Cities visitor it pretty close to HP the papers already Adeline 3 minutes today's order for the tops of the courthouse in place down does spotting look at these red vinegar to look at the farm that talk to you is not allowed to get in range for the evolution of SKT to MSI has been fascinating to track at that tournament first to fight in the bottom softener you'll be punished if they don't have the proper support be set up was there's a path from top to bottom side because that's where the kill pressure is face think that Chachi can just throw up the brick walls but as Haiti come slamming through and you can see right now that Chucky is just trying to survive as long as possible pick up as much pain he knows he's going down with actually the play on the flip side of the map 3 summoning spells that Splash to be able to go for but I want to just throw it back to what I was saying sat vs. G2 fake app freezing the lane on the as is and cats taking over the entirety of the map of MSI this time it's the only reason he's trying to get himself a favorable shop NCS late and take us just pieces out of the lane impact somewhere else I would have went out what the actual result was no because it's 3704 splice two three bench press Katie just in the bottle dive in figures with a full minute Top Lane in the midst vs is equal all that time spent answer is a kill and has no difference in it I shouldn't feel good right now nothing nothing actually happened four slices is the only problem there this is what happens when your players are pound-for-pound veteran situation that should favour you just means you caught up with what the game was the lck consistency of taking their moment. Timers Wave Control up visiongain they're so disappointed it means that they don't expose himself to mistakes and I get to punish yours absolutely and I think that the difference of this sat lineup on the international stage is it also a little bit more willing than we've seen in the past that throw down early they will take some more of those 5 second wind chill for a minute has certainly shut up and so far is Worlds you can just see they are way more active on summoner's Rift idea that in the lck domestically since there's a higher Baseline of fundamentals team can recognize stronger so they going to try and push it in this most of the time we just made no secret of the phrase however I cannot find a way to leave put in a bit of damage but God is going to get a second kill the game and a play like this is just so rough to watch because it would have more than one member coming up to try and break that breed an epic opportunities like this on the international stage to punish inexperience came out of apartment so it is going to be holding against Chachi to get this to bounce into the wave but as he read it say not yet they killed him they continue to snowball I mean and it's just so many things that you would question about this play the fact that Chachi had telephoned available that he could have come back with items and now it's not going to stop doing suppose but they might have changed over the road. Lucia you have no flash the way it is frozen again see right now you're just being hard tonight and it's at least it's just setting up shop in your land this is freedom health gone this is the ultimate feels bad moment I think they caught it level 6 can melee kill him whenever you want so this is a nice to have right now. I think that this is an area of SKT the people bought my faves political, on the international stage certainly had some pretty acrylics out that was at the health to be clear right it isn't a 3-minute dive over at level three and then you know clicks but he wants out of here as well but hey if you spend the time results come in maybe that's a good job he got the kills if you're looking from splices lens what can I help get back on the map to make it worth the fact that it is Itachi and she's in the grave right now he's trying to dig himself out which you have to make something crack on the bottom line or in the midline is a split math happening right now she really cheating out of the mid lane as well admit him and they will be able to take the entirety of the Jungle but looks like they want the time flashing still gone get City bottle by throat they're going to look for the hook and effort kites back and looking like reports are coming over there as we've got to take her right to the river with a route to buy some extra time with enough time time for round to walk away old lost a very well play from FHA they even prevent preserve fake is black and a lot of that is the fact that shot speak no evil see no teleport available where is condyles have it so that you would say wet pasta Torrid time would be time will be able to teleport down there just is so strong right now on this week that was pretty hot to get something to put on two different ones and they haven't gotten
this is outside optimal lineup so just going to have to run around you know we call a Subaru in Australia that 35 year olds play football maybe so but why am I from twice as productive if they don't win the series but I was given the opportunity to take you are going to pull out the crazy takes the crazy strategies this is where the fuck is your moment right that's also very interesting to see what had been choosing a lot betteror the tank would certainly fit in his wheelhouse and I'm just curious what his answer is going to be or he's going to go back towards his legendary coffee and try to neutralize this way it will be ultimately decided by a bottom line cuz why not to take something like a gangplank right and be able to add utility do I match up the Gangplank talked to playing to Renekton but limit the ability to be able to give me an option to be able to fly through every now heading to secondary phase of Van Dyke SKT to put the pinch on their stay here with his champion pool particularly doing 80 junglers because he is already lookingdid AP bit later with that rice or something like a Zoloft maybe even do not turn it to been locked in for both teams has that people right now but diversify damage portfolio is a great case to be made right now given the fact that you're going to have the hottest CT coming out of the jungle on classes line up there probably Lane fine into a ride and ride doesn't have a dash to be able to get himself out of Harm's Way and we've seen how much damage does Champion tattooing States has a matchups I think it was going to be played atKendra and 1/2 musli ran away with a gangsta cover pic in that jungle there he does want to go towards something like you do off and it's more so about finding the matchup for the Renekton surprised that you sent a good match up one of these best champion in the least bitI need to be honest I kind of would expect to see that one coming through at all times he's very very cool as there is going to come through that we have seen as your top as well as expected give them good priority and pushing we've already talked about the long-range being able to take someone a little bit more chill right also the fact that it's one of those Champions that tells the cattle go to the options the kind that has in the early stages famous for saying that he will not play this game until he feels like he is back in form of when the state was created so I think that that is certainly something I do not expect that's why you don't do when he was playing in the elf DLC also didn't play it when you returned vltk Martha is one of those players that is so incredibly proud of the lineage that that Samsung white line up had you know some still date play the river pigeon control at that will Champion shipping from Malta you know that's a lot to I'd be very surprised to see it International wins you just off a quarter past the big 100 the next closest player toothaker I believe we will be at 55 no longer at the tournament and then behind him somewhere in the 40s or guys like perks that is how dominant figure has been 02 International results but the games are played for a reason and I'm curious what gets played in this one skinwise and how it comes out cuz there's something telling about that every once in awhile it looks like oh it is I don't want to wear this until like I feel like I'm deserving of that level of skill again that's just such a great call out this is going to be a really special moment for League of Legends fan because he's also crucial towards a composition I want to see the coordination with clit engagements in League of Legends honestly legendary do us any North American fans about when he played on R&G at MSI in the amount of backline. On the alista he's just always being one of those highlight-reel players go back at Worlds at Katy no shock there either he's pushed back a little bit but, then again looking to the flip side across from splice they've been so hungry for so long to get ready to talk to you and Thursday in particular have been denied so many world births before so this summer on on the wreck site and the or the counter match of that we were talking about into Renekton I don't say counter mashup making sure you don't buy Renekton repeatedly as she has had a massive Target on his back this entire series and I do like to talk himself up with that access to minions in can get so I'm quite easily said a lot of heavy trading however it is going to be the right side that is much closer to the Lane one of the reasons you can do this when you're playing at the right side is does need level Fraser really be able to impact good gang names that tunnel to be able to get into I don't expect anything to come up here until he has completely steer applicants will be on a timer we talked about this all the time now we see it's about 4:30 for 35 with us second rotation cruggs which means on the next rotation of crowd if Colin is press forward, and needs to respect the fact that Thursday will be on play the map and potentially look for a bank around the five-minute window on top but I think that's because I will start to bounce back to work and obviously if you could High to pay Advantage as Khan looks like he does he's been through all the corrupting What charges a from Chachi meet the teacher be able to control that maybe set up a meeting for eighth from South and deny that if I ever took the potion said he himself actually as well as they could be pushing around and tries to be nice and farm from humanoid there's anybody in the wings though the gangster mid lane quite interested in fact Mayweather flash flash flash to mid-length have a look at the jungle impact still being available spaces something like it's gonna snow at Lee going to be in favor of them has a really important when do we were just talking about the balance for top-line but also for Mid laner particular why she doesn't get to really love you take it and how strong he can be with his spoke with his his way for so like ganking azir before level 5 we're really his way up there just because uncontrollable on that first back then you can try to slow down how much does a zero can take over the game and really protect his jungle because he always has Midland priority so that was the one window or splice got it yeah it didn't mean to kill but they need to follow up and try to abuse the fact that we should just have to, priority for a bit and has to respect not playing with lash the wave is pushing towards bake or so we can let people can needs to charge me to last out of the turret a very deep self off of that can be spotted by the sky is blue this time around though he can still see the truck camper when it comes up in about 30 seconds and play around that 4 minutes a five-minute window so he's going to get eyes on it you can also see that played popping in making sure he's checking for vision to Concan continue to play aggressive up in that top died and I'm really interested in the fact that twice played MIss Raven Lane has a weak-side they just using it as a slow scaling answer they say Draven if you don't dive and he's going to just be able to farm pretty freely in this Lane going to continue to build a few sacks and we will get him a kill in the mid game and then he's going to be able to take over don't like they throwing additional resources down to Teddy I do want to point out the brilliant thing that are observers just showed us hear the fact that they're safe sweeper but missed both of these crucial Ward so this is something that when reviewing the tape again that pay teens will have to be aware of where they are fleeting their Ward because it's not usually where you would expect it to be a sweeper Mystic very well done from fac on Division ways to be put in the beginnings of a glacial shroud coming through for the orange trying to survive on a tour if you can see at NCS different claim with graphs you can out of the turret there but it's an early lead for calling up there is it takes another look at Aspire take that one over humanoid going to keep his word of life that's good that's a long cool down 10 gold given over Vision lost and play it across the control word has a lot of a jungle and a lot of this game is going to come down to how long can SKT can maintain this vision control continue to farm and get to Walters item Palace by because I do feel like it can be a fairly active early game from splice you know you have things like the rise rexha I called both rise as well as something like the naughty list and also set up really strong gangs and if you stop defense Spells at level six. You can't really look for those pamphlets as well we tell the boys coming through from people like Joshy so I do think that would be very content with the pace of the game right now you know obviously would love to be able to pick up the first infernal Dragon of the game when you're running black as if it is just such an attractive prize but don't feel like they will be in such a rush to be able to go to that one that we expect kind of the big explosion point on this map to be around the bot Lane because they are playing for such a crucial objective so we're waiting for the level 6 is to come in and he teleports to be available Chachi using his just get back with the land there's no window Works SKT could try to abuse the teleport decent clear protectant where is he doesn't feel like I do like her Showbiz did it's not just like oh well it's not going to take it fits good for lunch bites which one you think it take so long fights would like to use the full like 10-15 seconds of shojin Bob Evans comes off and kill the guy that way so she with with anti-tank play hold on. Grinch you're coming through too much damage and first finger and Katie from the priority that Congress had all game long on the top side it gives him ROM priority the ability to First be the person to move and yeah humanoid helps with his Midland priority secure that infernal but because he was over the infernal Faker than built up a slow crash the way fraction to the wave and it gave so much time to SKT just walk in with skarner nekton should have been able to try for one wave and then allowed to regain control of mid-length with humanoid that wasn't the case it was a rush play you can say that lid now has access to that helped by Jaco my look for what they should throw you over this. I'm going to go for a starter the primary target Delano campus party will affect our place and surpassing apple is halfway to start to grow Elite glass with perfect binding shut it down punishment having a place outside let's take another look at this one is available on this life I had none from f82 they would both use on that midlane drive against humanoid once again it was a greedy overrated and Chachi
ain't nobody bringing SKT downtown downtown they fell in game 3 they bring enough monkeying around they got to close this. Yeah they do leave it up more for the Ali still maybe but not important things like puppies still available means that I think that is enough to be able to justify changing the priority in the drop right now to arrive in the priority on the rice keep in mind you're not having very strong games and games in both games was in the rise. Baker a bit more let's take that for ourselves play Fast and Furious through this song coming out right now to come out this is really putting splice for the test on there can't be a correct match ups when are Thalia is it going to make it better I think there is a genuine 1% true that if you are able to flashing at the Impala stunt into an immediate like however that means a lot of this game is going to be about the top of the map and what we've seen so far is it splashes able to make it about North Kern and call bags and the ability to teamfight as looks like they are having most except so I think that this drop so Bob would be pleasing at 1810 North Sharon still does have that with Kranks available if it falls through the draft face I really like the look that North Karen was giving on that I can get with Kai next best performance alongside that Nautilus last events come out twice must complete the reverse week they got two more to do drop in the blitzcrank down as well as exacting trash has beef with effort download it brother the champion tool but if you are sat right now you can remove that all right you have lost band coming out of that page you can really live in it and if you are feeling incredibly I guess you know it support brackets that go into the bottom line you know something that would be able to pick up and had children at 10 already at well so I think the area is now that's why I still look in the pic that answers that I have to take pick up phone I do expect it to be a support pick so they can kind of get more information 590 there instead going to send that bring up into the waiting arms of Quinn as well and what would I do believe they're going to be how far down the ladder is he going to go to find something I mean other possible support that have been banned at a lot this tournament or things like that are still available yeah what would make the match up a little bit more bearable yes please now by picking up. Here it also means that if North Darren goes towards something like a palm Kent that you can punish it more just because you can stack in the syringe and then pull it going to go to this one here seen it a hundred percent going to be open say that would be the toughest matchup of everything we've listed so far so I think that this is an area that they would be really comfortable to have landed in inches going to be hot and fresh down there in the bottom line however the tools now fit and Katie I actually much more heavily in that 131 split up the map try and drag black around and if we going to win some of these games team fighting in through making the game simple sat was a very good answer now and I'll pull the game there's no on this time around there's no Camille in the mid lane and should not inhumanoids up so he found gate number 232 have a very good matchup I really like Cinder into the ride ride I feel like without the guarantee that has to go through through animation kind of looks him in place in Sanford right back damaged really nicely in that midlane play very heavily into the wave as well so I think that's in the area if you really he's going to continue to play while he's going to go back there for a picture of dragons Rise right there so I agree with you kind of been the one V one not two but I think when you start including some of these jugglers it can go either way but it's about what connecting there because quite devastating all these lames guaranteed La Quinta mid back pain third play of the Year might be a lot of pressure on up there my eyes remain on top of those kids prices so good they're best performer in my opinion right now again on the rip open it close it out with that wedding know they can strike again and I feel like early jungle popping has held so much play over how the series has gone I'm going to say now on the Thalia special ability to be able to walk in topside jungle and split the map Thalia level 1 is so incredibly strong at being able to force into jungle say where they doing it looks like just a standard fan I feel like it's split map right now would really suit Chachi he would love for that to be able to come through it's about with a splice take the risk and while we are focusing in on the top light to cleanse and not having access to the teepee obviously makes sense when you have such high Mobility on a champion like when she's not as reliant on teleport as other top laners but certainly respecting how much kills what can be up here across until you're acting a little bit even more than respect because he's also gone away from press the attack which is going to be the major K Starr normally that you see taken on something like Quinn so there you are that he can just die in a single combo yeah the way to the work of the combat pattern is instead of fun chunking for 3 and backing out its land 3 and then chase down the Renekton humise now faster than this supports quite nice a lake in Baton the blue bypass can be stolen I'm very scared I hope she normally a champion in his wheelhouse that we really expect from Chachi this year the wave was going to get some depth of the temperature for Chachi and Khan doesn't have an easy way out. Finally just go to space and it's what does 1x however this is so dangerous, believes this isn't going towards the top side of the Mask wanted to covering humanoid I need protection from the way of again they spotted out Khalid on some visions of a new that there was a potential the level to gain Clinton now bottom mod is working is it a flashlight come out early game he can take it very aware that he needs to have an impact early we already mentioned the jungle is a holding a lot of sway however I do feel like it's being able to Zone, love so much experience and go to this is going to ultimately be a triple bond and when you swap notes for kids I think a very so literally game so far from splice is the recipe for success for splicing all of the early games we say all the time we have to drive at home Thursday is so important to the team and Ani Champion that can jungle so quickly like to lie if that is so much movement around the month it is really about controlling the pace of the game figuring out where people are in just making sure that Cersei is constantly forced to the punch call me when you got to pushing up in the topside Chachi every time he Auto should pick one and returned from a wear him down so far is held on to his health potion no just use the door in Shield lap anybody can yeah he's down 10 CS holding on so fast me Big Damn it to the sexy a lot at the heavy chunks in every trade it back on 200 hp turn active and you feel like that is at a minimum going to be a Teleport back into the lane and, therefore justifies the use of the Clans as a summer to spell already in this game set up a flight and the setup was a beautiful from splice at first but then of course I'm not connecting with these weather Bali right there me to take a look at the water softener not going to take too much damage back supposed to hit at that you do arrange disadvantaged so whenever you see those trains coming across from SKT just be very mindful of who Teddy is heating this is who called a thief. Attack looking now at me upside the attempt it's done for Chachi he'll be in range of how it's going to build a lot of space and it's called trying to run away not if he's going to keep running but gets out just in over for Stan from splice getting the flash out of Chachi you can see what is a kennel allow the way without teleport to be in this position so they should be opportunities and once again look for a fight pretty far up is a map of the rays do to get a very fixed on it going to be with their kind of back-and-forth Lottery, stay alive, get the recall but none is not going to be level 6 yet so cannot take the bird back to Lane note to try to get the fries you might just make it around the side of the week and this is repeatedly what flights are going to try to do what they need to make these Hills. Connecting away from the easiest having to burn this I'm going to spell very nice platform clown with a cleanse and as soon as you don't initially killed a rain check they just get all of the advantages in the chase able to turn around so much damage the recall comes through pain now has the cutlet has extra proper tool to deliver an extra little spell that will help turn on phaiser to be needs it in the slow helps of course as well get to get 600 gold different that's what you get from a first-blood long has insisted that he cool game all other things considered Top Lane Farmers in 5 level 6 in perspective as well there's a small window we're actually Chachi my people to brutalize them we want and it gets going to be missing in favor of humanoid he hasn't the teleport back to the wave and fakir is hitting in about 10 PS describe it to you once he's going to be collected from humanoid so once again slices rookie me latest Epping up on the biggest the biggest name in League of Legends and having a very good early again so crash here from splice means that there's a potential for a Dodge their Cesar next snow flash either that's going to be a really nice lead time fault but it's still Farm tonight is going to be a flight to Chachi it going to be is Brompton is Katie answer with air pressure on towards the fertile trait to the question how much is Con Lussier cuz he's out of the way if he's out of the turret knocks it down get most of that farm in fraud rate for half away if that's a good thing for SKT yeah I really like to trade coming out from SKT right now they know that this is going to be a big area of pressure topside how is it now thinking not really hovering Up Akon has to be able to trim the wave and we'll be able to do it successfully so so much time invested from Splash at least nothing until play with access to his bird is playing this very safely knowing is there a things going to try for the blue box Mike that's going to be just in time there was just barely space for y'all to come through tonight just to make sure I have enough damage at Freddy's going to drop in the rain gauge comes across humanoid but that Tower diapers into a disaster for a credit instantly on the teleport did not waste a single beef series and again Khan has pushed in this way if it is frozen again soon he is being very stubborn and trying to chip out Chachi Pitzer say it's just continually providing cover. Lena and that's why Quinn top is so scary that you bought the W every 40 seconds you'll have a jungle raised here I know how to play this is Bitcoin going to be worth it compared to just be synced there from multiple members of SKT going back to the Queen Question she's not really getting any sizable Advantage because there's a and Josh ER
how much more manageable upon it and golden Guardians Champion across top reason so far dispatch most pick the band overall 90% number one in Pro play so no big deal Pantheon outstanding rules right now I'm sure as well but support so easy ban there as well and we can finish Jet-Dry guess is someone who has popped up a lot in the medit to but it's more for top light which is kind of thing I've been seeing a lot of toppling gragas around the world these days. So that pic also pretty high in priority and math a lot of people are really loving other kind of comment build where you can just poke away with Ian, very dominant and Lane just with all those guaranteed poking her ass that you can landed obviously very powerful team fight with theultimate I'm so pretty high priority on I'm really all of these campion's I do feel like the later bands are more where it's kind of just up to you what you are most worried about is it something specifically from the opposing team college is one of those band champions in the world though I was checking you know a day or two ago on actual battery that it had one picking Pro Flay and something like 4849 vans so this is not really getting through another regions pretty much at all seals you will be given it it is potentially flexible mostly it is still played in Midland from what I see you in solo queue but obviously can't go to topI'll see what comes through regardless of course in the European piano Loft and lie there good band as well as he got to choose there are lots of good Champion right like 40 something very very very strong and did you got to figure out which one's going to play games with once you are not Kaiser Graves is also what they bargained with said okay you might lock in the colony but that gives us first flash on a bot Lane first glance at it at 8 on here as well as a gym rat came through and of course very straight talk to her as well or really affect American up and stop playing so it only made things even more likely has been outstanding hand so much trouble in killing tanks and we'll see those to get locked in at some point for gold yeah exactly you know that they may go towards that but he always see have a lot of squishy campion's in his first round picks year for Golden Gardens at gin can look towards engine does have absolutelywilber's especially when you are playing from ahead it could be pretty difficult to deal with the gym 21 season itemization setting has really helped Jen especially things like The Collector that are offering both credit and lethality which gin just absolutely loves a has made I think a pretty big difference gale-force can help with some of the mobility issues that Jen has a line to chase down and get that for shot off in a situation that you might not have otherwise been able to and I also feel like you know when your parents in with other heavy for him is like the akali energy there because they both have pretty heavy out front damage that can help to move towards in that fourth shot excuse to call ER to execute will see if they're gonna be able to pull off this sort of style of fighting because I do think that it is more difficult than your standard front to back couple tanks in the front line is this is kind of more skirmishes you were looking for flanks and we'll see if they do bring in some engage from the jungle and before to try to make starting price will be easieryeah we did see a little while back there with his impact on Evil Geniuses doing a really good job having the Renekton plank to be the primary in gate and that was enough but I really have to get in there and think we were in the medicane wherever in love playing things like Leona Alistair and Ralph are you expecting to get in at some point to Leah and Italy the bands by the way on the golden Guardian side expecting toppling to be a focus get rid of the most common magic Damage Done Rouge that would complement connecting very well meanwhile Niles he's a Giza carry play do you want to play something slow to respond and so Gangplank is going to be a lock it that you can ignore gameplay but can you still there to be a damage dealer and he is still there to do I participate you know it on that site and still have no front line and a really good idea so far for the engage I'm expecting that will get some sort of report for their last pick is what I would assume and then you can have set up swear to me you dropped a GP Altman on them your support goes for try to look for some sort of engaged are in a GP also you can answer the Renekton Point Quick Stopno orange out of that hopefully avoid any sort of combo from the jungler that we've been seeing if it's in a lot of an act in Tulia Ivermectin did Ali was very popular last year these has accomplished can be pretty frightening but said you want to give me coming in sociology composition with more Frontline how this does give them some engaged as well obviously the stage 1 alternate can sometimes be a bit unreliable but you know that he's very reliable can be sometimes nicer to use that text when you open it as a follow-up out of her methods that are out of the initial engaged up from the house so I can guarantee that it's not going to be dashed out of avoided new with something like a case of ultimate to round things out for CLG but they're relatively short-range Steve over all this is a team that wants to fight that wants us grab five different angles to get those engages and really knocked down golden Guardian to her looking to draft something that they feel a lot more kite and it with the galley or coming in your galio is more follow-up engage or counter and Gagethen he is at the primary in case I guess you can flag and try to talk but you can just get headbutt out by the Alistar that's not as reliable as something like a Leona or or even the Alex are himself so Golden Gardens it feels more like they're going to be trying too tight and disengage from Sea algae and try to win that longer extended fight going to play the map is openly as they can for them are Kaiser in a Galileo can get in from pretty far away Odyssey GP old from anywhere on the map PDF as most men trained as well so you're right that conventional gauge is going to be tough you can t f into the back line with Kaylee over top and that can kind of work but that's not really the look it feels like a a split push every team the problem is who's going to answer connected pretty well because off of ruined King PlusGorge maker like it's going to it's going to be tough to win the what do you want I feel like as GP but we'll see how it goes we'll see what the hell does it look like here for Golden Guardian as if they are rosters going to have their first game of the year and 6 in his first day of off of CLG likely saw his old teammates lose to Team Liquid not long ago since it's a bunch of groups of the five teams to look at a play twice in a five-game day it is sealed restaurant the day someone else will do it tomorrow and now look at to see what these players can show for us CLG lost to the best team in the league likely every other team elusive TL as well this one is timer supposed to shake back up and take down gold Guardians if they want to keep themselves happy and I think the answer you know as to who's going to answer the Renekton it is just going to be probably Niles but not necessarily trying to fight him or kill him just try to wave clear right now we can see Golden Gardens looking for a potential late invade I may be just going to go toward down here from nuviva decided his back it up I'm not even going to go for that because he wants toget to a certain point as long as you're not getting Dover you're way behind your wave hair becomes very very effective and it can be difficult to dive GP from that situation especially if he does go for a little bit more and he build a bit more of a defensive build early on sometimes we will see people you know just do things like picking up a little bit of HP Lewis and Ruby crystals and things are really on to it to make sure that they're not just going to get completely obliterated in a diving if I'll can do that hold on there I've been there's the possibility of a blaze Olive playing the other side of the map as you said get out until at 131 have new be responding to both sides potential ETF as well as that Galileo coming in and trying to pick on those side lanes and maybe getting out of bedthat's all talk cannot catch the second wave of the Guardians been get pretty reliably so you got the back up pretty soon because we can walk at you you forward and then go for the tonsils supposed to play out of rain for their safe against that you can see audio tour is is that rain so there I believe might have to drop one Cs and the day is not going to be a big deal at Blaze all look at the early push and it gets pulled out there cuz I can't walk Centex auto back as wellnot too bad I'm going to be pretty into the sea where pobelter takes us as well as far as itemization does go the more common build is the wrif maker but I feel like my Harvester is often more effective as if you are having those long extended flights to sustain from The Ref maker can be pretty powerful you do see people tearing that up a lot of times with something like demonic Embrace in Spanish this warlike pseudocyst a knee Tanki longer fight style but I tend to feel like when I see people just going night Harvester and you didn't Lich Bane in the more aggressive Versi style of bills those can be really really powerful and especially against a lot of squishy members over on Golden Guardians I tend to feel like that would make more sense this gameyeah I'm actually a big fan of ours are they get so incredibly underrated Mage Mythic even even so far as to say you don't have to go to lose every game you can just go to my Harvester Rangers manager Amanda better and you know we are sooner and I could be released want me to go about things also nice in the season is Lich Bane Batman on it so you could feel a lot better but I don't feel like you're wasting money on you know exist on that recipe anymore Guardians a very small gold lead over all the squats without just Twisted Fate and Gangplank exist so doesn't really mean much just yet equally likely to be up there but not doing too much overall freighter blows across the 80 carries you could see that they're all trying to stay far away from the gate before the tanks in the brush to make sure you're out of range of their stuff to make a little bit about those kind of non man items in one of the Champions that we do see actually going for a 9mm an item a lot of time is tftf off and going for the hextech rocket belt you just helping4th utility the engagement all the dashboard perhaps land that gold card little bit more easily easily with the additional many get back from Luke Harding you don't always need more of that place. We're looking to push and reset constantly anyway so you don't always need the additional to stain from a lost chapter a style of item so we'll be cool to see where I played all of does go you can also go for inmate Harvester in those is heavy first style of build on PS4 Pro play I don't really think we'll see it and even so look you it's a lot less commonI'm going to go see golden Guardians do a lane to take me a second to see 6 a.m. and not say CLG so if you excuse me if I get that wrong when I once or twice this game I'm going to be a little bit so the backside of a canal fight match up against the best top laner that's ever spoken English maybe to be clear to shove it away because it take a very aggressive recalled because of it tracks the graves knows he's far takes the way between the two rights and get to walk back that's always a good feeling need to walk back to Lane about missing a speedswitch to another small gold lead to Golden Gardens Ablaze all of teepees. There's like I saw the way over as well but their spots it no place okay in the end still pretty darn good for Golden Guardians they end up getting the trait of teepees it is first Blood just barely going over 6/8 not going to get those who will be able to pick up that way then I'm on the top side miles is going to farming away here now looking to poke but the all intestine coming from Orange is the Pharaoh could mean a lot that was supposed to walk awaystop playing he's going to find Solo solo showing up big it looks like you messed up in a slice and dice again we see a blaze on popping the all that you're picking on no Renekton is gone but with that ultimate up he is very tanky and he's able to just stay alive they're turning around and killing off Niles who went to bar hopping the infamous solo about their that's his favorite for sure the camping icon really nice place for him to come to your land of fight what was Camp I mean really just this but what if you want to find a cap at 6 Ace going back to his tell me a ghost startthat's the thing you learn about League of Legends never a fair fight you know these people are always calling their junk there is over, mid laners whatever happened to an audible game of League of Legends beautiful soaps it going to Gold Leaf not bad for CLG ocean Drake claimed as well look who's the mythical Beast takes down Dragon parent Lisa Hart County who would have known but it's nice to see it or get them in early okay look you got to have the starter I've only got so many options to cash Griffin you on the I respected I respect it thanks no problem all right it was pretty important topside honestly because you do fall behind you pee in a melee matchup you can't get a fused back down to that for earlier play here smoothie looking for The Flash in Punjabi with the early flash get out on the other side in the middlehot out there but iconic was passing down and now back to live your up on the top side so little trouble here yeah he missed the barrel to have a smoothie nearby as well water debate it might go to find that but there's some nice honey proof stop playing so we're going to feel comfortable enough still has his 10c asleep still has his Kilt can we doing just fine up there is a griffin takes down a blue
why don't you pick something on the right side and I'm just so curious about spring that go to snow much Invictus gaming in Spring they said they have site selection and game on Beto's red side so far in group stayed undefeated on the red side as well that means the shy less likely to get one of those big counterpick to really blow sort out of the waterediting thing that the JCPenney here that was its pies para swords most played Champions certainly a great this I staple as well but you are hurting I can't deal with this and that that's fascinating be other bottomland if they're keeping open know would be Guerin you me and when we were watching the Shona tahm kench vs. Garen Yumi Griffin versus Cloud9 game I was fairly convinced that the Stono would technically be accounted for that but that's sort of an actually to me says Griffin might be willing to go Gary Union game on this is what kind of what I was thinking maybe the one V one I think Kobe rookie and Anna but regardless they haven't already put that can get itthey were playing last night in other, but I've already been very down at Worlds recently especially in the outside possibility there's more to this Lulu pick than first meets the eye another things that some teams have done against Karen Huger which now has confirmed with locked-in is picking more of a hyper carry bottom of do I can see them trying to pair up an Ardent censer Lulu with either of Bane or kog'maw or at even a twitch or something that could be very powerful later in the game and Korea vein was definitely play The Lacsbut to be fair if caixa is up above all other every single one not if he's in the game is the number one scariest camp for us we are removing that everything else is fine or later here I do have one final thing I do remember is Draven idalia a different style of champion from the van when it comes to what is against Draven but it is notable that is ultra Comfort is left open and this is also because you're probably going to be a Kianna mid-length rookie in the group and even though the block is Bandit does Lee Griffin open for potentially a last pick counter for Midlandokay Griffin are going to leave made up for Last Frontier flight restored it was looking around that I get the play part of your so far at all world going to play are we should have already talked to you a bit of a safer Champion overall I think this guy is a stronger top later and play something. What are you up to I can't be Pueblo. Matchups are less than the Price Chopper on to the roster as Todd comes and talks irrelevant a time that's a historic match up with the ability to see if I can find some other for a long time all right yeah watching Griffin try and find fight in Chuck Rodriguez Lulu Kiana Aldi's all of its threat in front of them and safely well the new Champion out of the rest of the Crock-Pot in the bottom Lane meanwhile welcome to summoner's Rift per game 1 of the quarterfinals Invictus gaming are defending their world championship against one of the best teams has her has ever received the number to Maria play so well to get the top seed here they drew IG and multiple expect three wins this one and went at top speed they chose the red side and have definitely gone down the counter picking rabbit hole but are there is about here is the to get the counter picks in the lane matchups they want they have sacrificed traditional damage when you think of what a mid to late game team fight looks like for the poppy in the middle and I'm liable for damage might be the highest and then no one else really trailing her so because of that it feels like the only Dominican execution with was on point from Griffin a few days ago it's all going to have to be really closely inspect I think so and also when were looking across counter picks there's a lot of very interesting stuff happening so I feel like the general team comp by Griffin counters Kiana because there's not a good Target for Kiana to actually find any type of assassination on normally it's get your lasala go to go to hit a squishy Target Dory squishy Target actually don't exist you mean on targetable and Elise can also Josh things with repel so there should be no one but rookie can find assassinations on you on the flip side you have a bunch of people with high MaxHealth the kog'maw with lethal Tempo will be able to stretch through throughout the game show hitting the proper time Windows is going to be very important I do all this shouldn't be no surprise when call Moe's in the game it really is does Griffin Trivia Live cam Osteen buy them back at the start of a fight or discount mall do right now really pushed into the bottom Lane were looking to the mid laners some Farm is a rookie so far doing pretty well on CS might have to drop to the cast of Indians on the trail put so far so good over there and then got a pretty heavy leash on the blue buff there did the full left side clear make his way down to the bottom of jungle at least one very similar things in the north jungle Atlanta map here already Vision missions done by gryffin to open things up topside stop by at least not necessarily anticipating some outside to make sure that we can't get punished super early on into the game since yeah they are just going to be pushed in early be interested to see if you try to do anything Reddit actually going to be very difficult to gain show he has no reason to ever use his W preemptively in can just really wait for broadcast to go in and if they ever try and get him when she Asian I think you just rock is Aftershock that way and become very tank should be fairly comfortable pushing up and laying here it was about two guys because he is but he's a little bit jumped in. Granite so there is some degree of trade and going on for the actively there and I was about to Scuttle comes over to dig when I can have much aggression dungeon the bottom side Elites Renekton in this lollipop video. Going to see in the middle and very much for the Sun hits if you stand next to a wall at the least it's a coon the follow-up is insane and Poppy does have a lot of face first damage if she's planning her full rotations I think that's kind of 8 that have potentially road with its walls up you're not going to get you in that so sickly walks backwards should have seen the mid laner come in as well to there where that timing thing could go back in the late is he I believe he was recalling on the war with his I'm really game cuz he doesn't have anything up on the map reasonably right now to do his plugs will be up shortly so until then he's actually just going to kind of hang up hang out up here and interesting how we actually misses the sweep even though it was fairly obvious they walked over toward if I have some stats hear from that for games at Griffin played last week on a second round robin the kill death ratio on the right side is so impressive a 7.3 Kilts for every death incurred I went and looked at that I actually asked has there ever been a better day of best of one play than what we saw from Griffin earlier this time that the answer was actually know it was probably the most impressive statistical and I test all time Griffin would be ranked third if you noticed the two teams above them did end up winning a world championship so kill death ratio is by no means the be-all-and-end-all of who will win world but Griffin group stage in contact with very impressive Now take me back to the topside Tarzan has continued to stay up here as the replicant has come back up hoping to find something on the side has been playing for the aggressively filters very large Siesta lead on the Oswell that's the kind of paper looking for I can't come up here at least have to get the farm on a lot of containment done by gryffin so far but the game really does pivot when Boots of Mobility a done it wasn't no snowball kill and we know that's very likely on the way if they can keep River control on both sides here then we won't see a return to form of rookie who was really dumb it in the silence against TL so effortlessly and I also have to say that the bottom Lane of is it necessarily expected to win early there expected to then turn on kind of want unique guest rewards this early game is going to be about Griffin stopping the bleeding as much as possible and they're not necessarily doing that very well in the Top Lane and it'll be very fun to track how powerful jackeylove get in what is essentially a fairly easy length Deport the board down there spotting once again Toby using such as presents to consider the trades with rookie grounds him for then after shock make that all happened a couple times we've come this Lane and seeing those abilities used in the one on one that means you can't stop the bodies have anymore so it's certainly important within the track and has Nick is closer to 60 than farming well right he's already got more than 10 camps done and then without ultimate can certainly try to force the kill seeing the trades continue hearing Federal Pest Control wad but side does stop any early infantile stop from Griffin pretty decently would have Donald Drake and obviously as a team that has a pretty low damage profile later you want any person of all you can get right now so far to set up north are and if we think about the overall pace of this game even though there's a 500 goalie for IG I would say this is much more of a griffin Style game been denied each other in terms of debt every split Griffin is played in the lck they've had the fewest guess in the lck they are a low error League of Legends team Invictus gaming despite making it to world had the most deaths in the LPL summer split they are a very high error team that is willing to take risk and often times without play you through more good place that overpower the bad so I had this conversation earlier this week what would like the combined kills per minute break point ATP for IG to win versus for Griffin to win and we think it ends up having to be very high just because of the way Griffin is used to playing so this is very much a griffin paste game which despite the goal we do it after the aunt makes you think you're in a decent position maybe just give them something resembling a failing drop on the first day of wild going for the on and going for a lot of late game scaling in this sort of a game we can't just give the past month based on his dark performance with kind of flow pill games we do have to look at IGN say okay if I take a lot of punch and I
welcome back for game number to this best-of-five keep this the first one you missed a lot of 44 minute of a game I do want in the lake game team fight and we are back around longer available and I wonder what a dick is game is going to counter with ears they're very slow with their second set of hicksLee sin already locked here they know they want this one of the Jungle pick for Ding and a play something volatile you have to imagine the size absolutely helpless sure but that was supposed to pick Jace I think it's important and we still actually don't know if Griffin is completely abandoned to guarantee that's a big question we have to try it again or they actually going to switch it up bass player three roles in solo queue as recently as yesterday they very much like the entrywaymy back to the expected Bottom lyrics here I appreciate your effort trying with the gerund pick themselves that you of course apartment pick was available to come back right away or even the very expect the bottom line here no surprises to Champions come through and wait to see what Chris come through later on in the Frat he's an opportunity to try and pinch Tarzan camping pool because they taken away at least in progress was pre ban Kiana's going to Lisa's gone and I also wouldn't be too surprised to see Jovi go with something like a galley on the Midway but we'll have to see when possible so I don't mine at least patio style bands to come out here in Champion by lightning is that it will notjungler also knocked out yeah a lot of your the cop gone gragas Panda weigh at least handle a wreck Side Band at least intake and we certainly need a jungler still for Griffin and they have left essentially rookie did find his counter magic without any further bands chords that one and now with a support needed as well as paw plan to look at the options between oppositely Ona everyone's you play against rakan Nautilus women walking for Bel Air with the bottom line picks so far and you can see they're definitely saving the Chive counter for last night's game in fact this is about a stent removed from game number one draw actually going up against the kale from the shy to Champion of champ the winky face can go I don't expect too shy to Win It game over block tops that we have, but unlikely we seen something very similar to this matchup already out of short it was again to wonders kale however what was interesting to me about that match vs was actually very close between those two all the way up until the mid game and it was the map to Pro for round the kale that ended up stopping him so I can definitely understand why the child would go something like kale and she's going to be able to just get to his strong point and then win match up against the best Korean tops over in China on the shy so I think he is confident it's going to be on the sword is most played by a mile and I'm excited about going to happen now that we got Viper with his diet and his hand to take over the game is beautiful Arena of Spanish viewers and we'll see what kind of show these players can put on for us now the second game here I she defended their world championship title Griffin naked when they're second-best to 5 it is many years since joining the lck we'll see if they can do that here we are on to the rift game number 2 as the bay skates drop we can do battle and always such a pivotal game in the best-of-five series how disastrous it can be to fall down O2 or how advantageous it can be 14 like igf who had multiple sweeps throughout their worlds run last year 3 owing the semi-finals and the finals looking to kind of stopped down on Griffin in this game to you really feel like if it goes down 202 from a griffin side not this again might be a thorn in their minds rather than competing earnestly for the victory here level ones for now much more of a 5.2 is coming out from the side of IG understandably just wanted to stop that from being vertical jungling if possible and allow the kale as even a laning phase as you can get don't mention Spalding up and we can see you now is ever goes to the various Lane klepto Caleb there klepto LeBlanc press the attack is a little bit less common on sorry I'm flaking what type is named there we go but will be fun to watch all the same question this game is In My Head Jason runs a kale should be priority line for the Chaser least have a lot more that even though like you mentioned that there is a Counterpoint pain to Wellness performance and also bought things and no list at level two hits level to look at any time at 4 open Otisco toppin dunk down on the shy and get the flash down early for that is what you had a story that first spray it happened right there lens both cubes and all those ones and the size truck down text me to of the crossing potions tax already bottomland kind of walking back and forth waiting for the agent to happen just going to go in for snacks right now. You can see how the eventual LeBlanc. Plays often before she gets pain to the back with me and let a very big CT condo would make life easy their balance much down there. Cool. Try the second ago I think for the most part the galio matchup against LeBlanc just looks to neutralize the block which is why I really like rookies kleptomancy because he says okay if you're going to neutralize me at least I'm going to get rich off of it and then kind of Hit the two items PowerPoint we're out then look to Rome I think that's going to be rookie strategy here so let's track the CSM Isola lanes because we know it was very favorable for the shine game 1 and rookie has been a. leaner throughout the group stage would look to try and dominate in this game otherwise chovy will neutralize leave the lane and try and pull off jarvin galio combos on other parts of them are very unlikely to teleport LeBlanc any Killzone galio might meet here and then has the information advantage does stay away from the sweeper so no outline Spa deadening still around Jovi not yet back to the late he's hoping the Tarzan uses cooldowns and actually where to see if I can easily comes over to buy for a root plants real Cuban doll and has to run away the re-engage available in a few seconds. Going to go for the more kills with a Scuttle and the kill go to Griffin know how much he loved and from that easily and I think just an odd play buy IG right there they didn't have Midland priority they didn't really have bought Lane priority but clearly someone said hey help me with Scuttle crab let's go for it and Griffin was just way faster than that but I think it was said they didn't see me we can watch them though Viper available wearing the key land this land as we can see in fact double defensive summon a spouse tattoo heal barrier being brought back not going to play football tonight apparently isn't here is that box side play, Toby hit the Taunton youth jacket I was going down and getting the flak early was what ended up winning that fight for Griffin knowing the jackula was a level 3 flash with Kaiser kind of allow them to very easily pick their target different music Joy Division albums made to the fact that it's he'll on lens and the barrier on viper really front of the keeping him alive against the assassination of potential of stay a little longer adults out of the novelist you want to point out how bad top winds going for the shy well played by sword that's a good time as well but sword with 8:15 c s Forester lyrics to this is a great return to form of the Griffin talk later have to again point out the electrocute Chase yep instead of a phase Rush Jays so definitely going for stronger trays in lieu of a little bit of safety and potentially late-game chase down damage will be better early on Tulane as he's been able to get good Pokemon on the shy don't have a lot of tools is kale to deal with Chase and the other game transformer all the abilities and the inferior jungle to be too as well be hounding problem solvers himself out of the scenario he's in my kiss end up being a pal family just fix it this point is definitely counts when coupling many to beaches as far as when people arrive to the power of the ultimate to be able to negate the other team's burst and then still fight back I've seen a lot of Hales me down 15cs early and then would have to be absolutely that's what the oldest set up for a bit then you start being swayed by he'll bury about land galio ultimate you have to be really on point with cooldowns here but on paper here is where he's taken some damage open the kaito away does jumping that's pretty old for it as well low health bars red Sprite and funny damage there from Tarzan yeah that's going to really help out she'll be in this Lane especially at this level six point with no teleport rookies going to be completely out of corrupting potion is chobe is full so at this point rookie can't very safely farm kleptomancy and it will give chovy the ability to Roman influence other lane access multiple fires Web Tales trying to deal with J Smith Lane is also going the way of Galileo temporarily and that's the perfect time to walk down onto the infernal Drake that controls ever since to kill on Jackie love when they should be uncontested two games in a row. Maryland parental great stuff they are certainly looking pretty solid here only the last game of the details but the lanes work good enough to go give us to add IG this time around the lanes are great you got the most of them was well Buster Drake was everything else has a great really gave her Griffin and it's on Griffin to actually continue to accelerate this because they are up against double kleptomancy still awake and Nicole Hiser so I G have very clearly said that they're just going to wait a little bit and hope the Griffin can't punish them too hard upon us down here but usually walked away from lens is fine after shock as well on this ra, Dulce Guardian sometimes the champion right to go to support your back going to come around feel and Tanaka for the charms going to get the armored him or let himself and on topside Spotify award but level 6 on both the jungle and the Top Value heading over there that's the big one trophy could match this and then decide to not fight yeah one of the few Champion to can help his paw plane from mid just going invisible is enough to stop me from doing anyting ning isn't even willing to stick around for the control were killed it took a lot of time for LeBlanc to push in the minion waves to understood that given the amount of time required for the right set-up unlikely to pick up a kill himself bottom Lane Griffin cracking open the source of gold but it is still available after the play very decisive Lane gay coming through from bucks I think it's another lead on to the Kaisers kind of crown jewel of this ID, and those are the types of plays we saw against Griffin in their second or for Griffin in their second round robin just incredibly clean play scene in top side ueno play as possible Bots I'd get gold on to your carry now it's just a matter how clean can they stay cuz as we song game 1 IG can still bring these games back with any big Play optimystique Owl as you know why you think of a white flag and that's another reason that suddenly and there's only two Tower update available but side that happier to go for Target Dives yeah cuz they know that I'd be the first thought is a half step back not a half step forward and set the cold by the word a certain Casey to start doran's blade he died with 500 gold yet I can either go long sort of AFK for Allure going to call have more region in my life better laning item in Elsa could buy put this dive just so good knock off into knock up and doesn't look like the flash was necessarily up all those sometimes it can be unreliable few will definitely have it for the next one well played
which is a hair Griffon just hasn't been able to find a true answer for so I love what's pancit on the desk there about trying to get Jovi in a place where he can actually just go One V one against rookie I knew wonder how far back they have to roll to find the show to come for that talk about what about on full Sora Tavares. As it's on the right side when did series open would I pay envelope to the force that game played this one probably wear with the Care on you be coming through and everything else that follows 2 so I see what is most important it is still Keanu the question is are Griffin doing on here theokay if we would have seen another poppy scaring you me then it would have been going next year in the past back in your septic on is dropped but this time I'm lahens the rainokay you know that Nautilus and Leona are the likely picks in her, you know we're talking supporting a flexible champion in that regard those days are long past but are they more worried about getting a jungler or something else is like a jungle mid top and it said Morgana come through instead no longer playing the hard engage support but some in a little bit safer pretty conventional need the Kate Mogan a long time ago against Iraq on Farrakhan will be locked in here with have to imagine the north I mean yasso Upon a Time did earlier than we wrote back and there's a lot they can do flexibility wise of these bands I would actually hope to see a kale van since Griffin doesn't want to get out late game again in my opinionmaybe it's the big lake game Powerhouse band you could see it I guess yeah Fiora instead that makes me think that he's going to read something that can you call a guy on I-70 in summer that is a possibility that you don't sort your on a heartache we're going to go straight if you fight and get a Beat the only time that is a threat. Left open to be selected I guess by the side of Griffin comfort and yet don't know if it was actually a contestant understand it because Invictus gaming has gone what with what looks like fairly comfortable pics dust far and Griffin doesn't want to give him something to potentially run through the Olaf if we see the Scion on the Scion I could I could be well goes to rookie in Medford left what was the top Lane Champion be in this crap ton of Midland paint one more time is the final but you have to feel like that's based on reputation right now I agree I want to be Tobe be someone who gets to be to carry get to be a big deal but not forever and you know maybe that works out okay go trick-or-treating Zion want to play a squishy Champion into Keanu show me saying okay I'm not going to let you kill me it's working late and failed in the game well we'll see what they look like he or 312 Guildford about somebody pee but sort this is the most pressure on him it's been it's been steadily ramping up in increasing it was Bernard the chaos now he is in game number to those temporary do you want to bring up I think he engaged schools are much easier on the grip inside a Scion as well as work on making art deco heartaches on the side of victims gaming leads that might be a bit more difficult here this week is certainly a differently shaped game Embassy here in game 3 up against it all over sweet must happen for Griffin if they want to stay alive or icy sweet their way into the semis Luger second world on this one out and even though Griffin made that week of throwing kale in the Top Lane this composition looks very similar to the style they have played in their first to defeat they need to play heavily around and through Viper and lands Jovi is going to try and neutralize rookie in the mid lane and they're going to have to play maybe even perfectly because I'm looking at IG scaling and how well they can find flanks and how experienced they are and how good they been playing this series it feels to me like the odds are stacked against Griffin in this being really strong with the theory here is a Scion can initiate from the midline easier than the galio hill Russian if I pass the same start theoretically it's easier for him to knock down the dominoes but not as reliable I feel like sciatica bet someone who can out raynes a cop off the backup the Scion die choices of the two top layers this shy about team Fight the Power Over All Phase Rush good at chasing things down for the klepto board sort when I get items in inventory as soon as possible that is wanting to track if they build scale up over time I think between the naderi and the shy debate about Vladimir the shy almost always goes with the phase Rush since he's looking to get his gold basically by Smashing the opponent and then actually tries to teamfight much earlier and that's Wednesday is Russia's going to be much more valuable than kleptomancy so not too surprised to see those stones even though it is good to point out the back of the get rid of all the feathers going to stay alive here this morning waiting for them to come out and give you the one being in there it is and it's going to be simply balanced walking over to Ward and make sure they can try to track Tarzan over there but leave door at bottom side jungles in this world will see yes indeed blue is gone if Trump is gone okay we know the big passing she's probably topside now unless you can bear to the right by Miley favorite words and no that's not happening that has to push up what's down the ward probably expected to be a broadside game from The Jungle Book is gagging for k036 not very valuable and even then not all combinations will work combination of Sion Annalise will be a very powerful level six hits per control for CVS on the map me is going to be a very small fee of sleep tight black shield getting away from that one no problem. I can feel safe yep that's how you want to play the match up with lions actually unable to even get an Aftershock on this Aftershock we're gone it's something he definitely favors were most of them end up going Guardian so for blackshields happen like that I Do's going to be all the windows traits would have assumed Guardian because if you get hit by the top binding you're not profiting off to shop and you are very very squishy as lands and it doesn't need to be a flash primary engaged or with a Scion on the seems to me a little bit surprised for muscle memory that will bring that and make that the choice you need to get a guardian Shield YouTube and gets Bound for useful there as well but again that's not the flight here so we move on we haven't really cool game of the super early we can see ACS lead in top and mid year for Griffin but the bottom is looking good. His gaming side that is ever going to counter pick doing some work for you of course it makes it very hard to do anything as the rakan you can so just ignore in a lot of cases now it's supposed to be coming out as well not going to end up wasting a little bit of time with that teleport in not as bad as you would think though since he had I believe channel that teleport from base was on a reset already sidestep was very impressive from Jovi on Coon most likely would have gone down there of it's not that tankey in the early game free items to PSI on the other good black shield another jump back for the hens in the Tracy going back and forth is just going to besides active not read it out by this still pushing away is in 1 c f goes with a W landing and now no cooldowns available but no man available not going to find me a gauge either a spot of the Saiyans doing the flanks and either but how can I buy Tarzan says I want the 400 gold yeah that was just an excuse to die by Griffin but now short has to survive rookie has the flash they played it just right trailer for the ocean drink but I got to say all that all present favorite Griffin favorite if they cannot you turn this into control wars in the river you can Unstoppable on start your way to repay games if ever bilena Jackie love walked past the middle point of the lane IG do capitalize on the best and they can get which the counter pill top hits. Even so much over there for Savoy you look at the fact that if he was already down that's two waves night of the current what's the plate taken it said actually huge lead in the topside fisheye over sort of killing does a decent job of not making it super easy for Viper to be able to get that killed Bin Ends up going over Tarzan you look pretty this is actually fascinating the rookie has swapped out of that lane y'all can go on top against kit kale potentially having a little bit more kill pressure cuz I was expecting Griffin to just repeat that I've done bottling over and over again and they won't be able to do that if show me matches Top Lane I don't think Griffin should be matching this I mean this is what they want nachos for this is why they want to play armor back Scion rookies Kiana they don't want to give Elena get someone's know it's not the sun go could not find the DACA means no kokuin land rookie playset really well from the other line so I still get something from this even though it is almost acting against black pens. I do have to question Griffin's choices there though because getting a kill on chovi will not win them this game getting kills for Viper breaking that bottom turret advancing the game in that way we'll make it possible so what I do is done here by pulling Toby talk in Tarzan with him is it completely relieve the pressure on the bottom side where there's a flashes won't Morgana like he'll is Kaiser and unless Griffin finds a way to get back to that by side pressure feel like I do to me very comfortable rookie will find out and from that chovy will only be a Scion rather than someone who can act as an early game like his very deep Behind Enemy Lines dive crew for situation here for a rookie the state's leading in the blue team blank Topsham you still get to get that one handed over no problem that could have been different in an alternate universe but works out positively for him to 300 Old Lee what is Invictus gaming stake in this game Griffin with the ocean that we should have some small bits going back to hurt them arguably a slightly better state for them overall and we wait to see what comes through with
Musso & Frank I think in terms of momentum probably a little bit towards Griffin but it's too hard to say we've seen Griffin actually win one game after being down to vote in the summer find if it has Katie and then lose the series Invictus gaming pull back from attempted riversweeps like last year at world again Katie so can't wait to see how this series continues to play out there looking for what's different in the pick and ban LeBlanc knocked off the table we looked at you know the game 3 traffic looks so similar to the game 1 through to where we had a big does on the red LeBlanc was a big factor there blue side has been what's dropped by Griffin in this game to potential Nang or Tarzan Champion base open we already mentioned solo queue this is a three-way Flex the Griffin even to the boat Lane as well so no surprise it is over officeand we didn't see a kill back so we know that the LeBlanc value with how well rookie played in game 2 is still incredibly High wouldn't be too surprised if we saw a fairly High party on Kale bi-ig maybe brackets here as well right that's one can spend the night from Invictus every single time they finally get it here it is there go to start they did win a game of the forest that was the Arsenal game back in the very first one that's why they drew a bad for it on my block coming in directly a happy about her know we will take them or we will take this away IG content Griffin actually Piper was 7 and one point in game 2 and ended game 3 8 no but he was also the kale we've been talking about self in a lot of waysthese teams are still prioritizing exactly the same Champions that they have for the whole series actually not that much your adjustments throughout the series which I think is barely fitting since these are too confident teams and all three games have been fairly close as that weird thing with Griffin lost came to on the blue side with very simple similar Champion choices and yet if you can have that 18 minutes over again you kind of have to take it as a top-10 please. Far ahead with that strong an early game and yes copy result orientated about the WL at the Edwards how great the other day I went to see if they just go super standed blueside get two games in a row on the side of birthwhy do vans come through with more jungle pressure down getting again rid of magic damage junglers dragons at least definitely talk to you they're the Yas when it was paired smells great as last time that was gone do you reckon Griffin could go driving galio skin could they actually run back exactly the same thing came, they hadn't came through because they banned of a Blog which was the one thing they found access on to Pfeiffer as a possibility as well with a yasso band coming through so I'm going to see if they just really do fully roll a backwood find a hybrid because the jungler would be at go I think actually would at least in open they probably go least in AP made the possibility you could also be something that a lot of the lck teams that huge priority on this world that against kale talking about rookie year play the intro maker won that game for the kill themselves going to leave that one up to chance we'll see what that ends up going the Scion we're expecting to go in the mid lane but I can still move about based on how they want to play this one I could easily see Uncle John is going to come through really hasn't worked in a long way home and find this in the early game unlikely 0.8 Katie jungle doesn't have cc to try to kind of laying really and then it just all falls apart so because the battle so you can get laid virtual ago but came out late game to carry it through I'm really curious to see how the atrox I'm at your place because of the nurse for patch 919 that hurt the boxes with clear I wonder if he's just going to be a male a champion to get shoved in and they're hoping for maybe some type of cactuses or if they can get priority over mid then they can start controlling the river against the car that you can be one of the first four to five levels are actually as good or better if it's the mid-to-late game that he talked his way up there now falls off in this world so I'm expecting a good base now the game actually plays out though back against the wall to take reliable jungle Carthage can you seal the deal here and then go in the game 5 and do it all over again Invictus gaming go have a talk with him unless they have fish guy who is the best top laner in this matchup buy a bar back on back ready to carry flea has well this is going to be an exciting game for how does IG roll from the fountain here Griffin keep a lot of that piece of similar on their last game on the blue side honestly over the series Once Again being gift-wrapped desire rack on Facebook if we go to a game 5 that will not stay true you'd have to think so and just to recap a little bit about how these team got here Griffin had one of the best individual days we've ever seen of worlds on their second round robin going 4-0 putting up a seven-point to kill to death ratio on that day and then I G while they did look good in group stage did not win the group they still have that world championship roster all five members now from that 2018 World team starting here jumped out in the series to a 12-lead despite some clothes game kind of all of us were holding our breath to see if Griffin will just kind of roll over and die they did not in that game and now we're in this refreshed series really to see if Griffin can continue to play solid games or if I G can find another crushing fight to end the series but has famously never really had too much game consists lot of cops out there and I know you're out there somewhere I'll ask the ones I'm just Powell if I'm impressed out and then just play that particular place that works when your lanes are at the moment you fall behind don't have a lot of power with a really influence the result from that stuff you need a lot of planning and X is getting the right matchups and also just wave states to be able to allow cops to do is think about the way these Lanes could play outside work on should be a favor to me to against Ice Tea Leoni even if there is some skill matchups to play and it can be close to the chase should be able to beat the killer Lee and if Joey can get Lane priority over rookie which at least a level one looks like a can they have the potential to play that Tree whinning Lane with a farm in Carthage style but when the jungler comes in states where jungle come Spotlight level 3 can take every Zen inflate and not care at all about the enemy jungler will get counter pills that for the jungle ability for the strongest ganking junglas vs at X Anon ganking jungler that just means a lot of power and thing which is that you know a double-edged sword because of how little actual Bond fight in the bottom side put it back there was just talking about going to be there in just go with that the lead singer of Jarvan you're second-guessing whether or not you can go for that level to play similar situations over it would be pretty exciting a couple of packs in there for a rookie but the Top Lane going similarly as well at with how much pressure we're seeing it actually try pushing and sort again not afraid of a karthus gate coming through as likely not to die so able to farm pretty well so far these lames looking decent will point out that Toby Wilkins rookie V length and stand against the goddess jumping is going to camp for Camp. Does just mean he's going to have pretty good idea about respawn time is on both sides and make it more informed can test on future phones but it does mean to cause any thoughts are you going to get the rest out is topside trick shot for his troubles and that's maybe not worth it still has some potions leftover pulled one back to that gets him happy. Back anyway things going to come by these okay grab that one it's Dylan unspotted name at the moment if short ends up going for an over-aggressive trade taking that his jungler has control you're like the strangest maybe on a 400 Health though you know on to the JC it just because it's broader scale so because of that probably not going to be fine but she was revealed earlier and continues to investigate hoping that was camps cats a really good knock Capelli almost gets rid of a jackula that's a lot of damage knocked down though A-line spawning an entrance ear damage Landing cars excuse on the shiz got to be some type of nightmare impressed with how well this has been able to Juke historically so there was a little bit of time there for Tarzan to stick around all those Grom has responded I wonder if Nick is actually able to counter drunk a little bit pretty Proteus minimap backwards no worries. This is more than you would expect necessarily out of Lane impact so that's something that Jace can potentially take advantage of lost sword but the way Frozen for now under is terrible stop to reset it was a full wave still there in the group inside and it's a teepee comes through for sort of the week or so they come through for sword looks like the time we go to shove it without much issues so not going to do too much should reset no problem maybe even the nicest csr2 as if he comes back to the store that sell FedEx you will deny if you're a little bit of pee and we look at these hoplite now reset again with fairly equal farm and arguably better items on sword rookie still holding fairly equal to Midway michova Anthony about his match up and it's going to continue to improve for a little while here with Mommy Cinder he'll be able to shove in quickly but ning hoping for that game what a predator boots and sword is looking to push up now the time is right there and sort of the body slam that's a really good flashed is the correct direction to put start certainly be done by noon right there there was always going to be that game Chicken about whether or not your flash you're getting your body slam off and he cuts them off enough to not let the sword get away and then you know the source of an opportunity for a counter kill this guy was in front not letting the shot glass blow back to me and the counter play by gryffin do is to also get the ocean Drake LBC good to pick up an early ocean Drake here even the carthus is going to be a big fan of this and really wants to feel blue It's relatively greedy but he can kill a pretty fast God of War but no one's around the top of what he's going to explain that one this might even available if he needs it got to be able to save that one on top of it there so early on top of it, short of level 6 on MacArthur being played by The Flash. Shows the right time to do it I wonder if it was a full disengage Avail from the he was thrown out to prevent the flash back towards the church but now with a flash list Jace who just has the wave in the wrong spot to try to be able to do them off for a while quite a lot here and yes give me a pill called idea but the Drake is something the issue is that now the shy probably is going to always at worth go for cs4cs maybe even get more kills and get more head-on cage and we already know how that pays off in the late game you have to hook the car this is what I want to see if this guy is actually continuing that freeze because if he holds that he's going to be able to get a massive CS Advantage there's control Ward Supremacy in that Top Lane Shorewood basically have to push up past halfway without Flash in order to even get farm and less Tarzan goes up there and help them shove it in there was like he is a ward doubt he's been fairly slow here so this is certainly a lot of money being lost and it likely gets worse from here and slowly but surely he's going to be okay is alright finally have stored and rain but sort of feel like outside right lens that q but nothing happens without the biggest bear in the shop I let the wave sit in front of his threat of flash was Jace how do you survive the Kraken stick is the reality show out play possible on that and that's why he does have a spotting no matter I know is he's on cool down to the surprise of the opportunity what's a sweeper where's the board there's the word okay that's or running away and once again look at the rookie gets all three sweet spots going to be knocked up either starting to fight back now with 20 CDR in the bill either Shore needs to leave.
Stacy and will stop with the Bracketology patio with Ricky level with right now because they beat them with the fiana rumble last time but you I don't like to see been away so many kind of mint defining picked as the blue side team often times you want to kind of for the other team has many bandsdisrupted into the game being able to speed it up Kaiser rolls result liquid trying to that last name of the length but we know the way that they hate you like to do that it true have you squirming around Ray both trying to drag the early to the play because he is one of those dark areas on this line up so I like the fact that most of the bands that played already gotten rid of the key on a rumble however they got 22nd to make the choice to decide if they really do want to do that but I think putting your eggs in a basket as a good choice between liquid and now I'm coming if you are a hater what do you have in response to pick is it going to be I was going to say maybe if I cuss or Vegas cuz I can't even remember how to pronounce that that be as nice as real as a thing you can play and desire Uzi try to many times yesterday to mixed success I think one of the more important things that age he was going for is the German take away it's something that they banned again in the first game and it's something they wanted for themselves here I think that she'll probably end this was our economy progress will have to see I think it's time to take down going to lock that one in and then we'll see if they do indeed go for that same jungle matchup TL one thing we did see if them at MSI where they made it to the finals they beat the rush Champions Invictus gaming was it wasn't about that bo5 and now we'll see if he wants to bring out something else that's unique to them as they go around and okay yes Jensen second game of the block here I can see it I think that the champion pool is going to get a little pinch in the second phase of bandwidth based on the way. Jensen performed in the last game they played where he died a bunch of times trying to get him onto a chance of that have had success on if we remember Jensen's LeBlanc against someone would probably his best game of the group stage so completely understand why there was a block here laundromat cost would increase and she now really struggles to be able to deal with the way I played Philip Lowe Windsor pushing this matchup that has very good priority On the Run Tour if your eye play the Lincoln Tunnel is involved for Rainbird model before Jensen to take something like a cleanse however I feel like it is no longer a proactive matchup I feel like more options are available for Jensen to be able to take over the map it's more of a late-game counter because the cool downs and the Mana cost recovery so even if you're willing to print reminder for what are the game Utah plane often that you get the last pic of this entire drafted you support any they most likely toppling over to clean option at least a juggler out of TL being the top down bottom light disrupt a lot of the aggression is going to come out of liquid now the problem is is when you play these Mage 4th and it's something like to look into dialogue options going to be a little bit it would have been mr. Eliana as far as I'm taking this is safer play for them you look at really having a place to hang stuff for the topside here it could be the last day of world to know it goes are they going to put impact on a camera that you can have an impact on the game liquid point of impact with bright Global accent and maybe the best aggressive bottom line and jungle on the back text Missy and TL has had it so far in this world championship self quite happy about this rap for to look at in Wolf will see what I was going to do because it looks like they ended up going with a lot of countermatch think like I said at the time thing maybe we'll end up seeing this in the quarterfinals but this was also several days later and now I'm going to throw this one out there right ideas what The Simpsons Simpsons fans Yeah Usher the first 300 episode that one now and then he's like why doesn't mine look like that I feel like when you have a look at liquids wine upright it's like to fix it all fits together every night but you kind of see on the side of a heck you and you see where it's going to look like that I feel like it's just such a straight to go backwards when you have a supremely hot and gate 80 carry one and only North America well we got some Team Liquid fans in the audience and of course plenty watch down the street right now TL the last DLC sahq sadly entire league failed to make it out the LMS but I can play spoiler here once again we have a very scientific, coming out of Lakewood you understand exactly what this composition wants to be able to do that have a very good movie to win the ball of my day going to look to gain pressure in the mid lane rotate football team. They have the Gangplank to supplement all of that however on the side of the HQ that have picked purely for Lane County is I failed and when you do that you must win lanes and it seems like they at least have CC follow-up to chain with the Jarvan gang so she will probably look to either to be to mate and then crash that pressure by Saints vs just wanting to be to ask you is going to be looking to either kill Jensen or go up top and shutdown impact I'm with the one thing I will say about the HQ, is I feel like they do come online Strat slightly Alia Azrael at to Wadhams outperform is most 80 carries that I currently in metal specially wants to transport of the Moon romantic is there as well as lissandra also just great pick tools in the midday so I feel like he hates you were going to have to win do around 15 to 20 minutes to set up the math and look for those kills I want to point out when did Crouch you for Jensen Auto going rainbow once it's actually bigger than it looks gold plating on cool down the next time he does go for a quick second. Has the top win his fight back and forth by the way for the GP again grasping too much more common Keystone in front of what he can is ziv will try to push down how to see how that one place. I feel like that's a very risky move by impact because she'll got to something that can actually match GP with early trade part of the way that you could get through level six and starts killing these items is he so strong really early on with grass Auto tax to be able to proc that impact can't do that here so he's probably going to be giving over some Lane priorities is it just cho'gath if you can stack up the grass for the undying you can pray very efficiently with the poly that's a trading patent we see was it keeps away fairly neutral have the package going to continue to push the wave ever is able to trade on to him he'll kill him and then the danger of pushing away is if you think any fire Russia you might just die anyway is Itachi dominate this matchup when he played cho'gath vs. Gangplank it was within early gang so so really we'll see how that works out as rainbow you can already taste even the fact that he has been Trading you can shut the wave that quickly make it strong for the Saundra as well ran forward to dodge the change and then get the full trade out there as well as when I pee pee on Jensen we sometimes speaks lens on the Block to get out of the flash engage combos that there will not have that luxury of eight levels gate comes in however it is important to note the fact that Jensen still does have a potion available where is Rainbow I just choked through every child right now is a corrupting potion so whilst he's parody in the HP was that is going to be a slight Advantage for the TL mid laner this is a problem right now with lysandra she is very resource-intensive outnumbering is a fight of his bottom River we've seen these fights go in a sling for LCS teams before they're still sticking around Dublin but still Alex taking a bunch there double for the flash awake or fast as flash as well as spells were on cool down in that looking to look at more outside I actually had the lane party in the bottom lady but he's been so long on the Scuttle crab it allows Azrael to make it all the way in the River end Double if he's the one that's getting caught out normally when you have black Friday if you just stick with your younger the other team can't do this to you but double it next to figure out of safe and then they think they're in the clear after flashing the wall but rainbow then has the mid-length push willing to commit everything to get to Route and that book is a screw the early Edge and the decisiveness from a hate you I feel like this is what we sold last time they played against liquid appeal is a game plan and again we see you once again everything thrown in there that's going to be a flash used on Alex as well as rainbow But ultimately they do get the kills a native where's the teepee out of ss with his hairy awkward purchase there a long sword and a dagger components of later items see if they can turn that one around right now 900 goldleaf puts HQ ahead about what you expect for early kills like those and now it's a flash plus bottomley team liquids stronger to be too is what they want to be able to play through but it's so difficult now that they don't have River control and they don't have flashes on either of those players so they're not really able to place your top anyway it's meant to be weak side top of the fact that the strength of their team now has to play conservatively will put Team Liquid behind for a good portion of this game and he will be able to get level 5 of the two remaining Camp II buff he's going to spawn a couple of minutes so when you have a look at how this game should play out he should end up on the bottom side of the map with that ultimate with a flashlight bottom line to attack TV comes back in the top side now as well and I'm just to get pretty decent recalls on both sides and packed with shein plus an extra Mana regen and this is how you got the full ninja tabi is there to that David can chase the point of downright no boots in the game plank that can make things really really scary nice route right there guarantees the Aftershock gets on that trades not to have him Jensen wonder where the next play is going to be cuz it's also a level 6 lesandro that often wants to try and go aggressive that Twix Mitzi is your shadowing Jensen worried about this play the Choo Choo from the sodder level 6 is pretty strong still I thought was only magic resistance as well so should be able to shrug off a lot of what Smitty's damage and Jensen's damage is at the same stage of the game no penetration picked up and you can see that he's very cranky was surprisingly thank you for this day to the game HQ can do here because they've had a few advantages throughout this group stage that they have been unable to close out as Alex move towards bottom and they're looking to pin for a little bit we're coming down spotting him but with the wave controlled as it is to control where dies just after it's placed under a difference for that kind of situation for it because the start of every good aggressive play is control and look how much of that they have on the bottom side without flashing very hot 40 L to be able to push out in that bottom right now that be invaded in the bottom side jungle you can say that this Alex more choices he can I dilute account of jungle maybe go for that Red Bluff once it respond power it dies always going to be on the table and it looks like I'd say bring rainbow into the play that is what I asked you was decided last was always double if it's a boy or we three on level five here comes on in jumps for look for the old he finds the roof play Only One Direction without you in a positive situation so far as you've got a lot happening across this side of big damage is Sarah's going to go down and walk over to the air to play Two Worlds Apart of Might and you saw even with the advantage even with the early movement Gangplank ultimate just swings the tide of that died and that can be so huge for TLC more Ralph
tide in the standings and I want to quickly posit that if I keep the form they had in the first game they look like the favorite in this to me looks like at least to me the battle for the last spot in the quarterfinals of course there's still more to be played with this is a type 1A anything after what we've seen so far in the Pro Champion point out that was the early van Renekton by he looked at on blue side I think quietly Renekton has gone under the radar as the second strongest champion of the world second highest present exactly 9:00 and 2 when he goes through with specifically finding it on Blue tide he liquid not confident in flexing that pick between mid and pop which is going to hurt their overall flexibility additionally when you have a look at something like Deon or as well which was saying in mid top Band jungle this is an old pitbull for the liquid line up I don't necessarily have the most flexible solar lanterns but when they are on their pick they do have great impact so I think that this is the game plan this is what you should expect and liquid is a lot of gamescrypto fought in World a game plan is very difficult to disrupt I feel getting the best Marksman on the patch for doublelift is certainly going to be a step in the right direction and I think it's even better for them to first pick this because nuclear it's so comfortable and I said looking at this group overall I feel like Dom Juan and after you are somewhat similar in the back of their very sole focus and it's based off of having the same coach coach him without his coach in 2018 and and Don Juan's coach now and Team Liquid is much more applied Focus T believe her only Hospital on flexibility with the propensity to take a Mason to the bottom line is they need to be able to balance a composition bookduplex pixel eyes it's one of the most flexible person who picks you can have a specially cuz it's not often you have a support jungleplex I got is also a big block light bulb order has been at Worlds I would say he's been out the potent so far the question is can he keep up that level of play first time they played he played Jarvan with the support galio and they pulled off some good combos that's not what they're going to be able to do today so mechanical definitely put to the test or xmithie now I've been really critical of the cow pic throughout the entirety of the world championship I think I tend to agree with your motto but it has turned into a little bit of a bite out of the conditions for kale when she is going to be successful from what we saying is he ability for the carry you going to all to get themselves into the fight now who benefited brackets yes will combo to be able to set that up if this is going to beI made or bottom line kale we painted candy protected in the toilet Lane old would not support and with the right amount of vitamin could certainly set up a very potent I've called likely to be a middling know if we look at the performance from Jensen in week one I think it's a risk that a dumb one of the willing to take that they don't think the answer would have to El play it and then that would push the gas where the stuff is going I think that's the best bet they would have loved to have seen Caleb and Katie play that with just Moana in the middle and that would likely he was the final bands come through a r l e n Vladimir to really be a notary champion from what I've seen so far he wants to be able to push up and take over some of those ripped the right side is it felt to be the bottom side of the map to the soo gragas in my opinion so we'll see how the rest of the drive goes yeah and you could see how many Solon band Team Liquid was throwing probably because they're expectingCastle Rock to a bottom late anyway cuz he blind box will there any bands out of here so I wouldn't really do that so much but born blind the Saiyans are going to play here because I guess they think I'm looking for a sauna be up in the meadow over here so high on a Nivea in an all-important game of the start of week 2 going to be incredibly potent however anivia historically has not felt well with anything that can bolt on top of an idiot if you interrupt the ultimate can't lie to a bad time in that actually is going to beangry playing tabletop they can do it now because this island isn't going to be a lame boy so potentially I believe it's possible Scion hits real hot and if you take it. You have something like a lease in for like the follow-up 300 damage solar loan Lane 94 world so far thank you another one of the top physical damage ones but Corky of course not be sweating show America's play plenty of times is it going to be a very exciting draft to see because impact part of the reason to you one last time would that impact was so much better than agree several important one draft in my head because also corki mid has greatly falling off but schomaker would be confident with Corky person if you match up and we're going to have to see how the other game plays out and whether or not those Soul enters end up being volatile siding match up here T liquor download welcome back what is the last team remaining from North America right now. After this one open again to keep Pace with Sophie to make it into the quarter-finals groups absolutely in as we take a look at these compositions one more time I do want to throw back to what Missy said on the desk he said he's being surprised at which the pace the team liquid has currently play the game he thought I would be much slow off much more we have much more about that team fight well if there is a confidence built for that I think we have located on summoner's Rift absolutely and Timothy's Point Team Liquid did work on their ability to close games quickly in the ALCS they had the lowest average game time and the best early game of all the teams in the ALCS so even though they play more control that doesn't mean that they haven't been able to close out games quickly and on the side of Dom Juan de trucos up games for the quickly but typically not with early game strength is this Alliance well are we seeing the lion swap you can see the level one in Bay tell me on the top side of the maps is taking Raptor can have changed so listen Loki sportsbeat Dom Juan in game one of their best at 5 with the Lancelot it's because not everyone is completely disrespectful to the strategy and allowed himself to get do this isn't impact taking the red. This is par for the course don't worry that you got to read about this plan so if you'll be closer to level 2 by the time he heads bottom line and not even that of course we're going to be in a critical jungling landworks red bus leave eggs and can it be bad to see if it has to take well there we go that's what the size 4 decode it does make a lot of sense because another thing that we agree to this but that is 0 XP entirely for the kale again from Lakewood because it can impact lives to return time and actually he can to help support this still going to be able to get to replace the one downside you do see if lanes blocked this was the chain that was made to make green salsa less likely was the Ritz take half or not in bottom line they're still getting some money out of this one so the penalty for late is Les Gold or gold level one and going to struggle to find my phone all of these crates impact in the game is just being able to feel fine now we can't stay with the red bump with glacial augment this is actually a difficult and I feel like to be able to play ya a plus for me 40 L on this early game strategy just the fact that they decided to rain swap knowing the dumb one isn't that drilled against it because they actually showed on their the warden jump make an immediate adjustment they could have but they were slow to it not rain. Completely charged with the first three waves of the game and Karrueche la300 gold Advantage II start and not only does it take me to get to Zion but even the players are playing unusual Rose nuclear is now essentially a top laner play no one gets impacted by the way has thousands more experience in a game like this and you got nothing to decide which is either on the last thing I do want to mention about is the fact that isolates the Midland now this is the area of the game with Olivia is so vulnerable she is so slow away player at this stage is also black and she really does struggles in the early stages especially if you get jungle brush up towards that lane will the ability to split the map give Jenson a size is the length of flight Awards and now if I'm up to was that level think he's going to have to teleport available has completely negated the area of the game that you want to attack this mid-length I don't think there's a fun as Siri is recalling onto a Warren eckery not looking like he's going to try to stop that one so TL going to put themselves back onto the Box Light 2 on to another the pickaxe in some extra Mana is there for deadlift back so if the Yasuo broadcast can reset in the bottom when it'll mostly be okay for them at 410 from TL off the start that would not be able to get up there and I sing of the cake for this very potent early game will see with the recall is coming out a nucleus with that I can still Force around the objective of looks like that one has scouted and Barrel wants to be able to get some control go team sitting around right they ever in Traverse Town Stephen spawning a lot of this one and steam liquid make their way over you can see double Authority pushing in the bottom wave in Farrell the only one here to absorb any that Farm open so far in these first 6 minutes are sitting at the head will see if they've content this cuz Jesse needs to put the wave out in the mid lane. They might decide to fight his even though kills only little for a little bit scary 1000hp Barrel is around here comes the time can you trade in more impact. He's going to lose his license at 1 pick up a 441 as well as the Drake has not moved and they take everything away from the liquid that went pretty much as bad as it possibly could have per team liquid when you consider that they burn to teleport to actually try and force the fight before but they weren't willing to preemptively 4th to teleport switch. Wood would have stop dog from going for the game well played my dog want to go in the fight actually it looks like the Q from the lease in carbs or by Canyon to expect he couldn't even get the execute on the ocean drink even right here at the end look at this ultimate from Jensen being placed not really where it can get onto Nuku Nuku goes right past it and just destroy it directly to you people ate each Accord night over the back of the pick pick up the necessary tools before they didn't rain gauge as a group I know which is my fight the first time around these teams played one over a dragon one over a rip Harold can you go on the boat and he's already won the first wife out of this game and that's a big game changer when you consistently lose out on this 1600 golden a very early ocean Drake's McClain's even better put the damn one game ahead right now after to really play that if he liquid top plate goes down credit does go to impact that's the lane it still has the gold for himself at a 02 Scion not going to look great and Beyond The Kills and the Drake the kale is the big beneficiary of that fight not we would not have had a way to get gold if mpact didn't leave that late until he level six and a half in that lane also able to get enough gold and a Savory call off so now he's sustaining and kleptomancy and level six of the pale is completely fine nicely 53 CS right they are meanwhile look over to the midline as well show maker who got two of those killed 83 CS highest in the game that man is rich right now and not Corky last picked by the whole top it's alright it's up to me now he's doing a great job of this one's you looking up forced off their bottom through it and more on the analyst desk however if he's roaring so much
give us another good game that lets you select has begun to pour steam switching sides does get flight least I need and pick van having a screaming against each other they went screwy against the other group so I expect different pic coming out this round-robin that we did in the first place so there is a week and a half of learning to dance like boxer the bot and everyone else is doing it was a different game here in previous world if you come in and you play an ultimate app if you don't have the exact read maybe you have a certain sperm group that's going one way I mean Kayla seems to be that takeblvl teams a real famous I having these really terrible raised on the matter of the one of those time Premier jungler world so far that he had a phenomenal black tape beating up a pick it up in the mid and topple and I think the rookie on Jake. He's incredibly aggressive however I already like very aggressive and the progress is something that I used to get most of their Mickey and initiations the first time they played looking across at the jungle Olaf as well seems like a fairly IG specific address World Championship is now not only has like on plated it's what being locked in his first game going to be exciting. Injective grab some magic David Vladimir's a top laner and then some bands make the mastiff look easier could be take me somewhere and I think it when you have a look at the LPL is a Region's aisle with 100% priority to spend all the time when these guys are playing in playoffs they serve at least still seem to pay you for it over the potential make them that you can get out of the car for safety and self-reliance of Zaya he's incredibly High Jackie love that was very consistent throughout LPL summer meat to put in a good performance I want to be take a pic I also don't mind it as the final pick of the first phase because it's kind of forces that work on ban when they're still likely looking to counter pick their final table planer for the shy so that's one fewer toppling Camp you're going to be able to ban looking at the band we might just end up seeing a GP vs. black match up and that's why I asked you end up going for the bottom airbag fuse go to Blind top cleaner is Rumble play it twice so far already probably likely to get the GP on his hip and they've already removed one of the counter picks and Vladimir has available. They can take both right here if they wanted to go to the options right now they do need both so late with Nautilus go somewhere a bit unorthodox locked in for number one I think Mammoth midlane a triple X I don't know if there's anything going to be at some point but it's not very likely I would have preferred to see a rise here but I can understand maybe if rainbow has no Comfort all kind of hybrid tank because of that he's going to be some balance given to this call Arianna rookie has a very good pic or he's mad that Victor stays where it is everything else that is going to be the most standard versus caixa no surprises the Victor a rare sight brackets you know of course we so I can see him but nothing on the Olaf that's enough yeah that actually is the first Victor I just got confirmation that the 93rd unique pick Orban we've had to throw a camping trip started I want to focus in on IG called because we hate me I'm getting me all laughed and Olaf with pushing land is one of the most attractive junglist to pull the post pictures and then when you have a look at the range support into me like this could be nice build a Denny's return to summoner's Rift and I think they're trying to set him up for Success if we look at IG early game in week one or even in the summer split it was subpar and that's completely different than the world champion IBEW we saw in 2018 so it looks like they're trying to return to that for welcome to summoner's Rift 04 not to start the quarter-finals anymore they must pick up Invictus gaming back to their old starting jungler and then they benched him ever since their first round of the LPL playoffs they put them back in the day victory and as we didn't propose I do just want to draw people's attention to the Top Lane Keystone because Wallace this guy tried to Stave off any comparison to notary coming into the world championship he does himself out by kleptomancy Jace instead of the phase Rush Jace that you may see sometimes against the GP if he wants to be able to go in and out of fights can't completely fault them for it though sometimes you get a lot of lanes to stain out of a cup of Nancy which I think is one of the most underrated parts of the Keystone eating and then threatening that game that will come through from probably is a. Yankee jungle I think it's bad to say in that Gregor soap dish I know is he's going to be trading heavily needs to have extra tools to be able to pick that sustain up a couple of other interesting case Stones as well we can have a spell book on Victory in the mid lane which is a little bit strange what does lend itself to some feta team flight options he will have to be able to teleport back to Elena's kind of have Victor's kit Works he needs that go too early for them being able to swap over to things like the cleanse and the ghost photographer could be pretty useful Stephanie could be we'd know that it was a rookie who pause ready to see what the cause of that one is but it will get that to you once we get the information out of this one just needs to get to wait a little bit longer that that anticipation building up to wait to see you could it's going down I'm definitely excited to see how this one does pan out again we talked about the last time these teams met neck-and-neck age to have some leads IG had some leave it up to about 23 minutes a very tight game yeah and focusing in on what we'd expect from this early game IG is looking to blow them out yes we've already mentioned multiple times that the early game was in favor of age do the first time around so I can't completely fault HQ for picking a little bit more scaling specifically with the Spellbook Victor over something like an aerie Victor at least have a little bit of fighting Power in lane cuz Brooky Soriano consumer that match up a Jace can also get very aggressive really not to mention having his eye in the bottom line it actually is 3 better early game champion and Olaf so if this game does actually get to 15 or 20 minutes even that would be bad news for idg when we got a note on rookie said it was a mouse issue somebody with sensitivity a we are now getting ready to go from the players of that might have been thought about maybe going to the game very shortly and I think that when you have a look at how he hates you have been able to have a couple of successful against a lot of it as being around rainbow and Alex so having that smell will fix it doesn't really lend itself to Gainesville that much is very interesting for me I want to see how Alex know it's a silly game that he has another Avenue to play around writerly sweeper going to share the XP I should help the swelling a little bit there tengo two-piece level throughout the past way we got to be a pretty big deal for me to stay yell at each other in Scream to try and get that one over as quickly as possible so I think that's interesting because what I've seen from Rookie that makes me think he's back in form is his ability to leave Lane if he doesn't feel like you can get that solo kill and we sort against to yell when he was playing this Ariana into Jensen's akali feasibility of the shell from Impact bottom line on something as simple as the Ariana was certainly a very key factor in that victory running has begun rookie Ortiz play for the rest of the leaves live in a fight with the very beginning of this one has grass and not bad for this one this guy forced to run away but they're going to have another keep it shakes going nice that helps a lot with even though any kids going well through the minions right there but that's always what she pees look to do is wait in that brush to get the early traits I'm a little surprised too shy get decide to run right through there rather than going to save route on the bright side you probably got a little bit of a cold but it cost him with his health bar in the reason that's very interesting to me yeah I got your phone cool in the first sight couple of trades right there early hopefully goes to Wauka have really nicely played that but what I was going to mention is it back to the shop I don't seem to have a wart on the blue box so we notice right now that I like to is popping down that make me think the plank as aggressively as if it was burning through potions isn't necessarily great unless he can get that waive into Target cuz could open them up to things games on this first clear and I'm going to be tracking how nice dinner it's only because one of the big reasons it was rumored that mean wasn't playing anymore is Just Energy with either rookie year the shy and how out of sync the team ended up being all the Wayans wanted to play aggressive all the time being also wanted to get his two and it just didn't work which is potentially why getting in a seventeen-year-old younger like Glee on with beneficial to the team because they could kind of dictate where he passed name's not that type of player usually do I want to see if he ends up actually camping for the shy for instance in this game Alex is down to the bottom River but not going to find a gank for himself a full three camps behind the opposing junglas or nothing with you. Don't get me wrong this is a little too par for the course but they remain up those camps and might see in a couple things up here and he might even invade because that's actually a ghost poro that got left behind off of the early Ward they had on the blue buff so actually skip the Scuttle crab and the blue box to take a look up here and the 22 because it was actually uncanny how is it backed away right there absolutely no vision really just playing the Timex I think what would have given that away is the fact that for them is sitting so much in the morgue on Elena not actually fighting for the priority at all then dropping the W on The Great Wave and trying to push you out so you see if knows that he's the one laying under threat right now playing respectfully playing the match up appropriately and looking for the vision they can collapse on him here that's gone and out it goes this is exactly how we expecting to play that is not a high percentage play he stopped playing is frozen he has no support coming in from at midlane as wealth but he still goes for it now sitting on a ward he's getting so much attention to the tribes Lane already swept that brush before to make sure it was clear overall it ends up being completely fine for ding but as you mentioned spawn already a few Touch N Go place nighttiming their overall though still is a can't believe you can see 25 to 32 and CS that is the early start here for nothing and if they can't respond at Grandpa's up and start getting some more yes there's 7cs that Victor can clean right now for a lot of is helpful he's going to end up missing probably at least one range meaning of this he's already down a teleporter rookie rookie is absolutely dominating it's even worse for Victor early because you get 1150 gold before getting your first augment upgrade and whenever you've had to take an early recall on Victor to go for a Doran you using other lanes not going that well I need you had to play aggressive hold a thought and now that's going to find a song not going to burn this time does Bell's Hill truck down first part of the brackets and now they're going to want to be to going to chase the prettiest actors on Siri where you trying to go out of the gravity field for the move speed but miss calculating the stun duration by a fraction if rookie flashes early he's probably away but he thought that he would be enough to get him to grab his jungle it in this matchup just because this is Nick has returned and I Feel Like This Is Me Badd on not shadowing the lane hot enough that sprays was set up so obviously from Rainbow do you know the truth she is going to want to get that plane is a tarp because otherwise he's going to be denied old he's going to be tonight experience Ming should be that the that's a mistake and you can almost imagine if rookie just move towards they probably wouldn't that too but the lack of synergy between that hasn't running away from his jungle as well so not only couldn't have been closer towards him do you even have the right side of the lane all those would have an options in either way we look back at the state of this game in the bottom Lane and it's about equal in cf4 for Jackal to pick up and so I'm going pretty close to equal Wars vehicle you're not the one that forever this is what priority gives you this is what the ability allows you to do is a jungle of being able to pull over your support and all you can see already rookie acadians at fog of War how everything is very low this could be a bye this could be us rainbow trying to do that instead and finally does knockdown Nick Drake reset
and both of these organizations made it to the semi-finals World Championship in full also won their game on game guess who comes in this one I think is very real and fairly heavy favorite the Cloud 9 is his international team who is never matched up against to do with this setup if the rift Rivals game what place they were all over the place now it's T9 with lavenderall right well I dropped off here as well but they left off the Tiana this is something that we heard from SS earlier than it is a big risk to leave that out the pantheon has been busy 310 fan the respect from the Stinger is bigger than from there and then also the Yas will like it hits the letter of 70. Ruthall right all right I'll still love every time the scientist build it for breakfast one of the most comfortable camping so much resources in the mid game where you have to watch out for it every single time you like and one thing that I feel like you to is best at expressing the go button at the right time and they have given themselves so many tools to do so I can pull it off so pretty devastating 6 / 52navigate social science course good at listening in most matches right being range of course helps the push of course helps and if someone comes in you can buy something right back out with maybe not enough tools to re close the gap body fun to watch 4 Tucson at tends to be a mid laner nowadays but she can still be moved around cuz I have to work on as well pretty risky to get engaged now but the miasma could be used for Yankees and sometimes struggle in these early Laney faces against the all-in power of a Chicana for a Casio kids with levels 1 through 3 can be very very volatile so I would like to set up for himself and then get Kathy strong massive to be favored in the Cassiopeia orifice on in the lampHagar bands going away for the important ones are of course very good stop the engages GT wanting to make sure that their engagement coming through Nautilus no surprise and rakan matchup that was almost always be expected support down there was Joey comes through almost certain in the middle courseworks acting xayah rakan. The bottom Lane but you never know for sure so we pick right now because you speak last night for the Cassiopeia and ristana TWP into the fight on top of a lot of different options also see a truck coming through for liquor if this is something that we saw impact play in tune Aubrey's bladimir and even though the farm fairly well early the atrox does have the cell peeling inability to build feeling the doctor later so can actually stand up to it in the side length of a 5 Seconds to see whether not grand entrance dance from Mickey D's there be a lot of power to have a much smaller minimum Cactus so it used to be that African would just get inside cassiope is rain is nothing catch up with you about it now it's a nautilus to put down all of his CC as well as a ton of pictures on the side of Cloud 9 as well as a scaling DPS press this one is going to be a great one you know as well as far as doing fanchant because they both have considerable means I tells about 80% to 2 what no matter where you are and I'll always come out of the four battle is I think it was back in 2016 people didn't know how to chance do you know why they would try and do the same tempo is TSM but it was a true Stovall team name and they just get lost, and then I have to on the closet so we settled on let's go see knife which allowed them to Jewel so even though the fact that these are both two syllable names but 9 is bigger than 2 but G2 mean while taking their own Bread Basket Englishtown they're heading into the bottom Lane there is nowhere to go with that one all right bladder gets his leafless blew up in this site Flappers passing I just always want to hone in on the new player on the roster and 1/2 impact this early game we're seeing him start on the bottom side of the Jungle and what would not surprise me at all it's a team go for a for Camp clear and then maybe we'll make something happen around the top way clear all those Bots I can't pick up your Red Bluff and then potentially confessed to be 1 or a 2 V 2 around the atrox hbox always going to bring a lot of power in early skirmishes especially against the life of a flat Amir that impression right now with the klepto as well as The Clapper because it's quite a shocking move from the outside to see the North American MVP subbed out in their game against you two as they have two level two or right before do not get straight there so what I think is going for is a sense of all children's music events Karen was the best early-game jungler in all of the ALCS is Diego's is thinking about going through his teeth except actually had even better or the games Ben Spence Karen J Jeff blabber kind of fell apart between 15 and 20 and you goes I think I'm cool down while I was going to walk out camps right there for bladder only able to find anything Bill Walton belaying was a trade I can't help it feel like this is going to be fine with that because now he will have access to that Rocket Jump and ankles won't be able to be able to close the gap on Jana depressed now look at it yet goes back and forth are going to flash lift now in the Keanu use that to make Midland more volatile there a cure for too long wondermix a call that the pressure in the Top Lane is more important than helping Yankovich was God oh God oh crap that's a likely achieved call where ya ankles will say don't worry about it or not because he has a clear and Elena sort of Frozen Tomatoes The flapper has been in this game not only with that are the Gamecocks playing but standing his ground inside the river knowing that Vladimir Rome's down it's not going to be able to match up if licorice on his aatrox come down as well so with this strong level 3 jungler flapper has now taken control over both Scuttle crab and by burning flash on Captiva Zoe and means that Misty can actually have kill threat in this Lane by charging up that 444 W also looking at the Gold already gold 4 minutes and 1/2 inches four-laning it itches little advantage of the crossword 501 destroying this Lane with his kleptomancy only have time to burn to poop even after bladder has gone for that so be really late space for liquor today trucks definitely tricky you are able to kill sneaky in Lane right there and find active fires back after losing 60s in the face going up against power is back with his teleport as well do opting not to go for the combat Summoner in this one and they would have actually been the thing to save himself even with the death of the Top Lane D to deal with in 900 gold face through for a person out and burned a lot of dance makeup light fight again and we see licorice getting a pull him in on the W by everything even if he uses the pool right there it's still will drag him back towards the center of the ability and now he's just trying to buy time for Yanko she was on the top side map to run on over here but licorice land absolutely everything is being able to knock them down without Ransom of passive watching what happened in the bottom line is well kind of catching up since we're watching the beginning of the atrox play see how they end up pulling off the skillet just too straightforward engage on Mickey but immediately on their power level as soon as a golden little for they know they win that Alwyn actress ass and if your skill points very far behind arms to keep them all for a large amount of that return I think you'll end up dropping about 40 gold office. Purchased but will mean that they can apply more pressure in these lands and fire out their skills 54 gold total it's something like that regardless it is pretty cheap and it's a lot of man over the course of time is put good Landing item is worth of the bottom side and Tiki 6 is equal to farm for the most part but they're still playing a board the first to grab an early BS or take. Maybe it's different blade clutch sleep right there from Pepsi is not able to take these all in trade up against nisky and even the poop battle up against him because Persona is going to be itemizing into the void the Rain King Pin Lane and give pretzel Apple ever be able to do the Red Bluff is there but there is just barely was able to escape still deprez blabber for the suppression because this is why I need to see out of him to make it pay off 49th the only way we've ever seen teams reliably be able to beat G2 in the LBC was to attack them in the early to get an advantage over them So Glamorous walk here was to come in and blow the game wide open got a flat so far and he is trying to play aggressive but I need to see more and need to see especially can get some pills on the flashlight number 72 lineup now look in a game State overall remains 1,000 gold difference is the bottom line has very much been perks and Nikki centered here again up10tion that killed a walk away the garbage dumping as well not a lot of harm down there the other side knows what I'm more to put in this popside licorice text as well so here we come flashless licorice why does Britney far away what are you doing right now I don't wonder why
the long time to see if they're over G2 and as we saw G to meet the pretty handily but there could have standing against Cloud 9 we will see you later today that's the battle for me it's really important here in and I want to see them convincing / h k h set it up for us pretty well here you make me hit the emergency in that match against YouTube what are the things that worked so well for them in the lck summer didn't actually go there I think underperformed especially in that really came out to dry as well I want to see him back on some confidence come up with a much stronger performance because a lot of people had him pegged the house is on fire for Griffin after losing to do to if they also lose to Hong Kong attitude but if they are able to write the chip and have a convincing Victory I thinktext the group stage would be much better for Griffin because this team is second in the rectum and never placed below second in the playoffs of lpk stir it ever won the title they lost the best season 3 of each time but they are for sale for 3 Split don't they are the second best team in Korea as far as I can tell he was so we'll see what they could do one of this one a scam for Thursday through the elements had a fairly easy play and run and a very tight game against power down yesterday so we can definitely see them and they're already opening with a lot of power here the singer that we solved in Flex between Mission and unified in that plane State as well as I call you that can move around a big deal for in the plants was putting 3z on something that was powerful getting mission to The Landing phase been through a lot of these different lines here and now they have some the Champions to be able to do itI think it's why to get show be back on that are really achy is Dairy Queen on that champion if the rest of the game around him is still going right I'd like the lease in as well and the wrecks I pretty much I think would Hong Kong out if you have to walk in here otherwise it would get banned outfit to I think the right size of a good answer here into the least in regardless I want crack on a jungle that can have a heavy early game impact for his Lanes the wreck site is going to be it and now I just want to see how France Works alongside its lanes because he had up-and-downs working with those players throughout his tenure here on Hong Kong added where does the sender go because I think Stinger plus wreck site is in almost unbeatable to be toliquid comes through here right now hkt's physical damage done working their lineup unified and expecting any Marksman out of him but we'll see what does come through the union still left up what it's worth the Aaron you become good come through and I actually like Tao Hong Kong attitude waited until Phase 2 to lock it in last game but first phase wristband by gryffin I think make the Gathering you be less threatening because even though the guarantee we can do this massive beat Wall Frontline to can push people around the map without also having some sustained damage the execution complexity of a chain composition raises a fair bit so I think that this is less about taking that sort of stealing often and more about looking for early game Firepower is it the threat Away by Griffin is it going to be something else that can pack quite a punch in the TVThe Marksman band swing out of hk8 is there more they're afraid of I will say viper give an interview recently that said he wanted to prove that you can play other stuff in the bot Lane it already in 2018 as one of the most Innovative lot of weight after patch 811 that kind of temporary relief through the pro game into upheaval so I don't think he have to pick her right now and I think is also keeping the options open to do something different cigarette is a devastating but looks like and you look at scary New Orleans the first name Mitchell krk shift and get you a wavy Leona or away from the central time and makes me think this heart then want to play horse the top side of map again in this gameyou know they could put your Elliott are they have the option to take another day or so later and regular season and it's obviously but is speculation that start with sub down in the regular season because of performance and champions will do much of their game against aside from the fact when he died she be back until he can he still ended with the Hyatt CSD f-15e other player that it did work to put chocolate it's about what do they do not get in that I really like this year with a Scion because of course you lose the landing phase against can take quite a beating in that toppling and then offer some pretty good game assistant especially when level six does come around he can either go for a kills inside of the length scale of 1 to be a super taking monster or use that to runI see what you're saying as far as the heart engage ability of all of them and I think that's absolutely would be concerned about him being a pinata of goal for a touch of that Jace because that is why we stopped seeing toppling tanks all right is going to play the Midway it is very impressive to 122 hope they can pop the center I actually love this now makes me think they actually want to play outside the map cuz you have all that's all in threat maybe just be stored on an island use the kleptomancy get your money because bottling in early levels that you can jump on your phone app on it Griffin one of the most exciting teams to come out of South Korea kept missing World shot at Redemption right now HK their respect the Invaders what is given as a Scion at level 1 just going in there total disaster for gripping a level one more time I mean cracks he's been coming for so long and they predicted this play to come in Blue Hens going to the dive and then absolutely Steelers you just don't do that Blake Griffin does it anyways just so eager to try and get Tarzan some type of early game Advantage they just as you say give up kills to Sion sintra Henley on it and now this you know makes the early game so much more explosive because both of our junglers held on to their flashes UCI missing flapper Toby the Midland on the Azrael maybe a little bit harder to punished but a flash list down bottom side on the naughty list all the sudden it's a lot harder French go forward when there's a lien on the other side both of these teams have the assistance to get there jungles involve down bot Grace Elizabeth missing classes are matched perfectly by the opposing sides with these are volatile to be clear it's in his Harley Flat supports so we'll see what does come through and then sleep for Tarzan was only a spitz to your for crash that he's not incredibly ripped he's going to like instantly complete Warrior so a fairly equal jungle presence here and I actually think that it's not a music going to mean that the early game is incredibly explosive in fact it might end up being the opposite so part of the game plan for Griffin we thought was going to be playing around a top Lee Jace I think I have to pull over with the killing to assist going to spy on his armor stacking may actually prevent stored from being able to get that power how about l212 in this River craft pushed away Landoll Ripper crash was passing down towards that side of the map to who stars in needed to make that play happen otherwise his bottling to be too has to give up all control on top of the two pills they get it's also the added safety for this bottling over Aurelia and our list that goes want to be playing a little bit more aggressively in those engages and just leave it behind in this fight so yes Tarzan goes in but the accuracy of the W shift and then right there red opal Mystic shot there by chovy showing off his mechanics and then they have double Red Bluff has no chance of Escape have to call out because he used to Tunnel forward without middling priority and then he also has to try and clear away award in that he didn't really have the CC he didn't have the escape tools either to try to run away from that fight when it was very obvious Toby was going to be the first one there ready to go for the TV 2 I take a breather check out what this kid looks like right now is I'll be there early lead in early and speaking of early earliest First Blood since 2015 tracking in world history Sol Griffin still badly he wanted to kill see how the game goes cuz that's so far Pretty Fly for a minute and one minute I think the average is going down here for a minute livable goes crazy off of that kill now has completed Sheen up against just the cloth armor there from Mission this is already give you a really good matchup for Cioppino that you deflect wiper what's the irelia to Viper in that bottom line so they could have disarranged advantage in quartz Midland you can already see it building up that's out NCS for Toby and with that more powerful first base of the scene as opposed to something like this year he should be able to harass a lot more because he's playing as a melee Champion it means a landing W's through the prepaid and then stepping up to prop the auto attack is a lot more viable and usually never get to pull that off and Bottom by 3 I got this is more power in his yeah I heard a lot about the back to come to the bottom as well to recharge yeah that was a play that Viper really wanted to make but the fact that crash was there for the counter tank and it was not necessarily extinct metis ended up just dying by going into early enough to retreat it's always going to be a struggle playing these double Mala Fama you mean all the time whenever you go for the altland there's no real Escape there's no running away from it because you do go into melee ranged New York damage here so as lanzino Viper Jovan in Viper was always going to be hung out to dry without minions to try to retreat onto with his que ya and the Drake is going to be set up next but I got a question and you're free why does 3D have a dagger Scion coming in maybe maybe I have never seen this before there's been a lot of difference in the Titanic Hydra there's like a zebra all of them seem to revolve around 80 and health very few attacks police ion have I seen so we will see this is one of the great Mysteries to me right now what it was like you know like that's it I'm sorry we'll see what comes through regardless or die down in CS bout to be there at that is the Extraco coming into the little one so he had it I've been sick the whole time but sore doing his best to go equal in the Scion might I think so much that he told it the end I think the fact that clown. 102 at the Stark actually really inhibits Griffin's overall game plan in this game like yes they did get the kills in the mid lane in the mid and jungle to equalize the gold lamp
stop and then everyone else fighting for 2nd 3rd is really quite different now and JT wants to make a statement that they are the best team in the fruit and honestly it's been a good start for us friends having a top speed out of groups can often be in a pretty easy matchup when you make red semi finals be a first for an LMS Squad will see if I can continue on if there's a lot to play you me and off the bat no surprises there Pantheon of the first prom dress by also no shock I'm trying to figure out what gametes words with ring to the world State we ended up seeing what ended up not working in their first game where it felt like a bunch of Assassins and then were unable to set up any type of fight and I wonder what type of mix up or going to try and bring today because they did a lot of different stuff in the regular season for the game and find snowball wins competition on the International Spacehe wasn't able to have that early game snowball performance still a lot of fans were expecting out of him coming right at ya and I thank you for looking across the rift on today team they might end up trying to play this game much like they would have played a game in the LMS where they just try and extend the laning phase Farm up and then win because they are better and just kind of plate defense against Camis work because I don't think any pork has that much practice that are very good at playing skin look out for here and specifically looking at today seems a lot of good options for them through the draft is there you go that's going to be a strong Flex pecs Alton for food for 4 or Little V but I always have my eyes on him when it is a strong performing super super Wellness Holly in that upset win over f g xin the Rockler with arrows pointing GIF moving for a top player in the mid they making way for zingano support and so you have to expect that he faces themselves be going to be easier yeah and Lil D who had such a good game one up against fpx is now considering the solution vs. KY to match of now I want to talk a little bit because coming to the tournament I was expecting a lot more Lucian stole what I feel like it happened in a few of these grasses p.m. to pick solution with the expectation that can go anywhere but ended up putting where I don't actually feel like you can do that much against Because I Said So in this instance I'm hoping for play solution but we have to see the rest of the draft and it's possible if we see something like a fresh come down into the bottom line around the worldplus interest be super strong to resist even the bottom line because Joanne 1cc that's going to be instant kill once you hit Level 6 on the Sandra so me personally whenever I see those two Champions walked in I want that to be the following options are for Katie I will see you will come through with that one it will be an exciting to want you to wash walls you already know it's a big Tyson Nautilus the bottom side for dominated one that last picture around out this phase money is available here in a collie is the current however and that's going to be locked in her here we know that can be flexible and see where is it going what I like your style and they have more scaling options in the Kaiser they have some engage tools as well with his Nautilus and they're trying to hold on to that don't go pick up a little bit later we song on the closet I actually wouldn't be that surprised to see him hold out even longer especially with some of these really strong toppling Dan being taken off the tablefeels like to have a option did you know exactly the most pick Champion of the World by the overall pick rate of a Collie was only 39% for all of world so it's definitely picking up in priority as we get more and more of these really quality Soul enters picking her up over there looking at Lucian or syndra most likely your proposal I can still see things like a Lucian top Woodson for the bot Lane so theoretically could be anything but gragas off the table jazz on the table here as well and again even on both sides I want to looking at now for Levi in the side of Kansas to secure a very strong Pop please don't go to put a lot of Harry power in both zeros and Levi on the table by the map which isn't all that difficult but it's because we've I love to play for the top fivedive Towers biggest play around a Renekton reckon we's very strong combination these types of tools will give you the power to find these Burleigh place last I checked Levi actually had the highest damage percentage of drummers in the world championship and the highest yes share of genres of the world championships do if they end up going with something like Nocturne expected very heavy Farm push now the bigger question will be is this like a lease swap level 6 minutes. What are the absolute Premier junglers so far at the world championships has been in about half of all the game of plans included now it's happening here for JT Melbourne right now on the Gangplank it's going to be a couplealongside again thanks to the passive burn and you believe the pope with you it's not like at least 10 play around that Lanes Winsted for Honor this going to be much more focused around Pho pho in the mid lane if it is a send-off before bottling we have a lot more pressure as well as aggressive Esports lineup and Nocturne can go to lead the charge in the rest of the team we are going to see them to Hawaii to attack around that area of the map once the levels come through all we have to do is survive the early Lane in power that.is it the next time it could be up against a tireless ality matchup actually then you call him if he's able to consistently Lander trap on a rope but also could be very volatile early and that's it that's it that's where I go for collect mid we just saw the toynbee game basically the guy who probably invented five mini pro play now we have to do is pick it up very volatile as we set your the problem 4th light in this matchup is that he's not going to have the same sort of the Jungle support especially in the early leveled so I don't like you would see a lot of 3 almonds way to max out you do if your W-2 you're just because you do have to be careful of on his Aleve we've definitely do have power especially around level six. Just sits and starts in one more time right here was hoping to find their first win of the group stage here at Worlds 2019 J team found himself top of the group so faron December 6th we go to close out this group for the day if we're two more games of all this one but we'll see what the records end up being a or some striation here is JT man can face offand looking at this day is a full this was definitely one of them or unknown matchups in terms of who would be the favorite especially because it's hard to kind of figure out how strong the LMS is going to be at the school championship we know the flash wolves was kind of the gold standard for so many years except last year we have flash wolves who narrowly missed getting out of their group and then we had two other on that seems you both 1016 only four teams have gone Owen 16 group stage and two of them last year from the same region and then went flash world doesn't qualify for world because most of their team moved way you almost expected j-team to come in and do the same however I feel like J team was one of those teams who consistently was good in the LMS but could never quite get over the Finish Line to make it to world so in a lot of ways not only can they try and get them X Redemption they can also kind of prove to themselves they can compete in the world level 16Catholic summer split their first went out to eat phenomenal but they have always been denied and has been right there with them guys always been getting high in the midline we both was going to be there and then j-team consistently drop the ball in playoffs now how fo fo get his chance on the international stage is going to be really telling for him who has been trying to prove himself or so so long teleport versus claims in the bottom line as well so he can get some of his health back that will actually end up being Alina dinner's cooking all in threat has been burned by slave without actually burning any summer spells on JT into a lot of times can struggle to get pressure in those early levels I do think you have to spend a lot of Mana if you do you want to push up its way into the cell though is going to let us walk away get the last bit of a flash for it and nothing I suppose rest didn't expect there was two level W right there but really ambitious to try and go into that kill and now without a flash to be very vulnerable now Hannah only level to hear walk away but you have a Q gave it away the location was known that Levi's go to Amazon jungles kills this Ward knows that he's spotted on this one and it said to tell you hi. Going Pops I don't teleport on Daryl's yes he does have W but if pot of water to go for a gank there he could have tried to put zeros in a really difficult but unwilling to risk it though it's really hard for rescue on the GPS actually stepped forward and help him put down dammit but she was there as soon as possible and yes it's over ambitious by rest to bring that flash really but I got enough damage on a zero-turn to teleport and now they've killed him without him being able to recall to catch this wave I also think there was so much room do for a fact he knew Hannah like very likely be on that table saw a huge way of pushing in so now so much you're saying in the draft if you probably wouldn't have that window but with only showing on the top side could be us but once he's got to turn tail and run does it. And he pays for gastritis or Coke comes through not losing more than one seminar but both will bring both couch and rubber now that phone bill has lost his flash around the time that he and Levi in the next couple minutes are going to be taking over 260 have to keep in mind to continue kill Brett around that midline on illusion with no summer self they're locked in that hook that was actually going to be hot if it did go through feels like both of these teams came out of the gate strong big punches the amount of early summer spell usage is much higher than you seen so far at the world championship we've seen every game today come down to a Barren play or some late-game decision and this game with the early summer spell usage kind of had the potential to do that in such a way but because Kia had the name and rest and thought I had the toppling we are still at even both not a squad that plays Super Active in the early game trying to kill you Hannah actually one of those the lowest jungle proxy needs in the LMS entirely his Lanes just dominated they were up over 10 CFM basically every single match up drop the regular season and even the other day against 1 + Phoenix this squad 1 through team fighting it wasn't through Superior early-game it came down to four major team fights around objective where little B and focal play their opponents so if they are on even footing dating have a lot of good things to look forward to later in the game right now to Webster game though I mentioned it looking good in the late game sitting around maybe not the worst thing in the world looking out the bottom side small CS difference and you did it again I think Levi will hit Level 6 off of drugs in the Top Lane since he was able to catch actually a lot of experience and CS when's aerosky to that gank so we'll see how sweet ride guesstimating his music has the highest XP camp in the game he doesn't know for sure that he showed but he's getting pinged so yeah they know for the fear which is absolutely telegraph's we can find that perfectly and this was erected
things gragas priority for both top laners and I did a lot to try and protect fudge as he is still new to the LCS a lot of jungle Focus as far as the band of Courts coming through the duty to ban out the pantheon Thalia Olaf triple combo but now with a lot more people playing near that's also going to be coming through that it's kind of Bulge 240v power picks for Jungle do cats wipe them all in first round of bands and a cloud 9 have already showed their very willing this happened year-in and year-out Analysis of the pro League trade good junglers it lets you think there was one that's going to win all the matchups and it's impossible otherwise but the line and they still get to Leah or they still good to eatwasteful I'm not sure if I'm missing something just feels like it's too much going on where the spring slides do you like Pantheon really good at being proactive setting up gangsta getting pills early your Olaf these ones much more powerful I make so I think that CSM showing yesterday that they actually are not a proactive early game team once again that they were set up with all these possibilities and they weren't able funeral to make the early game moves before you apply place was able to get two so such a strong team fighting Synergy for them so I think that's something to look at from yesterday45 minutes straight and as their bands coming through to get rid of one to go with bits in TF and who dere is left up go to Leah is back there as you mentioned is healthy for Str junglers are going to trade to Leah back fruitier than hey you better yourself and not going anywhere you brought out two bands but you're both getting a strong jungler here across the bow in the Cloud 9 side will see what really comes through the end of the day all right now TSM going to hover in a eukaryotic know if you really make a lot more sense down here and I'm going to be in for lost yeah if they are early locking Calista I feel like that does box them pretty heavily into relying on trying to lowball round bottom side around early dragons and that is really hard forces Cloud 9 clap. I have had some of the most aggressive and quickest early games of any team in the league with blabber absolutely popping off I think blabber blabber performance currently is it some of the best that we have ever seen from him so they're going to have to do something to try and contain this jungle generally going to want to get some winning soloplay matchups and white pictures of Camille does leave you open to the Jacks answer once again fudge already tried to use it and Cloud 9 were very willing to send bladder up there early on focus and make sure you can get to at least your level six there where you can ask that the Camille yep look back to Cloud 9 verse golden Guardians yesterday and a blabber level one games he was stupid latest level one in that top played in the end there's a lot of pressure up there as fudge battle biles in the jungles how to make sure that cloud 9 got the better of it you got the easier it as well as soon as possible wrap beer he knows he's not perfect until more bands coming through because you know you lit to Leah go through eighth of the band face cuz that you're not getting the terrestrial yourself so no going with some coverage on his outsideMisfortune I'm thinking of Samira maybe in that list as well to give perk the more control after wave chords Midland this already is looking like TSM showing multiple tools for these very aggressive Thalia Camille Kaiser all look like they want to jump in on stuff you're going to need some guarantee cc to set those up so gallio is a really smart ban hear it from from cloud nine you take away the combination Camille galio plus another Global that you don't want to have to deal withalrighty Rock there is a Galea gone we're waiting for the second and out of TSM as we want to see you what bottle and they're trying to hide and protect against with of course they would have first dibs on the support pick as well and that means with us Rush band they get to grab the board and then keep trash off the table as well work by the way just by the fact that I think people often think of him as they actually His Highest win rate Champion among his top 6 most place is right this is quite bad it is one of any Midland I can see what rate is very highwhat is the REI always tries to ride street memes but not great draft strategies always but I think that it was late day of already committed to this Jacksonville match up topside and as beer is is very selfless minutes. He has his own escapes built-in Wave Control really well you protected with the oread have been as well so I think Brooks is set up to be very good for the squad moorgate that's how I talk about Hearts CC long-range here and gauge for Sword Art he's supposed to be the one to pull the trigger for TSM I signed him to this team they've drafted around so many possibilities of picking people off your with the Leonardo added on top this one has to be action-packed yeah so Miss Fortune elsewhere comes through and there is a small concern by The Misfortune being grabbed because look at the opposing lineup look at thatDSM exact situation we're lost didn't get to have any fun playing Miss Fortune against the Camille there's some follow-up in DeLeon. There's some follow-up in the Thalia there's even in the case of a needs to be before she does not tight away easily games yet well done does goonie delete you is going to be a question I have asked if you could have just gone Sia write could have picked it up at the option to just immune the knock back or UNCC from you in the cage or anything and private he's like Donna. We're going to be off with the birds were going at math and it's going to work out so I want to make it work that night there's an important difference here is that Ben has an Al estar which can a head but the Camille back out of her own hextech ultimatum so that it breaks it and he should be able to live if your bodyguard Alistar that that you can foryour Misfortune really going to be up a lot to use vents play Kobe but I wanted to weight loss had an Alistair to okay I want I want to be clear on something that has not had a good year on TSM okay looking across the LCS so far this year speaker has been the best player I think Pee-Wee's been second best wins order came in like this was the guy was replaced dierksen is dominant player to ever going to look to you as soon as we built around him much like direction for 6 years straight was the Midland and the LTS support he has the worst kid on the team gets worse kill participation on the TV is not getting things done he is dying and not helping things happened sword art is not having a good 20 21 on TSM coming just off of World Finals appearance I need to see him step up I want to see what else he can do in this game he's got some Leon it it can look good but I need more of that player Ultimate Ears or freak is going to lose his mind let's take a look he's coming out of the bass a little later they do have a swap over to another sweep or double sweeper opener for TSM that smells possible late invades then well you know speakers the right Champion for what the rocks are cooking and blabber can I have to buy Rockaway the sweeper does not find a wart though I love patience real life you know tsmc sweepers a lot we're going to wait on our Wards let him go for the sweep cool we can work afterwards I hate that we do see that the attempt their sweep song forward Sword Art going to take his down to the bottom side to but then you when you have a support going sweeper this early on dropping the The Ward and then switching over that really does kind of give away bottom side Focus if you're investing in offensive trinket at level 1 then you really want to make play so they're going to put it put it right to the test immediately freaked your price tag on Sword Art and see if it is worth it here because I expect speaker to get down there and try and take advantage of that we are is taking Crux as part of the clear so it's going to be the full 6 camps most likely want to point out that he is doing the exact same flash list Camille now. And you know done the exact same you do fudge flash done black bear slaps and hope they have enough but regardless of how much more we already saw who he learned to use it as part of the least show didn't take an escape to it all meant to be okay though she's going to you since we first defensively under his turret theoretically to be a very hard drive all things considered and either way he's going to get his XP and now has his Escape Plan a pretty sure yeah I mean you can just keep W spam trading the early stages versus the Jacks Just landing gear outer cone of w trying to get off the Q not over committing to it unless you're able to be out the Counter Strike otherwise pledge will have the last say about its platter just power clearing as normal no no kind of variation Sierra can easily finish a flowclear before Scuttle spot us one of the big reasons why is rosan it to prominence should be able to finish up on topside give fudged the full extra Comforts of knowing that they've got crab as well as what that scryers or pop top bottom side to no surprises for either team they know speakers down their bottom side is not really in danger of a dive on cloud nine separate either has Red Bluff plus details and burnt going to be knocked down the rest of his rights start the sax going clutch going to find himself with the stun know he won't come to Bear can you get in the way to flatten up locket stop playing so Good by blavor you have to interrupt your meal after she gets the hookshot connected to the wall just flashes a right to the spot where her a little sore legs are sticking in the wallet is able to bear slap her down but I thought this was a pre-emptive and he's not able to get the hookshot out early hoody kind of fish tossing it out but sticking around after he did the Deep Ward on enemy cruggs patience pays off freak blabber strikes once again and this man has just been outstanding for cloud nine he is such an outstanding player that game was awesome it's the most Telegraph play the jungler should have bought side he's going to take Scuttle it's perfectly in regardless though Cloud 9 by also love to see when toppling is get punished for not bringing flash where are you know either there are junglers doing it where the graves at night bad for a while oh yeah I've got to dash in my kit and win my duels it and you you kind of flex on people in a one V one of them in and they cry when you don't have your flash for instances like we just on the top side but attacking top laners that go that route and try and try and get the ignite so they cannae go on your one-v-one so they can turn your wife you want a ride is is kind of I know it's satisfying to see at a certain level especially I do for a for the top laners that that don't go play ignite and I know it's very common now but it's seeing faces Alice's dye-free 6 or like you could go after shock and younes Abboud how to hold her eyes but she lets go out of Mana GBA ROM PS2 that big one hitting but you just got to sit out no problem there and it is going to be cloudy tonight starting at the dragon because of its he's right back into midlane there as your has priority Vulcan even goes for the tray to keep tsm's bottom lane from fishing around and the day or going to be grabbed Midland pressure it's going to be enough yet the first EP obviously quite relevant there so bladder Smite ban okay early ocean Dragon submit it's in pretty good start in your Cloud 9 should feel comfortable cuz one is going obviously the first one of the top one is great and the lanes too much everywhere
friends as well as in players who have a lot of potential as up-and-comers here right now they have licorice is kind of their big star this guy I think over the last two years in the ALCS has been the best top laner overall in an a note Perry met alongside some of these C9 Academy guys we've seen so many people coming through as two can be great and they're hoping that Johnson and Diamond Powell Foxy's know these guys that are young players obviously. The weather in the LCS are all going to be able to develop and and make this a really strong roster last year afro is going to be the primary care to bring up these other players fake God in Philly go play together on both Air Academy debuts now the rain here back on the LCS stage you know they put a few games and alongside asked who had Pinot Neo now of course you only had a very good game as well and right away I was also one of thepoints of dignitas the other player kept around from last year did early big potential for a very quick picks already has been so high priority in ProFlame bar in the new season 20 21 no really strong especially in comparison alongside a lot of these Harding age before that we're seeing in the bed I were seeing a lot of Lyon overseeing Alistar even things like Ralph who can actually set up for you to dive in and utilizing gale-force it does seem to work very well for that aggressive play Renekton plus Thalia Point click CC for the Thalia to fling you in with that seismic Chef that is very dangerous for any top layer that is going to be going up against them so fly Quest already going to have to try to decide do they want to try to play towards and match has to be too or you just going to sacrifice licorice hope that he can survive as best we canto be over all of you if he was picked up at the 4th but you got to find a way to answer and survive Renekton to Leah bruculino Fighters will do so you probably play a tank I want a nice things about being or awful during the Duffy which means you can if you and the Tulia shop every other CC will still land you'll still be done if you can still be flown or silenced they'll still kind of take effect but you will not be knocked in Viera push back sew safer ant if you can go for a licorice his wife being the guy who currently want to be on a carry at your foot against one of these Jungle Top Lane combos that can just destroy you you're not going to have a fun time on a lot of turtle now finding out quite a few of these supports galio certainly hasn't played as it before in this season no point click c c r a for Kaiser but it's also very strong force in the RSO training bands back and forth your Alistar is band out as well fly quest to ahaven't been out to Yahoo just been popular in 10 pairs well with the Leah to build a play heavily towards pop side of this does live leave Leona up for flyquest if they wanted to try to play to Ward that so it will be interesting to see if that does get faded out but didn't cost at least for now not too worried about it yeah when you see what the match up to going to be here of course you know support and midlane are the roles left off in this but I do something funky and thin rice per second do flyquest going to be looking at Palafox pick maybe and maybe she'll be saving their support for last time ticks and it could be a very very obvious team fight composition Oriana likely will lose the Leona over here to aphromoo that is one of those really high priority pics down in the bottom Lane work incredibly well with Samira point-and-click PC with that stunt American Odyssey follow up with the Nock up on NECC targets with can set up for all in very very effectively and you own a again here find out what Diamond wants now they have given him last pic and so we're have to see where he take us as far as the supporters' go Rel I really like it has been out quite a lot of it works both had to peel an egg age you can be a follow-up on the Oregon gauge you can also dive in and one of things have been really unique with the Kaiser combo is that you can apply the plasma with your alternator with some sort of CC like a flying over top 5 Second dive in and then on that same ability to fly the flag of the ultimate is also kind of peeling for Kaiser once she is altered in because you had that little man pulling them in and helping to protect a boar hurt the first downs of this really really exciting for Sorella the LCS I am very high for it I really thought it was well I'm glad you're basically ever he was doing go for a 2012 Challenger 2013-2014 took a break for a few years came back with the scouting grounds 2017 from their bam on Siena Academy be like one of those came back while I'm glad to see you finally get his shot on the LCS Asian glad he's going to be the one originating Darrell here in the LCS also it's going to be fun watching the one side of course you really got you Leona Gravesend Kaiser login look really good on the flak Westside outside though it's still looking pretty spicy as well I mean you've got you and I we had some hits and misses from Perks like he got first blood and then it kind of fell off from there but two very good lanes for a Tulia to gang Kavanaugh Rihanna's pretty squishy has no inmate escape so just like the Q3 from unit that's a setup that's a guaranteed kill if you don't flash it so there's a lot going on in this game very aggressive very exciting Sidelines the one side and an obvious team fight comp on the other we are on to the rift here for game 4 of the day has ticket office flyquest are going to Duke it out to be a good one I'm very excited for it as you say but you're going to have that obvious team by cop on one side on the other other r a lane that they can try to play through very aggressively I don't think so they can get out into a 131 and pretty comfortably with this style of composition you have TP as opposed to ignite that we sell pork steaks or so legal in fake God could be looking to play towards the side lengths half. Rocks moving around the map roaming with aphromoo trying to create pressure you also can have you know dardoch Neo and 1/2 remove your kind of holding down Bent Lane as the three in that 131 so I do think that there's a lot of ways for them to play this out but when you are going to be South compositions it to it depends largely on you doing well in laying right you're playing slow push from behind is incredibly hard because the winning team by team will just show up two objectives and constantly forced air force you to respond or just fall further and further behind so we're gonna have to see how well they can talk and laying up against like was to you have so many great ways to set up here and I talked about the relka the combo but also real set up incredibly well pulling people together with the magnetism on the ultimate for orianna shockwaves you have great long-range engaged both with a r l is Wells the Orange Soap really really deadly double Marksman see if I can come up here not going to be the red leash as expected there and garlic is in a kite down towards frogs this is also to expectation last hits it down burn from your jungle item does not kill Buffs and so by waiting at my second saves a full-on attack which is that going to half and at them having a faster clear so nicely done by getting a chicken's here is going to be slower released plus it's Thalia she has this really really absurd single Target Camp clear so that is going to be a jungle leave for dr. Leon we'll see how it manifests you talk about laundry once I wanted to bring something up bushes I definitely think compelling as well which is it going to be a lot on co2 keeps the engagement from happening as Samira because if you could stop Oriana's keep you from being like a ball for being in rain still in shock from hitting either so either because the timer engaged couples are all stuff by Neo kind of doing the blade swirl that well it can be extremely powerful but if you can force that out you know even just a little bit of Chip damage or no threatening with AQW from the Oriana then there is a fairly lengthy cooldown that you can look at finest with you or an LT or some other form of the gay so I agreed you I was going to have to be good with that really tracking cooldowns of his opponents and making sure that you're not wasting at w by any means this is going to be like a lot of pressure on him to be playing well you know you talked about aphromoo & Johnson obviously playing against his former teammate afro and Johnson I think were not the brightest spot really for didn't often in what was a top split your previously they became of pretty darn strong pot Lane afro they're going to be hoping that he can again no playing alongside Neo here get something similar performance-wise out of him you know as what he did from Johnson and if they can train him open and become a pretty powerful to be doing that bottom side if Sally go and fake God can really develop alongside Dart off then thing to start working for dignitas but if there are really tough to the LCS this split it is definitely one of the teams that people are expecting the last from that are going to be hard pressed to enter to really match up against all these very top teams going to happen recently finished drop by about 3:10 and had the chance to go for Scuttle instead look around topside so if it award and took down the first half of drugs but in what do you want most is on the small minion and then you just saved me 1200 damage and I still got most the gold we take those and honestly I'm not sure I feel like he doesn't least I mean it might be a situation where he was getting a little bit nervous about his positioning on the map and it takes a little bit away he still Sandra tree back and he did take that Scott also hopefully for him he's going to go to pick up more of these camps afterwards. Looking to put a little bit of pressure here does this amount so we'll back it up but no with Alex around they was happy to take any fight if it did break out play nothing happened right now you got a 12:00 CST to the topside us because going to take his first recall the game Palafox happy to get here picked up to there as well honestly any first recall for any man I can just pick up to your vulva tear upgrade to a few of them the two of them very very good so pretty, to see that won't happen events at his house functionally infinite Mana once every call comes through and you buy that for when I go buy them they'll Palafox going to have a lot of push priority already had a farm leave so that it forces you don't feel like driving to email and then I kept and not getting any up some self just yet finally matched it so you can see a difference as he finally goes back to his first two items down there goes a call when you're just getting constantly poked out in her early on to cool. They're very long for you and I so it can be difficult if you can't actually threaten any sort of all day and you have to pick up much is Dan yet you can get bullied in these matchups how to staunch the bleeding no keep it dies a little bit more even from here on out we'll see what his first by was just going on. Send these spells from Palafox and you'll be able to move around the map country little bit better I already woke support back in the lane now is they help NX I pick up the first dragon the game no flyquest so far so good you noticed that the jungle on The Blacklist start do you want to be around bottom line in time at 5 minutes to make sure you play for the dragon make sure that lane stay safe since Rell and Leona could be such a volatile late as we seen Dark Side of bottom side bangs for round two of the drugs but now there is an engage Liquors wants then they will not find what is licorice classified his own stunts. To actually help to deal with a Thalia so even though you have that armor you're still fairly squishy against actual do loved our talk and fake goddess loc knows that it's hot winter still has priority does get his flash Force but happy to move in invade to Legal have pushed out mid so they have priority their Palafox and looks like was on a recall or perhaps just a little bit more defensively back so a nice little bit of a play up around that top side of Durock at least as far communicating and playing pretty well you have to stay with his sole length as well Flash the flash on for Johnson was afraid of two senators from Africa put on rock and they didn't get the flash out as you say but it is a trade afro though is going to be 6 here pretty soon and McClendon flash down on Johnson there is the potential for an all-in play and I would like to see them look to attack that event Summoners down on Johnson see if they can get a kill their especially because know when you're playing this style of bottling is Diggs how to really do I want to be playing from ahead senior in particular you're in my experience it is is a marksman that can feel Unstoppable when she picks up a couple kills but largely feels pretty ineffective and just kind of worried even form style games yes what you guys are primary builds are right using the or the early components of shieldbow I think you have options kind of everywhere but she'll do is the most common because everything you do. Supplies lifesteal so it's a really good stat for her but if you're going to get one shot by you know what grades are in Ariana's like you can't lie still while dead so you know you do you have to be somewhat ahead is your mentioning right uniform doesn't make you the hard carry it's the first shut down and suddenly now you're going to feel good about your damage behind everyone else is based on
have their work cut out for them spy certainly a very solid team why would not describe them as explosive Oriental early game action they have a great fundamentals and they are very thought of you allowed them to get into their group and that really is about fighting Round Table a late-game set up around there and they are a strong team in that regard highly aggressive skin deep valley game and shoot point on a Tappan and on something like the Cassiopeia can also take it to you in the landing phase as well and I think the day of the areas of the drop that I would prioritize if I'm supplies we expect to be on a scaling fritztile Katy Perry but I want to see Jessie and humanoid be able to take it to the mid to be too and maybe even try and help that although I may end up with everything going to have to really step up here you know someone who I've been receiving criticism throughout the plans for not necessarily really performing not to the level that he was expecting and he's going to be going up against Taro soupincredibly strong player one of the best sarm is region and I'm looking for himself in the International Date Casey the current Opera we was being in that pasta 5S as you all well free dance goes with every single game and now if you really want something like a gang plank you know why he's going to have much more freedom to play his style of League of Legends in game Packers game time card engage locked in for a slice of brackets in the jungle Nautilus down and support and meanwhile Freightliners here for game with the Tristana top or mid laner and then we have to show me your analytical proud it is really hard to know right because this is a team that can really throw a wrench in the gearsare going to play a mage bottom getting cinder box or stone in mid and a colleague. I would be my prediction doesn't mean I'm going to be right on even a single one but this is a team that White Plain on saying if it likes to challenge you and I don't think that it make sense to put Tristana in the bottom Lane and and play a scalar against the likes of coffee because that is his game and and gametes play Greta Van sole interest on a can do that. Because I think they thought that the Gangplank was going to come Mossman Gangplank and Minnie not also doesn't deal with them very well either so I would expect there'll be able to pick that one up exactly right you got to throw everything out the window when you think of that game going to think about how they going to attack the lane as opposed to how they going to make it to team fighting right because they do do that you very early and I honestly wouldn't even be shocked to see them go for something like and ignite dress right you know these are the kind of place that they are willing to actually go for a TriStar with ptak is a very strong leaner and any real rage masses can be a difficulty 4 games like in the early gameI can be knocking down those barrels and if you do want to go super aggressive and look for something like he might look for these early aggressive Blaze IDP can be a threat you know even free 6 1304 Gambier is the kite the anxiety bog-standard Marksman carries the bot Lane already off the table here in this role if we want to go for Cassiopeia actually use the drop off there after he played really nicely only a tankless lineup show that use going to be bred from the akali and if you don't get on top of them they will just wait and I also raxiom really think this intelligent given the style they are going to bring forth right you know what we know is going to do all this crazy stuff we're not sure who's going to be late to play a defensive Marksman play a marksman that can scale up that can play some what's safe and survive you know that early stages because I do things by themselves up in front of the Wild for the later you ate the last pick to grab the mid laner most likely here can still be flexible. These acacian as L'Occitane how do you say you like the scaling do you like the fact they going to have any pro activity in their Lane it going to be on humanoids to generate some form of pressure he he will go towards a LeBlanc but I feel like so much of this I really gain what kind of pushing to be like in otherwise the map will just collapse that is generally how they do actually play it out in funnily enough we may end up getting it just thought of it and if I actually was right that I'm shocked but you're certainly some ability to actually bought these rounds and it is going to be non-standard right is going to be syndrome playing in the bottom Lane would be surprised if they don't remove the dress up to the Top Lane but you certainly you can play that is very effectively and if you are going to be able to get the Bush on the Block you can threaten those to replace it is actually going to be to set up here so volleytalk Tris mid-century bought yeah I'm in regardless I don't think any of these lanes are great blockchain reveals through cell so that lock your players around none of those feelings are great for her I put dangling advantages well we can keep in mind is that even if they are putting up against the game plank anyway, because Wally Greek Holly doesn't have any of the most dominant matchup you can survive a lot of them but certainly Tristana is very threatening not into that DP for half so they're feeling it's a little bit too dangerous Summoners War Rift Oasis we close out day one of the worlds group stage for the battle between gametes from the LEC is it going to be a very interesting battle number one team in Vietnam number three from Europe play fighting the regional qualifier the short run to the playoffs but made them work for it and got away two worlds got through the play in stage as well Gamo very strong team Chrysler playoffs putting you out together this split swapped into new players are role swap to more you look so what's up I normally use for my set jol is an absolute mess everywhere to separate support find free games each throughout their playoff run as well however they didn't have a really good split once I found any form of consistency in their lineup in you know just to continue the narrative essay also deal well with a tile style League of Legends it had low-key trying to throw all the questions at them as well so this is a team that not only played really quick and explosive himself but once I can deal with it very well in the 80s is that slow down the frustrations dialed has been they know their kind of play style for quite some time and no they do is going to be as crazy as gam but there are extremely proactive very aggressive like G2 that they are having to deal with him and honestly they have not until well with them but the question is is gam of that caliber are they able to new run over twice in the early game like to meet other great LEC to use can do it's almost impossible to actually fight back into this we are seeing jockey though and handling the stop playing pretty well utilizing grab that she poked out zeros in Terrace really just need to get the wave in the Torah and basic needs to get a reset off your and that is why you trying to shut the hell up here he knows that there's a could be in and this is actually a pretty difficult spot for him he's putting himself at risk is he's killed just yet I have to go I have to self waiting for that cool down is the blues going to be taking Levi is around C's okay in the river so you can burn the W that's why I wasn't allowed in the burn the spell energy trying to complete that shop in this could come around that she would have seen as far as though they were watching Levi new side that we now see the Cosmic Pegasus I'm not going to be any engagement through the back side it again jumped over takes damage map showing himself to think a little bit of arrangement in a gross or didn't fully get into the turret in the dip with zeros in a pretty awkward spot but it's going to be able to be comfortably pushed in Leakey I had so much fun at Camp Lucy sides of the map and being a big impact that's why I thought you meant we would go something very aggressive obviously LeBlanc wants level 6 does rate should have killed for it on this Tristana but we press the attack with a knife I feel like they should be a very good Lane bokeelia and certainly can be in and honestly you can post 6 if you're willing to itemize for the match of go over things like in early next Rinker it can be difficult for the block to actually have enough damage to pull push through that Shield you know until you are going to further on into the game and even talk. He's running going plating right he's got some defensive stats in here as well for the route of the MRI as well so it is a choice after all of course is feeling like Chris and I are going to be playing in Temple Emma and I think that you know this has been a very standed include early game so far. Flat bread bought was stolen away but now we put it in boots outfit available you would expect that I say to look to make his first real meaningful impactful gang on the map as long as you keep your flat and have predator on Disney the unrivaled with the amount of damage do you bring through these early case, because if you are the ones that are the site off and is kha'zix is there to actually you answer that game by the since early births down in August so incredibly fast and that is that Levi is going to be looking for these isolated fights in these fights where he can actually answer and how people can of opting in and committed to it and then look for the engaged play against midline priority right so you have to look at every single fight and kill them before he is room is there and it's a losing fight so every time he goes from one of these days one of these Shadows he has to know that she puts the Ulta on in and out the following Audi's going to go watch The Flash this project completely sold out the dragon on the other side of the map and getting ocean at 6:30 so big for your laning phase it almost gives you like a get-out-of-jail-free matchup this is to be feeling very very good really across-the-board impact Cassandra that's one of the weaknesses of the early game off the bottom light Mages and assure that certainly doesn't and even for the akali and of Champions without man of people often look too and say all right we'll do it and doesn't really do much for you, but in a map where you actually have the bush you can absorb the poke your from GP while you're actually spending all your energy thing to try to push it out and then simply backup and Regent you know with that ocean Dragon so certainly nice take away I'm just going to feeling good this early on a really cute directly to look forward to go for on Orlando would it be named after the candidate getting out of Lane and making sure that he's supporting the other way and he's also on a really good timing on call Desiree sense or no Nation the bottom line what kind of fluidity that we come to you know what you expect to be led by here early on we haven't seen more more what does it more item upgrade looking to get more gold generation in the early games of e3 is going to have to try to make some plays to justify this by instead of just upgrading for your Target on since you have to think of how Pike whoops map State and what he was actually being able to do it so Noble support they want to go generation because so much of a goat is face off the back of that. That's going to be really much of anything is he still too far away to get him anyone else but actually getting to right out of that. Now the top side walking away traded blows everywhere that humanoid down the 2/3 but hit me hard as well and very careful here learn the facts going to stay alive is the across the ocean now kicking in so he is going to stay in backup quite quickly during the song that you could be proud
I think fun plus talk about them in the play crazy stuff for the end of the day they still have really good team fighting game they got lwx I've got game to call the shotgun mlpl because he is not afraid to dive in the back of the spike and absolute takeover team by team won the most aggressive late game team Fighters I think you are going to see at this tournament and the fun places in incredibly frightening team do their snowball 15 when they get any sort of like licking humans over on this feels like one personnavigate to 20841 Kiva world right now for things like that and I think that it is a shame that people are going to quickly fall in love with despite if you haven't seen them because he's every role we going to be throwing at you know unique characteristics and I think the last thing I want to mention gets how well they dive tour it's early this is a team to level four. I think the event it right it's because they give you no time there's no hesitation they're going to be for men flashing on you in immediately killing someone off before you can actually turn around to play but on the other side certainly both of looking toget things done here for jtm he is the standout player and don't be while he is an incredible mid laner he's he's last known for his laning and that is where if you are dating I think you were really hoping they can start to get some advantages off the plate first of all like these Deport pick us where as well as they take out the carries himself aggressive pod spitting up in TN credible incredible jungle is he was going to grab split squat shopping bottom line we already talked about the fact that he's one of the best way for the pairing however Timberland field as wellTerry Reid on kind of the matter on how they want to execute around it has been used only a problem for the Raging in the pot, but I don't think your team sucks as much from that concrete to take acrylic Clear Choice cannabis garden locked in these I hear as well so Jason have a pretty standard body composition BlackRock control good engaged to Kerry play the swap from 80 Terrace is very young and he's kind of an emotional by I've been just drive to and from all the people that if you get behind if you thought the struggle in the elegant can get lost on summoner's Rift does need somebody to get from my phone will gravitate around at midlane and I feel like that's kind of against the grain of how they saying they need to be able to give me Hannah the best pics of a 10 for him right now does place was that style it certainly does the TN on the other side you know he's going to be having this to lease an early-game Powerhouse certainly one of those topics here fixed someone who can do to facilitate the odds of that likes to do but certainly deserve their do they were one of those dominant teams we have seen you coming to the elements in a very long time absolute Crush summer split the whole entire game just because it is such a long split did you guys still play best of braids are there is multiple David to be able to create that outfit but most likely ETA when they ask you to the LMS Stephanie Curry is going to be with us for the LMS I think the last 13 months have been really really disappointing is dying it's locked in for the minutes before I made a bad choice and a side of mashed showing at last four Championship JT trying to lead the charge you to say no LMS we are still good will be they can make that happen here is locked through I think they're pretty good I think it's certainly possible you've heard from dovey you know they could be going up the game again certainly igp band out that is his most played you're doing be most played for him he's actually the rides they certainly targeting the soul enter there was j-team I don't be kind of known for some of the Innovative rise builds no kind of pioneering things like this and righteous Glory rise and sing the rylai's as well trying to play in The Silence can be one of the best in the entire tournament is not the best week I talk later in the tournament so certainly would not be shocked to see him put on that Scion if they want to save some sort of immortal InFocus pick here for don't be in the midline is still one of those ratings it has boots black of hot carry top laners and then wait till I tell planets and I do agree with you you have a look at people while I wash laundry and I think I know he is certainly play this quite a bit in the LPL so that would make it very likely no amidst ionic is fossil is a science report galio mid hilarious and black thing that could come out here but I am expecting is mortiser to go top here working goon willing to call a different back to textures will be Fofo could do lots of karaoke Los I'm supposed to be 20 seconds left still think about they want to there's Maybe This Island gallio swapping but it's an LPL special honestly and so much damage is going to come out of l w x and his I thought you know I already feel like we are going to be seeing those four or five been following plays a likely seeing him good play weak side of the map going to be pushing out and grouping up with them looking for man plays out of the word that bottom side we're going have to see our little B and koala able to withstand that amount of fracturing are Hannah and Fofo going to be able to match those were actually allow it so it level six she is under threat a little bit more because I specifically very often in desire has an order with white Nike but I have the feeling like you know we keep building up the walls it'll be really embarrassing if I go to topple game now welcome back to summoner's Rift Funplex Phoenix if it's your first time seeing them buckle up it's going to be a pretty quick ride potentially what are the very strongest teams in the world they lost a single match this split across the LPL they won regular-season in Spring they want regular season in summer they finally won the tournament in summer here as well incredible incredible Squad incredible players there are a great team and LTL has been waiting to join be to be on the international stage for such a long time will also take you through the fact that JT is the similar situation 12 throughout regular-season smashing through those up playoffs as well 31 pearces HQ in the final Bitcoin be played with Swift and then finally found his way to FBI and it's always been going to be throughout the regular season of fantastic performances this guy is fluent in Mandarin he's a fan favorite and he's always stumbled to make it to these games National event well that will change this split pairing with TN this year was just such a great move because he had depression is finally dead and we finally have a similarity you to be able to play around which I don't think we've had definitely agree you know they have been working credibly well together either Synergy it is very impressive to see and it's it's also I think that is working very well for then you can see don't be actually going for that spell book is something he often does on Nautilus as well and looking for a swap over for things like you tonight for more kill pressure when he is looking for those to be too sore move down toward the bottom side and they also want to talk about a little bit is this more to Kaiser vs. Gnar matchup in in the early levels it can be quite difficult for the mordekaiser but posted there certainly is the potential to actually look for solo kills because women are is actually on know that kind of exhausted state where you cannot get into Mega and you Altimas mordekaiser he's a locked in with you in with those lower base stats without the ability to necessarily Caillou around as well it certainly looked really punish that dive champions in the game we just makes every scenario 1 B-1 right so if we think he's going to play out in the fashion that we seen so many FPS games play out during the regular season begin ability to cross that trade against them it's so crucial where to watch but certainly fun plus I feel like it's the likely formula is pushing the middle and going down to the bottom when getting your shotgun is loaded and getting him a couple of shells to plasti folding squat he was going to fight in the bottom Lane right there though and how each one of them is towards crisp really nice little trade their from JT and I was like the timing of when they backed off you know if they are to stay in too long is it up it'll do exit able to talk of passive it there then the tree can really even out also a good quick trade from JT man that is going to help them have priority on this bottom side Scuttle on a knows he has really move from is battling if there were to be any sort of Challenge from an area where Hannah is showing kind of the fact that he wants to be able support of the side of the map that we think is going to come under Fire there's no point being able to go to world's top Lane if you think that immediately the trade is going to be down bottom to the additional resources in God I've already spoken about this but as a jungler so far behind on experience and levels I think that this first part is being able to assure Ralph what should be now a level 6 on Gavin and the ability to impact a map if you run into a lease early game especially when she has Redbox she can be such a pain to deal with being able to navigate that successfully and there's always going to want things we like to talk about his kind of the pressure on a lease to make of the game plays Eliza Champion that he want to be proactive with that you want to be making things happen in those early levels and not necessarily dedicating as much time as some other jump close to farming where is Jarvis is going to be completely happy you're going a full tank Ralph Tiana just able to actually stop the recall they're really annoying because don't they use his helper to get back to Lane mobile has no teleport so that is actually going to cost him some gold and especially if they want to be did elective to allow some of the minions to get tonight and he is going to be able to push that in tonight tonight strings poplin it's a no a Collies Walking Tall made that dive happen before Hannah arrived there's no chance for rest of you'll actually fight back going across before he's even in any immediate danger but it isn't no hesitation that just pulled the trigger placed out there's going to be that kind of really good way of control from Cancun to bet that protects these wave on the balance and is able to set up that dive I want to go to Richard plus the extra csu's got that have already 600 gold lead to fun Plus Phoenix is the first be recalled come through the bottom Lane as well and nothing too surprising me decide it's not like it's trying to farm is not from the same success that do you know what he has to be really interesting to see where don't be actually doesn't like to go with us build if it is snowing like it's Derek's rush if we had kind of scene from solo queue in the past has made Saiyans know I wouldn't be too shocked and awed quite a bit of early game dammit and tankiness certainly not as much in the later stages of something if you work to rush liquor randuin's or whatever but can be very very powerful the entire point of the Scion kit is the extra help you gain with your W-4 the passive its own estate sales off of double scales yeah one of the things he's able to do with them as well if you really don't need the LT just a couple of mechanics built into another wife but otherwise fun Champion for the Scion Demolisher what else you got around to it and make a big hammer
considering this metal shake-up I think that damn one is is going to be a team that actually works better with this kind of War Vault you know when you look at guys like shomaker like now you're either going to be able to play a lot more of these flexfix Flex has never been a strength of TL they play their style and they hope that that works where I know we can certainly see things along wine the Renekton dilution the Tristana getting flexed around that is going to give draft advantages to damn one who's already sitting on blue side that kind of time outside sitting below 500 you know would actually splitting game with black swirls from the LMS how then when they did go back to that phone style really get that self-belief and you know behind what it'd be able to win out on the best advice I think that they should learn from thatas an individual have one of these made fix in a double of had been playing things like they are on his stream it still changes the way that your team has to play around you and Team Liquid is such a team that is built around team fighting 5e 5 protect double if that is how they win their championships that is how they had to accept that I must die and I do think going to amaze if I would be a pretty big step away from that recipe for success in Europe ban themselves know he might want to see liquids for comps has been playing Sona Tom kench or sewn at Erica's that sort of Avenue is still there instalok gragas oap General Grabber down here because he also is such a powerful take away now you know it's something that is really comfortable playing very likely could be looking towards you like Riga Taco combo incredibly powerful and such easy set up when you hit level sixgo down to the bottom of the barrel and nuclear stability in that calm it's also one of the few complications if you get it together and get it rolling in a team $0.05 I think it had the weaknesses of what may be nuclear and Barrel a feeling in this head-to-head matchup locked in here for them as well as possible and also very likely this is going to be not Gary's bladimir this is one of his key pixie like the playing Cuttery greedy Ariana going for things like Paul Litecoin she almost always takes klepto in lieu of things to do like that phase rush and he's such an incredibly strong leading player they can create these Monumental advantages but you can seebuilding for v u v this is very few opposed strategies here when you have a guy stuff alongside the galley OJ for you looking for v u v you're looking to set up around this Paisa I will come to see if they want to remove the supports and arguably top laners bastide liquid need to fill his composition as damn one themselves don't have a bottle in just yet unless that Flex comes through Lisa support for that's flexible there as well so well not pulling it Team Liquid pick and ban Vladimir in the small plane that's why I'm so surprised that they went to something like the job and obviously respecting the depth of compact champion pool right now but I think that this is a little bit of are you if you don't get to pick their in the top line has shown so successfully how willing he is to just you know let this plane has been popularI'm no we are I wouldn't I be expecting it to be support here for corejj but it is possible that could be going mid-length can do for Jensen or even theoretically up to that Top Lane so we have to keep that in mind but no corrige a day certainly what's playing the gal you actually pretty heavily back at MSI or List It was one of their go to pick 10 strategies alongside the Chrysler change it to Delia however threw let him for a solo Lando the reduction of that you just have such a good boy in the priority and I would like to take him if he just so far they have a really good. I've made. Bottom bunk you know if you're able to guarantee that priority and get that job you can really play. Electrons split Batman versus notary that's what Luke is a very successful and a victory and if you can't handle that and still flat oats to Big sort of support pick up Matt is gone a lot of course like me to be in the top teeth coming instop playing out like a truck that has been gutted in terms of early gain weight but it is so much harder to check out that late or something I have been seeing a fair bit in Solo Que te pegar El especialito parrot alongside something like the Alistar setup still incredibly well for the cage you can go in with that engage and is going to be galio support here as I bought you this is something that they're going to be very careful about on that bottom side because if you change the combo from Alex are into a cage that does up so incredibly easy for someone like brackets to come down the only real way to escape that is having your flash up their team liquid is going to play very caught with Leon that bottom Lane for risk getting hundreds of 0 between the ignite in the ultimate and that makes the Distortion from the LeBlanc going to beincredibly risky late James Viking tool as well because you could get for that I think there are actually a ton of fools right now the damn want to wind up by B-52 are we expected them to go to 131 not necessarily with such a good collapsed I think the sword father drop is heavily favoring the L DK lineup Stephen exciting draft right here is your right the vigorous the bottom Lane well past the time you can stop right there really hoping that this is a player if you haven't been watching since it's time to watch him now he's going to be a huge Force for this Watts the right now so he's my pleasure to watch right here but Team Liquidend of the first game of World for the North American Champions Team Liquid feed here if he cheated earlier pick up something I got a highlight right off the bat it's the call start year for another you're going to see if the klepto this is called this is very much his place out something that he's really well known for and it's so dangerous when you are playing against someone like this was going to be so talented individually and on the Vladimir skills incredibly well and if you didn't check it out for us did a really great breakdown of time specifically the field he goes to what is a guy that has been playing letting me the whole year and is revelot revolutionize multiple build he started with the door and drinks. Then he went to was it CC Dr Adam this time you're probably going to seem also go for an early Nomad Medallion being ever build up that's cheap and efficient CD out and then go generation items be able to flush a Medicaid and it becomes are really difficultproposition for your opponent right it if you are at Smithy do you dedicate your early game time is trying to keep down this Vladimir that is somewhat of a ticking time-bomb you may hold him down for a bit when that cut their goals is coming in to call flashes that cashes out you really are going to be ramped up in that big and pretty quickly and help other parts of the map that was an area of impact game I felt like. Much better for Tame like what he was constantly running out of that Top Line so I think that this might not necessarily Len to that place all I would like to see them go bowling on the bottom part bottom Lane is the fact that he was spotted while it is jungle route because you saw impact come to Lane a little bit late with damage on him he leased the red dolphin encounter surmised. Jarvis start a while to my knowledge but you do expect a week for the gragas so he's in a little bit more fog of War goinghe was actually spotted on toward their butt is there a really sloppy walked over where there's no reason that show maker should have been able to actually know play to the other side of the map you even called it out for you cuz they knew that he was very likely starting on that top side given that impact showed up late to Lane so perhaps a little bit of a Jitters there in the early game from shomaker very aggressively not having the teleport to get back as well that's going to cost him to experience and when you're playing against the LeBlanc experience becomes a very crucial because it all in at that level 6 months especially if she hits the best can become very impressive in the lions always expect can you tune a visit is going to try and even at that cat could also take a look at the buys right it's just a refillable know when you're looking over on the other side getting that dark seal on the 1st by is going to be very preferential here for Jensen so in these coming minutes how you certainly going to be sitting pretty but you're expecting that all then much on the way out has any kids up from first damage if you are able to land abilities and that is going to require a very good Brock control so I'm interested to see how they maintain this book and what do they can continue to replicate that in the link that I feel like it's going to be necessary I definitely agree it is incredibly important in awhile you can kind of play more aggressively I feel in these early levels against Veigar as you start stacking up that passeth as you start getting these Vibes and especially when you hit Level 6 the birth essential alongside Alistar combo with Ignite really does friend the hundred to zero type of place OTL is going to try to have to create event adjust in these early levels and in trying to get something done before down one can get there when we should look to open up this map is through a lot of what is already going well for the midline push is going to pay that bottom line push that opens up the blue side bottom jungle experience what is going to sit and if you open that up for Smitty it's only going to make good thing so I think this is one of those explosives and if you take a look very easily see where Dom Juan is playing to look here on the mini map for deep words in that TL topside jungle this is why we are thinking and fax it back under Torrid willing to give up farm he knows he is playing weeks out of the map and see if you step up if you're trying to trade with his Vladimir despite the fact that Vladimir's week in the early levels Caton could very easily be behind him so this is intelligent play from impacting despite the fact that he's down for him he has to play it out this way and the first time it's missing shows on the east side of the map he actually he's able to show up back to I like impact time and once again so many promising performances recently definitely Incredibles player has been one of the best top rated North America for a while but a while people have told him to number 1 to be fair to your point I think that's clear but he's definitely been a good player on the world stage when it matters most and you can see that trade get some pretty close and far 5ps difference. Too bad maybe a repeat like me to hold the button actually just been getting better in general you know if you think back to the performance is licorice was also able to have it was a role that was up in heavily criticized going International Tournament but I feel like it has started to be remedied yeah definitely agree you do mostly on the back so if I think impact as well as liquor she's got to have been really fixed and out for the team and certainly no excited to see how they will be able to perform against Tom competition here but us far pretty slow early game it is going to be infertile first dragon so if either one of these teams are going to be looking to make a move toward that but that's where it feels like The Unwanted to tracking a Smithy everywhere he goes they have had such good Vision it had so many paying for it down across the map you know you can still see their is 1 of a cup in his jungle over here no there's another pink or down in the bottom side he spotted out starting at this Dragon so it's missing is really kind of been stifled really good Ward from them on again for the breakers Predator X out but the rest of the squad when can they come down you got the Block in first before mother is there without Shoemaker showing up it isn't fertile trait going to Team Liquid very early on 7 Minutes in a really nice timing on The Inferno dragon as well that means you no one will waive pushed out the liquid candy into a Rachel and Top Lane flip is what we call it the second objective and liquid very much in control of the pace of this early game yeah they certainly are in a lot of it is just off of that furly game gang from around and show maker at 6 I don't do not come you got to jump on your body as well not going to go for the flash play so far okay now what is that trait of ultimates you can see better actually going away from a CDR Bill though he is likely going straight towards full apk here looking more for kind of that one round style of Vladimir when you do go for spellbinders orbund
is a lot of Hope for the two teams meme on Twitter against each other give us Rumble Fionna and give us a xercor keep rumbling Kiana are the two most successful fix for clutched in every game of the semi-final nearly swept them self Tiana and Corky fit another really good flexible aggressive Champion melee magic damage. Of course but getting likes to use a whole lot for sale High Pointe 15how are people who are Keanu is definitely a fixed it a lot of teams were willing to let slide through the first phase of pics and then it would end up getting banned in Phase 2 but I would stay in the past week or so we've received the present Spike barely fart showing the first take ear if it's not I wouldn't be too surprised to see if it's like blood and it's the first big for po eat the first cigarette away and he's still up there as well and the mate split so far but you never know on the table Yeah I also wonder since the mate was the player who had the most games on at what he would decide to Lane against it and if they end up walking in this Renekton which day do nowthere's a decent chance that that Renekton goes mid as far as the things that Keanu can occur again it is that fighter skirmisher type champ Tiana and it has larger GPS still coming in here from clutch and of course no surprise as well just be a leader bringing this pic forklift pacifically is 8 play of the split most play Champion Ford starter with all the other stuff is the priority for steaming I really like Star Trek II in answer to a lot of these melee assassin Iana because the ultimate could be such a good answer to any Champion that has two hard commit mail a race as well for the squad this is vog putting a lot of very aggressive male a heavy champion Black Rock for a lot of birth year on the field seaside yeah I do think that the bottom linea lot of fans towards a correction as far as overall Focus code E7 Vulcan we're actually pretty happy with how they recorded biofrost clutch might be fairly comfortable so far already Faker for SATs play the Renekton mid try and be a very oppressive and then have answers later on in the game 2 on the side of Steel Jeep is one of the best junglers to pair with this Champion being able to wash body plan is very potent early on in the game plus progress right now does provide a very good AP threat for later onTiana in this situation is going good Lane and that means a truck to be going pause Lane how to assume you'll feel because ruin was pretty much the only player to play Camille as in a prox counterpick Kaiser has enough magic damage that it would be okay to have Camille and Renekton as your soul enters and we're also thinking that Renekton is going to be a decently strong pick any kind that's what it is but that's what you have to deal with in North America for a while how come fix phase of banty or to do definitely a possibility for Clutch Gamingand I will try to make it to the final choices right now you know the right now before fan despite being file Frost boat Flight Support it's unlike one and five of the pantheon counter picks to Waycross he has married many games for three players pretty much from screams at the game place and it is a Cassiopeia hear the hover over for the volibearsystem fan favorite support Champion do the bar and some more engaged options as real Phelps and they're compromised gay biofrost rakan is Queen especially on the big stage one of the champion to use last time he was in his Champion into the record for the big are definitely going to have a lot of forms of initiation very very goodit's going to be about which those tools effectively which team can get control of mid lane as well to try and stop by and looking forward into this game there's a lot of help on the side of much gaming and the targets for Kiana to actually assassinate are pretty slim especially with house Dave Cody son plays in the mid-to-late game so I think it's going to be a very difficult one of the things that happens when you first picks at Champion I think clutch has been very cognizant of the competition they put together so they don't get punished by Keon you put that one together XIV champion of the split for Damonte Renekton coming in as a counterfeit keep prepared for the Keanu first pick a side of a draft face if that's okay no problemwatch this one so far in summer hoping they can take a third-place you're themselves do I have a quick pause on screen how can I screen right there first time he's been this stage of this pic yeah a lot of the Equator super excited to be on the stage in Detroit has been an amazing crowd so far early on in the fan. Outside we had so many clutch and CLG fast show up to a lot of the food they were going to have a little bit of a Popeye's right before getting into the game but I also like how there's more that goes with this game one than just the start of the series kind of the rights to Kiana have been thrown down here clutch you know that they are very willing to pick this Champion even on blue side and they've thrown dancing OKC LG if you can win with Keanu then they're going to have full control of this pivotal Champion for all of champ select yeah I completely agree and calling back to when p o e did play it it was in that game 3 against Cloud 9 of the semi-finals you only game that she owed you was able to win but it wasn't your typical key on a victory it wasn't winning Lane with gang cast list and then snowball to decide Lanes in when he quickly it was a come-from-behind victory with some very clutch length am I picking out a very reliable way to win with Dianna more like okay. Serviceable with the champion which does kind of calling to question I think validate the gamble the clutch is taking on his Kiana so Jacoby point this is kind of the game to prove whether or not to watch active and it going forward or if this is just purely icog champ select bird I will see what happens right here it is good to see it in game 1 and if she continues to perform here in the summer split third place on the wine for the first opponent you're the regional qualifier for World in two weeks time did Lena squaring off both with oversized to Hoops for weapons. Amante also and accurately size hula hoop by the way that is the correct proportion for a hula hoop they are big full rotation without it we got a really interesting discussion for both of these teams throughout the summer split by the way if you have been very focused on objective but fairly different objectives different size is a mess where the best teams at controlling the dragon side of the map on the lower half of the map Clutch Gaming one of the best actually the best at controlling the rift Herald top side of the map as far as if we are going to have split cancer as they start off on Red Bus for both Tumblr and also thinking about the jungle matchup weekly was held down fairly substantially by Spence care in the semifinals and had a very austere he's looking at the Champions that they're playing in this game lyrics going to be heavily focused on getting up to level 6 where he can then start making plays around that Rift Herald we just talked about putting your the game I wonder where Wiggly's going to look because he will want to pull off some successful game General ecog is a plot for top Focus team depending on the game and rarely pho mid if they have picked a composition what do Focus around mid with the Grog astatke on it so again playing a little bit off of their Norm with these pics and the stuff you look a little bit further into the game is garage sales to get a good Fighter game Ponte Vedra made or towards the bottom half of the map be honest so good at using the ultimate you opposed to level 6 in the dragon fight scene Get to blow up basically in a float on water as well as they say they're so horrible fight 10 towards that half of the map waiting and seeing at the phrase come forward perfect CS allow for the month to hear 999 the first three ways practice that one at home with a good start so far in his Lenny face for sure if he was going to lose some of this one is like watching mid laners play Renekton because I feel like sometimes pilot him a little bit differently than top laners do what you much more they'll focus and you'll charge of his right to Fair bit but here is that talks about 1 to get that killed their going to have him power it's done already burned what they read it again by the fruit water version crappie teams that was just answered the five-man midday 3 minutes and 30 second in a little bit of a strange-looking Chase towards the river or power people Ripple hit the water blades to actually lowering his damn it for the CC and then for ruin flash flood one side of the word execute us to get to the other side it still dies also giving up the Summoner spells I'd like to if you look at the top wave right now away from him so you can never get away from Kiana by running to the river because it's full of water element if you see their power of evil able to get it weekly Flash sometimes when players come onto a bigger stage for the first time they end up playing more passively. What is happening here although I think there could definitely be some Jitters at work here the fact that the retreat towards his turret when he had slice Dice and Flash up but instead Retreat it down for the fact that ruined then sloppily died in the top River with his flash being burned at the very end I think it'll take a little bit of time for these guys to settle in early on everything is showing up clutch yeah that's way in the mid lane was definitely steals the advantage at the beginning and yet because they have to lead or teleport they are not quite as coordinated in the Roundup it is Clutch Gaming with the early lead in this game and I want to call the attention towards topside Kobe wear after we saw a ruined die the way was in a really bad spot it actually got froze in front of her knee skirt for about two or three way so you can see now 35cs 217 guti Haz a level up in it as well as three charges of that corrupting potion so we'll be able to pick up some of that cs-12 crashes against his terrific uni definitely in a powerful position right now in Atlanta and Stampy and still act this is one of the Holy Trinity of Huna Champion a hard carry games on the Gangplank has definitely been one that gets perform very well on the RTC weekly coming up to the top side trying to allow her ruin some extra control here with a minion wave well-positioned now in front
reverse it's much more difficult keep in mind it's the LG also fan a Collie on blue side that they do not want to play fun of me most powerful pics in the entire game right now as a first pick that might even give more way over to Clutch Gaming and Dick Van let me see what your hands are tied though cuz every team bands Union red side of got to get you to buy us some how do you call a Somali Bantu Rumble there are not enough options but going to get something that's filled she is afraid of if I was xiyouji the calculated risk which is be leaving a Collie on back but it's not something your mate has played in the playoffs thus far it is something to Jensen did pick a lot against Amante and as far as your hands being tied behind your back I think this last man is probably have to see what she does I'm so scared right now if I'm still has been a great Kiana alsoMark every way there is one of those diarrhea Khan is left up that was one of the band that was used last time around to send it has the combo available there with with my dancers but I think your mind is in the right place free turning your eyes or what is our strength rather than what is but the strength because they're not going to patch up all of the holes in the ship you can actually feel all of that water do with your strength power of evil here has been able to hold Midland put it out there winter been around saying about frost a winning Lane trying to get an advantage in the Box out of map with Ezra LeConte still ended up getting a fit stick say I do want to make a quick point though about O U Can't Touch X Champion I feel like a lot of teams end up going through this and when the list of Champions becomes too large becomes good that's when they're actuallyplay gorkhali are really are says it's like well actually they're going to beat you with a lot of different stuff in clutch is working towards that truck still to grab that one pretty early and not going to take this one no problem here this diet is taken first they are daring clutch to take the wreck on solo will be that one does come through mean walk let's go to take away that crack is that what you played last game actually if what gaming win it with these reverse 10 reasons I applied geology for picking the key on aggregate combo in their game same thing goes for clutch here comes in with a body slam flash got to get the kill basically like that is such a high-pressure Duo for Midland they are willing to split up the diarrhea caused by taking just a rakan have it not a lot of teams are at right nowvery popular in Europe they do it all the time different here and I like how to set up a draft right now I think they're happy to protect this 8 trucks right now they have an extra bandages throw up the Gangplank they can push spoony down they can play another different match up here and still have a lot of room to find a bit limited of work for a few if it is quite large I think in a world where you're afraid of 18 different lug Chevy Champions and it's been a good day so far and I also like the level of taking is that she has with their picks locks so far and the fact that they're banning out Cody Johnson most successful champions in the playoffs in general Cody sun is plate silver cigarette case you're bad. We pushed down a little bit on what shampoo94th and clutch with handle a little bit then because it is going to leave the Gangplank up still that did well in the last game and ruin had a horrible time at the attraction to match up as your steam Clutch Gaming remove scuff marks unless you're away from the seal decided they took the guy gets themselves for starving still available all right I expected to stay if their last day for power people that usually want to get him something as deep as possible that's going to be a big AP carry for them in 5 towards the mid gamedoes silence have to be flexible yeah and you can steal away a dragon so you can steal it a silent over, we're all going to be a stools when is the biggest scary games that Weekly had 4 cyl Jeep West on stylus right after the changes do the champion definitely has put a lot of time in on Silas one of the junglers that has actually mastered it so I'm excited if he gets that in his hands and they give our Vevo a logger rain Champion that sealed you as a team to perform better when he's on that stylestaying away from Jarvan is smart against Keanu there's a little-known interaction that if the germinal connect with an actual wall to Kiana all just exploded all of it yeah in the jungle basically the entire jungle will explode and stunning damaged people so good to keep them away from that but as far as clutches last to pick this is a large departure from some of the things they found success on rack to go to be seeing Muni likely going on too, unless they decided to move John of toppling I'm going to be to look for him right there10 / power of evil is actually lights with the shield as well as other boots all is going to be able to actually go toe-to-toe with who's going to get bed earlier of to get the One Shot Show is there was a small update to Kiana about a month-and-a-half ago where her to ended up getting a little faster and was later Nerf back to the normal speed during that time feel we practiced a lot of diet and actually Drew Diane Advance on that tack so this to me is something that she'll Jeep rest a while ago never really got to use for pulling it out right here by a game number one that we saw clutches answer to Kiana game number two we get CLG prepared to answer and I want to see a playturn on the rift now you mention it was getting banned away this has been a champ that he has yet to play in his competitive career zero recorded Diana games played for power of evil brings that out here down one game in the best-of-five it's going to be an exciting one absolutely here in summer finals weekend in Detroit clutch have looked good they took game one and it was convincing feels you had glimmers of Hope but it was not quite enough now you're a game to they've got a step back. They've got some veteran child that got some rookie Talent we know they can step up and play well on the station Pee-Wee's Diana could be the Cornerstone of this game by Diana in-game I always go to gank that lane whether you're with it or against it with their carry mid laner yeah even if Diana is a powerful Champion you are almost never going to see her in all pro games because of calling card of so many proChampions is having a good fallback pattern if something doesn't work Diana generally doesn't have that fall back pattern there is an end button there is no out button for the Diana mail and Landing phase does shove the wave occasionally for trying to be ahead and then has no way out so it really does have to be as Kobe said a hard Focus around Diana thoughts on this game oblea standing by with steel just coach weld pink skies well then just a couple questions for you about the team in the series what do you think went wrong and game one where when they get ahead is really hard to face check into them you know it's hard to walk into a bush for skarner and Leona so once I got ahead it was a backflip game and I think I did pretty well playing from behind absolutely crazy for that Diana pick we know that Keanu Demonte is cells with her it was this a pic that was specifically meant for him a couple options one that we want to try a offices in Santa Monica you basically built out of the LCS stage two kind of prepare players for the experience of playing on stage put this crowd in the audience into an office do how do you prepare them for playing in a stadium Stadium stadium so this is a great opportunity for us thanks to Riot for the 34th Place match to get this experience just about you and the team. cell phone comparison for a game like this is playing a game like this and we look at the Clutch Gaming side I think Vulcan had a great one here his first time and it stays this big and hoping to see if she can step up the same low performance right now is a bit late as a pretty back and forth and Pua hoping that is Keanu counter pickle work well here and I love that stat you see their 2015 summer split team Dragon Knights versus the enemy was the last time we saw Diana that's a throwback but as well and said they were trying to prepare options against Keanu and this is what they came out with make them in the bottom Lane Cody some read it now as well that is a very strong start the bottle answers plg yeah that's what you're looking for in shampoo black eyes you talked about trying to play to your strengths bottom Lane trying to get an aggressive one down there you could see both Midland and bottom line had been pushing now, people playing a lot safer as there is a timing for a jongleur here and a half minutes scan head around and it definitely a good game sense here and timing from Power bi Bo Beck's off let's Demonte push the minions to him yet how's the Restless really get going to play hope you can fix a biofrost have that full aggression down bottom booties with puff Comanche karma is going to be looking to play as aggressively as possible against ruined and your mate is going to have the early Lane priority against Power people show Clutch Gaming has pushing Mitten topside and the question will be how can they use those two pushing so late to try and get their bottle in through this lady so I think four should be Vision around this bit late to try and get some space for the Diana to work with he could see the fight over Scuttle crabs they've actually traded them and really got bottom side so after first recall in full power clear will come back with a controller to try and get that set up bow went in again procs the Aftershock forces Cody son back I now able to stay safe only to see a difference across these two bottom liners is and that made him when he goes down to the waves are back to equal here no damage quite towards sticks of a Debbie doing nothing there you can make it very smart going Coin & Jewelry does not get this face to harass very much I supposed to be done on time here for the Clutch Gaming support and I should help a lot I think it's about 10 minutes in yeah I'm looking again toward this midlane anytime the wave is at that Middle Point the jungle actually has to kind of be there for support because the first kill can actually completely turn the complexion of the slain Demonte does not have his number here till he gets in trouble yeah this is a term that some people have different names for it's either shadowing or hovering whatever you want to call it though it's been sitting up for possible offensive plays from their opponents probably will want to get this wave all the way in the weekly spent his entire time they're waiting for a possible aggressive move from the opponent because they don't have enough Vision this early on in the game is it possible to cover all areas that Aggregates can attack them look at this actually now don't mind would help us look like right now to charge was coughing potion available and he's up siestas Ralston NE very early laning phase mom is very very good job of actually winning and farm and trading efficiently are you to go back to base so when they can a Level 6 it could be a big fight but you're not here this is going to change the entire game plan for c o g v Cody sun and Vulcan now gained control of bottom siding could push that in once again this is a first get infertile Drake so they're huge rewards for whichever team can control this bottom Tides teleports right back out so thankfully for him and 4 cyl Jeep they won't lose out on experience and Minion gold put the first flight bonus very significant going over to Cody Sun allowing him the dream by on Azrael up to your flesh mean we have to walk this midlane do as much as trying to get the experience for this way and get stick weekly is here if he ever steps up here we would Dash right onto him and the roaming a file Frost okay with it as well or just back to us what he's done to mate I love it cuz I knew you were coming 3D one not enough probably give us a little bit of time to talk about that bottling scoby of Cody Sun Vulcan are getting to be too kills what is it going to win around the rest of them at the expectation here is that sticks and viral Frost have two strong too late but it's actually quite that goes for the all in day's going to aggressively flash-forward you three summer to spell to get that kill a spectator can fully believed no flash from six days the whole time they're just a very good all in from Vulcan at Cody's son and much-needed because up until that point six eight and file has been told Elaine they had a lead in CS which states still actually have even after the reset as well as pushing Cody and Vulcan under the tower allowing more space for their jungler but now it has completely been reversed control words of God. this infernal it's an incredibly important curly fries never backed away 1500 goes lead at 7 and 1/2 minutes in Clutch Gaming favor tops May 25th police not to mention Something Matthew Cody sun is 500 gold above himself with the first blood and the cup the Mansi coming in there as well so across the board was being very big lease reflect and speaking to that Top Lane matchup that's how the, play or what but you do need to play fairly aggressive leave to get to that point we seen this match up a little bit over in the lck play
play where they have to get an extremely good matchup for the bottom Lane for 6 a.m. and valve I was in and out and I thought it was fascinated with aphromoo said about the Nautilus work on match up half remove considers that work on favor till he didn't understand why she did that match up especially if they're trying to win the to be too obviously crd choice to do so so they thought they would be in my eyes but they have to not only take the favorite mattress but they also have to perform on them and there's a smile from Devante seem to Kiana band not pulling up his blg which stub leaves irelia up as the fans they left available for the first time all Siri I definitely think you don't want to first pick it doesn't seem like in to see that they want to playmelee range bit later so I ain't at least that's also had that up to what has worked in the past for them for the long-range to probate this skill of her later take away and a small star cuts dick needs face itsyoji who would want to play the slower more controlled style and I think after what happened in the first two games and also with how Wiggly has been struggling in the series if it takes a smart choice to take this far awaybut now it's going to be federally yeah of course that's going to be really scary so Clutch Gaming take their time they are going to let the timer tick data such wanted comes into a joke was picked up instantly and there's two more pic for the band faces are both squats but once you get to the clutch Browns it out and is it going to be inside your belly is that going to be available I was banned the first game it was unpicked on band of the second as far as I can recall from Whittier wrote down the question is does flex play along 5 that or they care more about the 8th on yeah you did this Duo is just so insanely good we talked about stunlock is what it is because irelia bring their own because you can stack up from a frost so quickly even get the ultimate vs. layered and on top of that later it's it's very good to be too early it's also great for team fighting laterhe was hoping it would go unban friendly to play it here and this one and I miss seeing his full power Corky and there's quickly the Gangplank wrapped up as well as those pills you take out a lot of much as big fix away yeah and LG is going late came here so it's a question of his pluck Prime at that in some way or do they just put their foot on the gas pedal and try and run over steel Tri problems and both of the first two games have been clutch out playing CLG in early skirmishes so if CLG can also not fight though that's why I don't take the bike while also having scaly Champions like you have to also play that's all you have to do it on the wrif previously they had gone into losing set up there were collected a better preparation and better executed as well make that has been the court issue now is very clearly Champion go that do want to scale up and are going to have your really Thrive when they do get a couple of items with againI'm going to have to be the game plan on the rift as well on my final fantasy channel to give you the entire bottling here is there dropping, and rakan off the table trying to get rid of the Gangplank counter picks and get rid of the most powerful support right now with work on that place would have rights to First yeah that's also a good number of bands towards honey with tea good pretty safely a pick something now unless they actually do want support counter pick a leader Victor is going to be that second that Blake still flexible between those two by the way he has play Top Lane much like the other pathway Mages that plays very aggressively trying to push it I would expect no in a game played matchup it's going to be there relia you know if you can play Hill Lane irelia into Gangplank very easily but you said you had to take 180 disengage pretty cleanly with Molly with the box of the mouth and I was not always coming through so I thought it was going to be a very sore and Ash directions to Alto what biofrost made kids ride on so it isn't very comfortable Champion for him and considering how the first two games 1/4 c o g I'm very happy to see them switch things up so drastically with five new Champions that they haven't played already in the series it's a departure from what had not been working it's a commitment towards scaling solent bottling to Prime play down there once or level six and it is definitely make things up and now we're past 20 seconds we know it could be that fix your top diatomic down CLG must hold the reverse sweep we've seen a lot of those in the LCS plastic an absolutely be done until play a lot better than they had of the first watch has absolutely been the better team as the coach has big hands might just be the final time will have to feed the top wind Victor is a counter flick in a gangplank to My Niggas be really alongside switch1 how to write a strong to onto any time again comes in a few we get to Torquay scenic route to of the bottom Lane CLG try a new look and I hope it's enough and Game 3D LG looking for later they have a good Arrow into a scar der Pol lose a very good scaling VBS for themselves but have not let them get any game early do we go on to the restaurant could be the last time today as much is 220 over counter logic gaming of meteoric rise in the back half of the summer split they brought liquid to 5 they were nearly in the finals but a 302 third-place match is on the rise of her them is CLC up the turn it around back on the rift over they can carry performance here clutch is held so much Swagger throughout this entire Series going very aggressive early on in these games first blood in game one was five men collapsing midlane around 3 minutes early kills bottom Lane in game 2 as well so now that we're in this situation where the team's timers are mismatched Clutch Gaming little bit more power early on them to try and make some plays happen as far away is Russia as well everybody is joining though so tice's here now five-on-five level one Fiskar for Clutch Gaming making that roll up also tries to let me see who called Amber doesn't even have heliport so it's very important he gets back early all right speaking of experience Bose Solo laners in range for that word girl can get to level two frontwave actually first one back roll a quick word to the side lamp standing by I think we were just watching a little Skirmish right there what was going through your head were you worried or did you know that they get the other hand it's always something happen Bar Italia right now because especially after such a dominant gene to two players got to be feeling confident it's just really important to make sure that we don't too much energy and we don't get sloppy so we still need to focus on ourselves and we focus on ourselves we got the w I just got to take some clean play as long as we play well we'll know it when really find a second shot right there at the top leaders trade back and forth aggressively as well a true until I get over here almost lands that Barrel chain with these pcog take us to damage a lot of These Wings Are bot Lane 612 in the early Huxtable pretty good for Vulcans yes what is top-line Victor 2 is going area so he's looking for constant harassment actually wants to try and you'll get that lead over ruin I actually thought he might go klepto Midland junglers get caught here Demonte is in the position where he still has one corrupting charge it is actually calling Lira into the jungle pretty quick headed for top link on a half Health Gateway pretty clothes are inside a way out who is going to find the help in the first place come through to Lira wave got frozen in exactly the right spot yet another isolated death for ruin leader in isolated death so that is where clutch can look to punish in this game in to speak to your point Kobe about the Victor with Arie he's gone are Esports in that store so he is not picking his picture to scale this picture and it makes complete sense because if you see the Champion Select you cannot go late going up topside for a possible to be too but it is a triple stacked minion wave there that is basically 50% of another Champions damage if they went into that fight damage down here Slowpoke if you have to shock in but still takes quite a few shots in the way out is the total assets under turret right now looks to be a pharmacy to 6 a.m. by Foster the corner does not Jeff Theory Wellness do you want to have walk-ins taking low enough and doesn't have any potions left that he won't really be able to make any aggressive play in this Lane so it's kind of Cody sun and Vulcan trying to just get as much CS as possible while crossing the river with me at least get to the shuttles from self caps for Lear all this effort was better than the toppling to go well you can see the gold differently 300s by the first Blood a lot of his farm yeah Wiggly committing to the Starner play style Farm up very quickly in the early game Emax get 6 and then start making stuff happen so we were knows that all too well that's why he's been very active early Lucid this thing that you do they can do with thresh allows you to be extremely safe even went teleport coming back in bile goes Super far back in the lane and get the landing plate as well they move ruined towards mid saying that he couldn't handle the victory match of the Corky I think of a slightly better against the Victor but now that also makes power of evil a potential game Target up top and also I mean I said one in a really a combination approaching level 6 for Devante if you put Gangplank there in the mid lane you can even still be attacked in the mid lane which is considered the safer length much shorter they're getting another swap app and look at the mini-map right now we set up topside and who do you went mid so ruins going to follow does not want anything to do with this area sports Victor smart play going to get yourself a bunch of farm as possible right now 2018 differently the swaps rolling to the team initiating the swaps because Demonte got to push that waive into Power then I just can't take once again it's supposed to wave first but who has the river control is there running up and down so often lyrics knows there's three people here they might think about this three B tree because your mate is 6 and they are the team that wants the early fights are they taking places have to level six it's just everything there we would be able to flash out just before the ultimate came through from a rail yet then he also does not hit the w tag doesn't get another cubes to finish off the heel on skarner that's quite like Yeti course. They get drawn into a number one or two left and I think that is a missed opportunity for collecting and they had level 6 on both of their soul before Co she had relevant ultimate they didn't have gp6 and Corgi level 6 doesn't matter that much before he's been able to save up missile so the fact that sealed beef got out of that without suffering any gameplay still is 800 gold Eclipse Gaming's leave the bottling still 70s apart and after with vulkan running over from earlier on really funny couple killed but couldn't quite see what they're bringing his class in the process I want to I want to ride back towards the bottom half of the map because there is predator now available for weekly and he could go help this bottom Lane fix it in a Flash list lights out play from ruin their actually in a whole wave given up by Rooney to try and go for that kill not to mention this is one of ultimate so they will not be able to use that body weight in your package came ashore too and you're going to knock him down there right Away Great kill for CLT that's huge Force EOD power vehicle gets the package kill that's good have fun Trinity Force for Corky as soon as he gets that they will be off the ground Wiggly also going to take the opportunity since they
game to them when they were on this side clutch was able to ban is BR Corky and Renekton as CLG ban Rumble U me hear no clutch for 6 to Kiana in that game that wasn't the reason the clutch was Victoria that came to with more about Cody Sons asriel Vulcans work on in the bottom Lane how much weight book raugust from Lehrer show is a bunch of individual I'll place around them and hear opening it up it was the same as last time these are exactly the same batch of this point this is 1 c o d band to call E never go all four games COC bands of Kali during phase one that & rum bar the two chips they will not negotiate on field always Rubinos options by there are other lane police to choose from though it is not the only one personally I doso like Darius into Keanu he can do a very similar thing for the lane face another one that definitely won't get used but I think it's is Poppy do W absolutely hard counters Kiana it not only stop the dash put ground to expose you for 2 seconds it takes away all of Tiana's teeth by presence makes it so hard for her to get into place to get a good tables to Future ability to swellAs you move around and play their first said you want a game of this Theory be there talk of taking like last time yeah I do really wonder if we'll just see raucous record here like Clutch Gaming had in game two were if they feel like they learn something in their games for the FIFA think I made they definitely and I had the execution to pull that off and I think if you are going to ask you at the highest level those are the correct fix that is the way to finish out this draft one small tweaks do is they could go with something like trundle or skarner I feel like those are slightly more effective picks against Ted the playmaking from this right. Give you that explosive early-game it doesn't give you the kill power for Kiana will this last time, I'm beginning grab Nautilus which app Remote disagreed with else to handle the pecan Leona is the obvious. But the atrox is still able to come through the champion that was for a blessed and round they were on these sides feel a little bit later all right now does clutch fan out the Leona to make sure that she'll do you want pick it or do they just have faith that okay though probably go pick right back at you at the same time I do like c o g signaled already in game two that they don't care that much to pick the Leona so even if plucked does leave it up but I would imagine funchess confident enough it going to be super comfortable with their the Tod is it going to be very good at playing around it go to the Mind Games you have to play though and we see it support band just not lie on it found the first on the order will see if paper gets joined here as well as it's a concealed You by Clean Bandit keep going to put $0.40 down it was Ezra was just fine last time around there I just got to kill in Lane he was a great team fighter as well as time ticks down clutching have played Karma create rocks last time on the side the Gangplank is when they're more afraid of saying go for the gun Play Karmin he has lots of discussion there pretty fast discussion there was one bar frosting play the unit if Hollister is their final man hasn't played it all split their Darin bio to play it again if he wants to our sorry play the first time ever he wants to or go ahead and take the Nautilus bad for the match up vanity other things that he is likely to play that he has the experience on they've dropped their own time catch bands as well see if she could take the car away themselves but in the middle and it's sugar rush though here that's what I was thinking literally just one with fresh so as far as engage Deportes going through that it's not a champ select counter by any means but it is something by are Frosty's very good at instantly for Clutch Gaming for Kodi side it has been such a big campaign for him and then his lair speed on speed once again Karma into aatrox has been locked it it's pretty similar to the last time they were on this side but they were given the opportunity place never once again which is going to be an iPhone to a playoff series into that folder for answers the key he said Diana was when they want to cry I was definitely a comfort Champion for him he has waited for many many years and come up with any alternate builds for it as well game number 67 of Oriana to professional career most played by farthest paper corporate conference is exactly this Champion Power of evil Back Against The Wall needs to wait two more straight to take third place to go Spurs most played and I think it's the right call for tlg even if it ends up not working we saw games one and two of them trying the wacky stuff like Diana but then we saw game treat when they went back to court Jake likes. They were familiar with and much like game for the C9 series POV goes back to Ariana had a very good early and mid game with it in that series dope power moves looking to perform on a Champion Shoes comfortable with Hackettstown it's the last time these teams has Clutch Gaming close it out here to turn off the gaming with come Perfect Smile price back in the playmaker in thrash power of evil on his trademark Oriana Brewing Bidwell me a chart for Mastiff last time around do they make this one half and he reversed feet still on the table there's play Smash online here in front of this crowd in Detroit or maybe his team's they've been somewhere that's big before for some of them do first time in front of 10,000 people revoking a pretty solid for them it feels like lunch gaining really Rose to the occasion steel g a bit slower start for Game 3 was convincing absolutely cutie need to keep that momentum from game 3 and cry and push us towards a game 5 is Weldon said the only way to practice First Dates like this is playing on stage like this so she only wants to remain here as long as possible do we go on to the risk for game at number 4 what streaming once again have the Keanu Demonte known for its so much and there was excited to watch yeah everybody came in this matchup expecting Kiana to be contested well they definitely have delivered contain the champion why do more going to pop off here let's see I feel like this one was also kind of logic gaming throwing down a gauntlet once again faking clutch have to perform sweeper does get some more experience once again early for the solo laners making good time to perform is CLG we got to wait on the sidelines awfully standing by with welding thanks guys well then I just have one question for you coming into this game we have seen Clutch Gaming have incredible success with Demonte on Tiana and you guys let it through and I mean in game to you weren't able to find that counter so what is the player well and truly tried the assassin vs. Athens and whichever assassin loses it looks like what what games you look like and last game they were forced to let to the Corky so we we kind of knew that that's where we want but I think we have a link additional guests at this game working to try again and tell me about what the teams are thoughts are General feelings are coming into this game where they need to win or they're out so everybody just in a bathtub one mentality and we just have to win the game best of luck best of one do you want to do is be LG complete the reverse sweep seen it before I can see him again before the orianna vs Kiana it is the lane Swap Force EOD something they have done sparingly trucks regular season they did a lot of swamp much better on both sides for CLG than the opposing matchups would be both for the Oriana as well as for the eighth rocks hoodie Karma will get us started trying to farm that klepto Sac hits power of evil pushing the wave kind of dice up to the tower in the game so she just asked if that's going to be really died me so I agree your point that on both sides of his whole lot better facility here AC clutch fan Chase around again too cuz I think that this would also be a game that would be worth that chasing me off the mat here early flash yeah that's going to make that returns so much more threatening and if that wave bounces back to the same spot again it's going to be very difficult through to CST even though aatrox is warp birth resilient you still have to respect to the potential of two people come in your legs kill you a big part of it is a talks has to get closer to the minion wave to farm in midlane shortly before safe vs. Keanu Keanu Fox Lea Farms water elements out of the river and you can speak you for the guaranteed route with a silent to get even Lane cake because of the length of the chains done that can come through and then burning that flashed is not a one-off fuel pass at midlane it should be continued Focus for Clutch Gaming around the mid area strength of touch before we'll see you tomorrow to get ahead get a gas at Sea bottom right here remains one Camp I had some blocks away to mid lane match up with in 1 C of topping with him three really close earlier are you going to have her home on that point you as far as the team constar set up we saw what Keanu looks like without truly threatened or snowball or you know jungle pressure around her Lane phase it completely duders a big game for us since it makes the side lights have to worry about her roaming around getting those big ultimate play or even give you as much control over at the objectives that you're used to self Again lyrics good early past and I think that they will continue to focus knowing that ruined now no Clash at the very least they're going to try and get that she s back under control cuz so far ruined up on CS has been able to use the ace rocketraid very effectively with a passive Auto you know the forced to mate off the menu the Beltline reset the to see a difference right here so Silver Skillet just fine Forsyth licking his great as well so it's hard to give anyone an obvious Edge go support the bit squishy and big Playmakers Wiggly yeah I think we're talking about stealing I would get the cheel decomposition a slight Edge but it will come down to execution in the team fights if Clutch Gaming finds the right flank and gauge at any point in the game they'll be able to fight if your clutch is no heart tanks that is going to be something to watch out for there's no you know which one of the stolen plate soaking up 5000 damage and they're answer to that is going to be a heart CC don't need a heart tank if you have enough Hart Cece and up damage behind that window but it definitely does have a higher. Execution and required to make less mistakes that you don't have a sponge to soak up some of the repercussions of your mistakes but they may not eager to pull the rotation to the swap happy to play this one straight up and it's going to be continued fairly close to equal Farm going back and forth Smalley pruning the top and it looks like TV for both those players actually tp4 CLG is ruin has one Demonte sitting like night noguchi the timing where clutch could look for another kill and that's why you see Wiggly shadowing ruin are ready to begin system on take a selfie stick so your vision I would be a time where you want to get a kill, but you could be closed though or they could just burst out Wiggly five or six and five mate has the ultimate but a little bit short on Manta only about 160 can't everything after the ultimate but no pipe and patience pays off are there eventually turns over for the Scuttle crab don't get the reward reward First Flight comes through to Lira will be so long that while we were halfway through the river he starts to kill a very different it has a Demonte here huge burst Limit and again that control wore it paid so much for them voided physiology cake and allow them to then turn it around on their own terms about they jumping in ignite Kiana able to get them in later lower Splash to finish it up look at the mate waiting for this one up against the wall you get to pull off the entire combo taking him down to 15% HD before there's any way at the time that means the guaranteed kill two players got flash on Silas yeah actually pulls the rock with Keanu for some execute damage down the stretch knowing that we are would be able to close even more rather than pulling back to back water blades for a longer route duration really well done by the mate what's the back foot nine hundred gold down mostly equal or seeing leads getting eats out an HP Sidelines and such gaming waiting to move forward hoping to have the right to work with a set of teeth bites can work out for them to track where the money goes in this game because there's so many options for carries that that first Blood kill actually bottom Lane right that first Blood killed going over to silence is huge now
that came 5 somehow turns it around I think that is so much more of a different because usually when we're in a situation like it's a game 5 for the second because other people learn something throughout the series I'd acted and involved and a big part of that has been Champion Select and I think the biggest part of the evolution has been about power of evil and getting him out of Champions if he can succeed with they've taken them off of the melee assassin's they put him on Porky and Ariana and even though they threw him off playing in game 4 he still dominated. Orianna vs Karma matchupalright try to force hoodie on and something else as usual akali Rumble Keanu here so it decided that it's still going to be here yeah and you wonder what they are going to end up first picking here Guy is available that was the band last time they were on red side Garner just like the last time they were on Blue okay so this is how they stopped the Hulk against cloud nine one card for them in the tiebreaker to end to go for the second seat anyway he has played Caitlin work successfully against our cost so I can take blinding it while there is still Morgana available is something plus games not going to do arelious was you wanting as last time around allowed you really are in a third of a spice the last time a nautilus support to reach back line and assassinate fix a will be the same as the rush comes through they had last time you had to put a face but there's the look of the virocon Away by a prostitute she wants it not I think they absolutely stood in this situation because then he could still didn't I recorded Caitlin in the second band plays in a would give them a lot of power however they won the last two games on Thresh so they may want to just sit on this before today or TV show up which ever one of these to get through they can put giving can you ignore bottom line right now been out the rest from Prewitt did I have brought that but they live did once again. Leona your answer to work on it quite well. Target ban the rest of questions Champion for this is the most important value over replacement is Yoda yeah they are calling back to as much hard engaged as possible even if the latent phase would still be won by CLG with Sarah Conover at I say hi Savannah I think is very wise hear that is exactly what Clutch wants to do is tile in after engaging I just want the best Hades and following up again though as expected clutch China Widow down on that champion pool Champion apparently yeah as far as adapting to what hasn't gone well I assoc Games 1 and 2 with c o g kind of drafting away from their strengths than 50 compositions and had to play around mid lane games free and for what gaming losing top priorities and not having the ability to play off of Looney on that side of the map so if they are to correct this series I think it would be with an advantageous match up for huniepop win and there are so many bands are popping already I think you're looking for something a little bit of all time that's real TV likely pick here for Cody Sun play the last time you was pushed down to pool we're right they're going to wait to see what they want to play for Hootie otherwise I got something volatile they want the blind how's it going to wait to get a kind of fish is really going to force logo shop has been played by who knew before they can always come in with him later on as one of finals on Tristana before of course it's a reason to play for him is to buy us but they might want to pick it up later give it to ruin maybe the power people are blind picked up the Vistana is very very top what you're talking about winning on top side of the map that is your go-to I was looking for earlier he makes it into this game with the steadfast presents shuts down a lot of the play making it no team fight old Pantheon very unlike to The Blind Pig beer possible Boreanaz Felix going to happen but oh wow ReRe comes in they've got a lot of anti - year if it's bench a few more what is the last pickup what is it and they're going to play all that set up cars other Karma game that be said if they do get the car man of the poppy just Farm the poppies for a bunch of klepto cold but Greek extra bucks diarrhea diarrhea Conestoga golf into a seem like a missile their ultimate and just is it going to save the same as he decided to re is Big Throwdown in game 5 this is one of those theoretical counter picks to irelia which relies on dashing so heavily and by the way yes talk about Ari if you were able to land that charm on the dash of Orillia it tonight so that should also realize the damage from getting the reset it completely stops the full combo re is Lily's book combo breaker in League of Legends now we'll see if the theoretical counter can play out in lane for that because they've got no extra room to work with game 5 bucks Win 4. Let's see if a reverse sweep happen zlg have clawed their way back into this series and they are so close to taking that third place spot clutch had Arisen soccer standings in summer have one game to go to level one in early Advantage will they catch who need effective wart in this bride tribe Rush makes it very unlikely a lot of times you do see a Karma rush for the brush that's the OG is in because of the potential move speed but see if she doesn't get it after game 5 to get a word into the mindset of Clutch Gaming obvious getting by with Coach Artemis things guys Artemis Ross last two games for the team what's been holding team back and were the issues resolved coming into game five I think we just dropped the ball a little bit in the first two games I think we just had trouble with executing on her compositions and we laughed a little bit of fundamentals so as long as you return to the form we had in the first two games will be fine crowd in a stadium or even played in playoffs and now going into game five this is a must-win yeah we're doing fine I think we're really tight so the guys are just meeting on each other and feeling good and they trust each other and I trust them and so dishonest so I guess we have a good competition we're happy with our draft as long as he asked if you will take on me in 5 we'll see if clutch can indeed return the floor that's the only problem was just loud they didn't play quite so well on the game and happy to not change their comms up and I think it was such gaming calling these seals Elaine swap Karma poppy match up yet again pretty big deal I don't think there should be the last time we see the teams switch lanes you have to be careful with how you time it so and I do love the guests are at and already strong two-on-two of Steel he looks great to get some training back off for us thanks to you Cody sun is already flashed with disorderly so big to get on the Cody Sun before he has Arcane shift at level two yeah they got the flash out of Cody Sutton yes it is Azrael who is going to be able to level up and get that extra safety and this is 950 by the way before the nurse with a cool-down of Arcane shift to still more slippery but that is a good amount of burst damage as well that aspendell power people from the topside pushes it in and gets the early room off to Mid no flat wall slam has burned his haste though if he really wanted a flash charm that could have been done but that's not going to play here and they have called the land back over and see we going to land in the message you want it going to watch how to get this up 1/2 simplify prostaglandin CC and sticks they charging us desire work on level one that is so powerful and needs to be respected can you wait if we're going to go back to match up that seal do you want in this one and they're pushing pretty well Goonies on going to be the slower one in this Lane right now, not much around yet either yeah really whoever can get the wave shoved out gets the wrong person I do think the time and thereby POV to go middling was the correct one but now as soon as reset in the Midway they're going to go back to get off if it's not a trading pattern here for the starter to help again the highway between top and it is so critical when they're trying to continually swap dispatch UPS weekly the first one there to no communication from no communication from clutch they lose track of a c o c inmate States paid the price Hootie double Summoners are going to be blowing as he teleports back out delay and it is CLG with the early upper hand here weekly ad harveyville real name flashes 12 Brewing Jetsam just at the very end of the rain in the walls plant find the stun setting up for the charm or who he was joking the potential charm which got him too close to the wall for that final stunt and also really a big deal to any burn the flash but nothing was burned in return he was still at a range of everything else was a completely wasted easily they could have chased him down it's a very easy to attack Karma kind of looking pretty good down here do still have to track the overall CS in these Lane swap wardsville because of how often POA has been back and forth he is at ACS deficit so yes Co she has really thrown some big curve balls but if your traditional Karma who dies after teleporting back and we'll aim that's normally a death sentence for so later he's really not that far behind find the poppy I think it's mostly stuff on saving the one that got to stay at topside first to level 6 has the extra CS behind this irelia they're really relying on him he is a player that has risen to be one of these shining stars of his Clutch Gaming Squad North American mid laners have been very very hard to come by and see what that's really been reaching for those limit 4cs highest of the game back in the bed laying on the irelia back match we wanted anybody got to the bottom side Folding Stock and shipping in time getting away if you see this game is only a hundred gold a part that kills paid for my good Landing spaces on a budget gaming Society Morris vs overall again I fight here in the middle and is not ruin has rejoined there is just so much problems going up every time she moves a c o g will move purse to match it and it's as Kobe mentioned that I was so important the river control does fit with c o g right now which makes their rotation easier and it actually giving them pressuring Lanes even though they they are outmatched when it is karma vs. Poppy and it's incredibly important to the river start a fire. Only at the river Vision in their control but starter spires to fix car door almost a new Champion so many steroid there was Vanna and it's an extra proven to be a very very scary in that River when they control Bose on Aspire so you can see their fear is not competent to just go get that Spider by himself has to work with Vulcan to take it over now weekly wants to territory back Nevada control it down he's going to knock on this was pretty easily that you do some tires for the quadrant of the Jungle controlled by the field division zombie were down there as well kind of want to give you a very good about the right side of the mouth
that's true that's what we're here for I can't wait to tell you specify was just talkin Cloud 9 and kind of logic gaming have felt like it was always going to come down to these two teams to see if you would go to the file right they were neck-and-neck for that playoff by for the majority of the second after season They even played a tiebreaker on the very last gate where Cloud9 was Victoria to get to buy but here we are again because kind of logic gaming demolish their quarter-final Tony to meet Cloud 9 hair Vines is so much of his where I think people will tell about these themes for this play UNO steals you were to fall tour here today people will say well they were never really off at the top it was a fluke that they were up your fear those copies and I think they are looking to prove that they belong at the top of the table that that 5 you should have been rightfully theirs isn't this is a team that is so much over this year that I really an impressive to see them one ran away from the pain.and something we have to reiterate is that cloud 9 won the season series 221 and I also find it interesting the blue side won all free of those regular season 9 of course option for blue side since they had site selection has a higher key that tends to be correct more often opposite way to see now the first pick is going to be a truck in the Top Lane and Licorice and ruin a both been outstanding top of it so far to split nature box of cream of the crop I'm at so interested to see you know what the answers would be coming out here from room because Kim deal was banned out that had been his answer I thought he had shown multiple times really did destroy this matchup and I'd be excited if he had another answer something else that is prepared in the tiebreaker game Cloud 9 also first take a truck Camille was actually unbanned and on Tic Tac game and ruin went for the Gangplank of Courts kind of work they picked too many full-length very well be topless but it was obviously quite a flexible pick probably three rolls right now most typically here in role-play but pulling off the jungle you know for sure going Top Lane now it's not really a few weeks I'll pick he almost always is playing the scaling keep fighting Mages soap agree with Tom Cats walked in I am assuming this is going to be, talk very likely klepto are there are some different styles you can play into the NBA Crock you can play that kind of pseudo tank Karma we can play full AP or the Mortar Board of styles if they wanted to draft some leaking stealing from their 80s picked up here for sneaky Tom ketchel pick partially blocks the Sun hits the favourite support Pick 4 and he's going to bottling Carrey played with that way yes show Shona Tompkins was the bottom Wayne for c o g in the game where they had defeated Cloud 9 during the regular season that was where they also played a corki mid lane skarner jungle NJ spa place so they could still go with something similar to that if they did want to eventually play Corky in the mid lane but we had seen that actual strategy heavily die off towards the end of the summer split and it already feels like Cloud 9 is showing that they want to play to where the pops out of map your first picking at 8. This strongly Norwich really can't take over you're going to prom as really extremely defensive bottom Lane that is supposed to stir fry that is supposed to withstand these gangs in the pressure that steals GMA be putting on them and I am really expecting powerful jungler powerful military draft if your for Cloud 9 in to look for them to play around that and and I think powerful Lanes in general are going to be a seen during the series judging by how the games went between the two teams in the rate of the season does eres pick even just now is looking for a TOD to knock out a completely dominant bottom Lane but at least an advantage one could be banned out in the second fix a pushed-in with Vera Tom can't keep mine for the support for the four years or so the armored personnel carrier carry that he is he's a lot more aggressive a champion now there's a lot more damage on the kids overall it's a bit less mess with them catch me is one of the more addresses text supports how to set up to be clear but but you're supposed to get some damage there to see if they'd money is left untouched here in a second round of Van susteren's you would expect weekly to grab it at 5 9 does not want to sleep in and out with their next Banner yasso taken away to deny the potential of aggregate you throw a combo that is something that cloud 9 has used both can Academy and in the LCS I do quite a bit of success here so I would be pretty shocked if it wasn't the End by Cloud Nine and also wasn't it by CLG because I feel like giving his wanting to Cloud 9 especially when they can still match up another male Isola have to go with it would be pretty terrifying show it is not fan which means we would expect it to be pissed here by CO2 do this like fast-paced ain't no action pack playmaking dunkler that you would really think I sent here and would want to play on you still can win to be Jews against it that you want me and you are going to steal late into the game so that would be the more standard expected route it's not that you can't go early game though here as well and try to really push up the tempo it just that if you are unsuccessful that really give you going to get punished more money later Pepcid Ronnie of course not a big surprise they're coming through the stronger bands dc9 apparently so easily with the osmo one of course you will see now what the mid-length take us to be for cloud nine this one is they got the blind pick their match if the karma still Celexa between top and myth and also a large number of Midland band happened in this game corki as she hears syndrome Holly around that comes through misky has played this incontinence defeat of Team Liquid it was also banned by CLG against call nine in their second game of the regular season so cute and very well so GPS the same Papa and pick the Cloud 9 foot against Envy tiebreaker game between these two teams and we will actually see Pardeeville on, so if he's defensive I can understand the logic here by the Sea RV coaching staff because we've heard from Spencer and we've heard from c o g hey in Midland and power of evil doesn't like dying Midway so that's incredibly threatening rocket Kiana match up and then probably play through bottom Lane via gameplay call to enter Guanacaste yeah it is really interesting though because his I think such a step away from from copper or po he's almost exclusively scaling at worst, is much more in Focus much worth of Ford of in the leg and is not as massive damage correct the compared to the corgis ears Oriana's that's out and replace yeah I think it's going to be very fun to watch the early game and it's not even see where the attention why because Brianna has Lake Eufaula Karma has like a father who's going to get there earlier than priority in this match about to load onto the rift right now with that one toy soldier Gangplank here for ruin the second and third seat is ripped a trip to the finals online you're the best at 5 before we start let's go expected this will hopefully be fairly quick yeah I was given a heads up this may have happened that ruined may have needed to put toggle some things in game did not believe how do I have time to actually finish setting up everything in advance so hopefully this will be a really quick one if we can get going on this year and have no further issues but it is to be really interesting and you don't go I said we can go right back to Aftershock and is going to have a lot of additional tightness in these engages and we are in pasta great all right and we'll see who can be better this day who's going to be the one to make it to the finals in battle Team Liquid or Clutch Gaming I'll be exciting here I heard one Personnel Cloud 9 dairy cow still beef and also yelling after this and let's see who can do it and is going to make it happen to have been waiting patiently for this moment I'm going 7 and 11 finally making playoffs barely missing out on the playoff by but then resoundingly making it here to the semi-final Fizz sticks Des mentioned in the playoffs he's been to semi-finals a few times before and by the way one the split as well as the only remaining member of that previous Championship CLG team trying to make it back there again to be on the final stage of Detroit in a place where they put biofrost has yet to lose a best-of-five in his light is man wins every series ever been part of Promise playoffs format that incredible TSM roster got broken up and is sent to places where they are now coz definitely very very strong bottom side Jungle Run is now walking into it is actually fairly rare that the team who had long as real level one doesn't get to dictate the early game matchup yeah that is just simply because now I decided to play this this line of scrimmage right now we're getting Vision on the top side and trying to protect around that area and and feels he made a concerted effort that's always kind of has been calling card I think of plg are there level 1 pressure going to free free plan that little a few days and and moves that they lie from the egg over from the previous era of CLT and I want to see now that we knows exactly where Spencer and started knowing to spend Karen is going for the early crowd of what type of path he could take because Kiana is actually quite refreshed before level 3 if our people wanted to craft away properly and we know licorice is going to want to play aggressive on ruining the top side and the garages can't be there so I'll c o d bottom way we'll have to play defensively knowing the Frog an early-game Jenks the top side is gay Cabool police blotter you actually are kind of sitting on the back foot and getting poked out here by Lakers with magic can get very very difficult when you're in do you really have to be pressuring him pretty heavily and if you're not able to do so he's just going to be rinsed Rafi stack up the grass to you on cool down and will you down to the point where you no longer have any kind of reform in the match up because you can't even threatened all then turn left couple of barrels at their butt licker something to the side of you get hit by that extra damage than the farm or look pretty foggy in a case where the game yes I want to point out that we didn't go for the earliest game possible he's in the hole threes also taking frogs licorice is actually in a very dangerous and had actually gone for one of those earlier game but that is why I spent scaring was up in the river to protect licorice from that early way we're ruin actually had a position so I left the house and put those poor when I brush up there you saw that you could have timed out Justina goes for his exhibition they are so at least one of the primary game pass this bill Spotify liquor and it's it's an early TV back here for a liquor so thankfully for him he was able to get the wave was back to work in a single line up done weekly pick up here though is actually really nice liquor stores a good job to get away but it's damaged put on him after the teleport back it also means that the wave will get reset so you can actually face you're free this morning walk back to Lane without having to expend your teleport so I still think it's a smart that Weekly did they appear on the top side yeah and then we also have to see where is fence Karen is going to be using his attention Wiggly's going to be using your account because if we do try and put these teams into fucking C9 is the team that tries to play through mid lane and see what the team to try to play through top or bottom when I don't expect me to actually many more returns up hopper GP I think now he can turn most of his attention towards the bottom side where the starter was up he's getting control that for the next 90 second and their bottom line is going to be able to set up and I'm expecting some scary in here to be looking for if only we know how well I miss you sent there and pair up and also this is a big deal with the Keanu you can get the guarantee route into a body slam flash do weekly now looking here on that bottom side is going to go for it going to find them topside though all the fighting back and forth through and get Section 8 good junglers matching each other right there you could see the T9 is it a very defensive mindset claim they already have the cleanse on the wrong didn't have to bring flashes but the Predator was Burn by Finch beer in early and licorice uses both jungle showing volume is an opportunity go aggressive and some really important sides of 4 cyl Deacon see this word right here they know actually that since Karen is down on that bottom side towards really are going to fully kind of protect you from most gangster ass so it's going to allow our people to have a lot more copper in that bit ly knowing that since you're in isn't coming out of fog and also that Predators Uncle down as they use that to respond to bottom but you still have to be extremely respectful of a level 16 on it but it's not quite as simple as don't scan near the walls bro if you're in the middle of the lane but not back is long enough to play the proper you can still hit the wall on the entrance to the river and its progress is displacing you there it is legal damage considering our people has nothing to get himself out of Assisi chain still a lot caution has to be given towards at midlane now Mysteries level six and now she's some pressure on the bottom side as well as bow front of the queue before shots come in one more would never walk away Zanesville out of managed to go back to this side of the lane and she stuck around behind clear out some of that vision and now he's coming behind them that's right towards though crucial infraction that one in the bunch of South 800 hp just walks away super fast you can go you can see how close that
spell league as if it's a game of unforced Errors right it's a game of capitalizing on the other teams are in trying to make his few unforced errors as possible yet at a certain point was not making any more ways to initiate and drive Templeton that's where you need to like to see CLG go to a range hood for play for bottom Lane dominance look to really push the tempo there if I'm I want to play risk aversion play Eddsworld sit back in the bottom line graph something that can be taking their turn that can be really punishing them and drawing pressure they're away from those solo Lane build at your sole interest can be more comfortable in and not necessarily under constant pressureno one comes through here at Forest a lot of times teams have several looks at they are kind of ready for Seattle dress the affront it okay rent to play a certain style here in two different here and there was a lot of Destruction around so I would imagine the last conversation was about or would you still lose I think it's the right choice Advantage here because of the Jungle pressures it's been known for bringing its what pizza last game I think by and large dose Marfan makes a lot of sense because they're in and then pick away that akali still you know kind of accomplishing a similar thing in this picwork to dominate the skills you bought length we saw in the regular-season steals be also using Caitlin very very well and they use Caitlin Lux that can take down liquid for example and a strong leader here for six a those this good luck to be trying to fight this match I've had on the karma is still up right now you stop talking fight scene I didn't go for it there but the major Lane. Support left up on the table right now with the uni band away and locks not really in a great state for pro play in the current patch 9:15 one. Do seals you really go hard for a person following to try to answer back to Caitlin Firepower I mean we have seen this is our last week we don't know, last week that there are options but I don't think these are the kind of blind pick 4th you would go for G4 makes a lot of sense here this is more play making I think it's listening for the side of cod2 they have an additional way to kind of pull the trigger and start fight so I do think that is going to help quite a bit like to see how proactiveexpensive is very exciting cuz I was called back to the tiebreaker game against Ira cotton Cloud 9 will we see Cloud 9 band Camille with their final band game and walking in a prox because they'll still have a lot of flexibility and you'll still have what looks to be very strong Lanes locked in and I are getting banned out I wouldn't mind a Morgana van here either we got more going to last week and I actually think work on his is one of the better matchups into fresh the black field interaction with book is very very effective this is certainly something that well now they don't actually need to bend a meal because they dropped this bandFox reports Tod Healthy Choice Sports the latest date we're not playing that game at all because it's still a great pics are you can you can block the hooks with bruise so now they are not a lot of the intelligent picks year for field we have to be okay by Frost what else do you have for it are you willing to go for something like perhaps you know the car you can use that fairly rapidly are you going to play the part that we seen a few people bring out in recent passes and they sort of a higher risk and you know you can still run a lane with those texts but you don't have the innate defense against the force that Sarah does with the plants walking them or condos with the black feel so it's basically LaSalle's play one of those spot where I guess is going to be taken into the jungle Hunter lateryeah Discraft because teams are adapting to gain 1 and 2 3 games they played in the regular season actually quite unique even the first akali which is a drop that is already further than not very popular kick the first time she has played a call this split so a lot of proving to be done this is the fourth time they've actually play Tom can chickens Cloud 9 so they're really needing to get that Tom kench off to make an impact on the side lane which it did not in the last matchup this would be really interesting this would be a very heavy focus on those islands there if we do get this Alia intro to be going to that event before it answers with rash well but it means that they are not going to be pulling this land are not going to be having a lot of pressure very likely down there and carbine will have counterpick here in the middle and I decided this what does he will bring out for us and it may have to be silent yeah with an ultra flexible first pic like Silas you're able to do stuff like this towards the end of the draft but that is still an advantage to match up first injury and if we look at the way game one played out where c o g was trying to withstand pressure in the mid lane and make it work bottling they lost that game pretty horrible so this feels like a pit from c o g with Sandra and a jar been looking to actually play around p o e in the mid lane and not let snowball and put that pressure off work and definitely a new look for CLG trying a lot of things here in game 2 Cavs game 1 wasn't so hot for them. I got to see what field you can put together to your neck and neck throughout the entirety of the summer split a tiebreaker game shows wisdom has a higher season the same vein coaches shake hands off they go and we'll see you still didn't answer back for game to buy always liked looking at anytime Silas is there what are the key ultimate you can take a nice man is going to be very big just filled that ultimate in this game because Sandra and Varys don't have good ways to actually escaped from that cataclysm you're extremely dependent upon your block those numbers down Garvin are we as well hear from the Gangplank and some really powerful and I think he is just no consideration as we get into this game 2 for 69 is how well there was one tree one matchups go play out later in the game so not only is Jarvan a good alternative steel Force Alice in the mid game feeling ultimate is amazing if you get ahead to see if your collie vs eyeless backed up so many times during the year and really Whoever has more gold this win because of how much Mobility both of those characters have and chase you down ocsc 920 start or cattle at the gaming answering back in style you have to help line of scrimmage across the river for both the sides right now and do look on the light upstair on both sides. And I'm playing much more about their boettler the keep fresh line up the very strong to on to ruin their with the akali going to be exciting to watch he's been one of the big stand for CLG that split and he's got a great Champion to make his mark on the game but he is such a player I believe it was 11:00 unique champions in the regular-season know the first game of the season he had not had a double for any of his Champion pics so it's been so exciting to see if the new life has brought to CLG now he's got a handle on The Kilted coaches take away they got him and I am doing by Weldon and Irene well didn't you kind of told the players before Embrace that pressure that comes into this game so how do you reset mentality coming in a game to I don't think they're needed to be much reset on the Fireside they're really focused and and they know where they miss play it and they're confident and Irene a little bit of insight into what kind of may have been some problem from game one so I think we have another strength against the do, we are not going to make it into that plan so that's our main problem all right thank you very much for the game we'll see what that has for us they said she's so interesting to see how she is actually initiated Lance pop it's actually power of evil give me going pop against the GP so laying against that TP and they will be bringing ruin to the mid length and it's a level 2 coming up a weekly but I mean syndra Kathleen is kind of the definition of a low Mobility top laners how is highly vulnerable to gain but it does really changed the complexion of the game because she 9 how to watch to do the mid lane to be too but since Karen is just kind of being told you should go talk to her that since she spent so much time it is early game this is a threat to talk so it is jungle path was actually read it all the way up to Top Lane then from toppling he goes over Tuesday the Red Bluff do you call this just nothing there so we still have one Camp killed unfortunate for him and he is going to be set for got there and has now the ability to look at pressure top plate that was an early game cam but it definitely didn't work out and now look at this quickly actually cutting chase down till you can actually fight that guy gets whatsoever so now he's going to have to go back to work as well as a potentially the bottom side Scuttle it's early level to play Go Round and Round Top Lane and a great war from licorice really bored at all of it will end of the day by 20 minutes to get his to Camp so Spencer went to invade and saw Wiggly kill his own blue and wolves and other days they both kind of a popsicle to go to spend that's of course good Fantasy 9 slide that Vision very useful for her. We match up is but yeah we're passing only got to work till also a camp and Facebook app and a half ahead Horseman scared because you're not the first girl dress the game but we definitely not completely out of it because he was able to recover his action doing and if they just don't know in defense Karen spend extra time on the Scuttle crab still those early game level to get price can be recovered from a smart or they can go to that Swiffer licorice trial by fire the fern from GP condom at the end of solo Kill from the GPS disaster in this Rangers is really lame sometimes the game is all about where you create pressure and then where you spend the pressure other time it's just about killing someone especially when they try off and throw a huge curveball licorice he's not going to know how to lean against us but looked just takes a little bit too much grass poke and that was lingering the lane surprises. The second one comes down Liquors knows exactly how to convert not familiar laying against the Gateway. And it cost I'm somebody's going to feel safe and have come to the bottom Lane, just like they're either but he knows you cannot buy a break now yeah yeah I always have a question do you have in that table top link is quite different compared to mid-length without especially your supposed to ovulate the mini waves get advantages and when you can push when you actually fold know it's a lot easier kind of play more safely and how are you so good at doing that in the second least as I do believe but it'll getting killed in game 1 and number five. Going solo kills here early on Indian first time she has done that there was another game in the living room. Hotel 1 B-1 solo kills for both of them and that skill matchup midlane boat ruin and misky Bernie basically everything but this device just enough time it look like the turd shot was the difference in that fight and I think ruins are to their came up just short it actually looks like you did not connect with the second half of the r on Tedeschi and we'll have to see that one more time but the confidence to Fashion it what came down to the final Auto same as we can go for that one but weekly ultimate do is licorice year at make you safe in Wichita disinfect over the walls and then it coming by as well no kill Sierra but the game state is 600 gold in the lead for C9 the Venice of the kills were three in a gold peso Misty is 6 first but ruined looks like he gets level six in the crowd pops out like trying crack that are 2 Aftershock right at the end there to give them the extra bonus resistance and then steals the ultimate to get that final execution also almost all the time
best sound for the Z but that's not how you pronounce it okay I see a Carro Pizza man I do what you did BMG to because they already wear that samurai mask all the time like it the easiest signing of all time it it as easy as T1 T1 that I wouldn't like was so excited about that happen it's like just give him a few mask I know you're watching Carlos just just just do it I like those like more low-key version though it was just looks like it's cut out of like a white piece of reuse cardboard Hollywood Undead back in 2005 or any of the other stuff what are you watching that still getting recommended to you for Hollywood Undead on YouTube so I did go back and watch like you like Trump you know they were there for it. So that's probably good to mix. Who's going to win this match back to have to be at least he favors I mean they have three former pro players with the competitive experience so I don't think it's going to be that close to we only have one boy delis out the ass so I think I think at least he has to be favored here no way you would if he gets his dareth it's going to be going to be so I don't think I'll be okay I think you made him put his I have some bad news for you I know going to be locked in I am curious if we're seeing on hit their supposed to go where you can reset all of your cooldowns off of Saxon, call Champions I want to see where it goes in the preseason we're not seeing like safe bot Lane farming want to CVS real blood yeah that would be really fun. Leave me already hit the fan table at least he's team doing a big favorite all the viewers out there knocking that champion out yep and all ready for me to pick I hope we get to see people on on their you know what their most known for its known for just picking the summer to spell ghost at this point whatever I can't wait for brightness locked in great Champion as well here's a blessing to be here for l e c I always kind of pin switch deals with one player on the Block videos like my head and my head yeah I always hated of the Brushy Brushy whatever that video was way back in the day that is just an optimist with him but he's put a lot of different shampoos done wack videos on weird building ways to kill your opponent so whatever he has cooked up in the preseason is it is tanks there have been consistent nerve to the real EOP take mythical the sunflower upgrades but I would say if you're going to pick up my router if you don't go, slides to Beaver is actually really good he don't develop tank be filled full fighter Renekton is really solid up their that's plenty of good that you can rely just on I want as well so actually ends up being right now LCS probably needs to Lance I'm guessing startzman taking a little league on the bot Lane Lula Draven is an incredibly abusive because you can appeal all the damage bead and you just went down up to do to you with Bill he was funny cuz I was when I was watching the first day all the other color casters are all like speak! Over the streets over their head about like we don't know what's going to be built my dad just because I played a bunch of Glee Finn's the first batch of head but also I have access to the internet and I can just look up like both what's Taco Bell's extendable you know I didn't have to look at the year was wrong but it's still a possibility we got fewer and pipe drop off the table so some more defensive bands to keep the top play I'll do with your to be quite strong NASA fan away from the topside as well I think Mike has a very good band there's no real Escape for either Louis or the drapes be hooked in your kind of his death so I like that as well the robe and surprises me haven't been super impressed with her so far he's really fun and I like watching her just cuz it's kind of a badass but not been super impressed with with her ability to make impactful plays in teamfights I think you something that people Excel figure out how to use in she seems really poor with coordination just with her like kind of vacuum any of those is going to work well hours for Round 2 Electric Boogaloo I am happy I love suede I love drain tanks and I love the like. That have come in over the preseason I don't I assume you're all about it I mean I just love being this annoying ball of staff is going to burn people down and swing swings my dream I play a couple games on him to make sure that they're not going away from your team they can make that follow pretty easy so I like this spell convince the last Steel ya thing is the support situation for the LEC I assume that will be 21 for PSO I was out hiking up if you're in the support position but but will still get to see some cool stuff out of him and the dive to Draven cop for the LEC and LCS doesn't have a ton of peel for that besides you know startzman on the Lulu to make it really really really really saw it at the topside I'm expecting mom is a stylus to do really well also and about Lulu and I think writing a good job would last several years of supports off more than 80 Carey it's like well yes we're giving you attack speed but don't worry it's like moose who's looking tiles as well in the shields go to matter what and don't worry pic of useful obviously index into instead of go for the AP what it's called but there is just give you a bill as well being able to beat people up and give it to you in this kind of stuff a lot of the the bus start to it to help with that as well as in Silas is a shot in butt then what is able to keep getting no kingslayer's off get the feeling back a small delay right now is teams are loading onto the rift once that delay is resolved will be in the game you'll see your face for a bit longer than maybe you want to do I do for some cases that's zero second too bad sorry deal with it but once again here I am kind of sad that you also was just playing Zac Brown I feel like you know I love all around green guy blobbing around you know that's that's like a let down a little bit Lost Boy Lost Lake rosseau have some pretty pretty night mechanics on the champion yeah she plays at super well I member at which event it was but he was playing it and I was in agreement with a bunch of pros and everyone makes good decisions on the champion so I'm a little bummed but I'm able to some stick fact that we don't know about he's going to bust out the guy that looks can't find the turret you know the old trick2g jungle style and then the camp going on. I'm going to fly out and it's going to be pretty rough like a positive things with that lane so verra slansky that's low PH guarantees find length of cloth and you're just going to have enough time to get some how's the weather in with our cue off the ferris there if that's really good tombow I want to see if we can get like a bunch of CDR on really somehow Force Wayne I know this and if it is the end of demonic so you're not going to get much going on but if you want to pull built Wayne W the duration is longer than the cool down in the coolant shorter than recall which means end Games, Stop recalls for the entire game if you think your parents are Short net that's how you beat it that's how you just get just get better and when they can reveal you forever yeah I'll be the helpful to have that one works out well and that supposed to be more dominant like the driven Lulu lemons usually pushing and this is not know it's corny environment keep on tracking jungle super well Wars aren't always been coordinating the optimal positions which means easy games as you Tulane and I always feel like in the streamer modes in like the more fun wise people Hard Target Zone it just trying to help them if we know we talked about going top for the LCS what I'm at the LEC she was going to bottom and they have a lot of like you said so could be nice Target technical issues going to head off to work and you Friends piano step thank you so much free and Mark apologies the giraffe to see the Champions are locked and I'm going straight to my draft one-trick what do you make of what you've seen so far and do you think so I think somebody else dies squat done is take to comfort you know a team that has like usually when your new onto the stage and you're feeling a little bit nervous and you're going up against like really strong opposition one of the best things you can do is just pick your company champ is there something that you played the full summary of the movie with we see trick on his very Fable 2. Write very terrifying or did he became famous off that champion right you'll have time on his Draven so you can see that they've gone to that comfort so they have that security whereas do you Squad up a little bit more creative we saw yesterday. also have no way in the jungle in my opinion the best player on the team controlling the map the macro Masta you know and I think we're going to have is just a lot of Oz smashing from things like Wayne looks like varis ultimate going in huambo combo team fighting ability to just bring the facts about why I would love to see a lot of that stressing to be perfectly honest Plano right now more seriously what is a virus support right and CHD if you're familiar. He could just go bowling and then like take all the money yesterday I caught him but he may he did something about so I take Viagra support for this matter I genuinely think that's what's going to happen now I'm not a hundred percent sure whether know that's what you think it's some kind of Polk bass thing for sure like I don't know whether you can't even go to Apu look up Rock lights out if you go crack and slide it into Ronin and you apply the root and soul to just two people and you'll and the cold and if you eat already comes back up just broken tube lights on to full bright starts right it's really over pallets in a team fights but it drains your Mana like nothing I've only practiced and practiced all by myself is there a competition around it we got to keep our eyes on means aside like does a male fight all for him to steal so if the other mini mouth isn't going full AP poll AP malphite all I'm just really excited when things start going wrong for the ALCS game for boys to sit on the stairs again in stock for whom I have no idea but someone's going to run in laying in the game Winston we hang that's the problem is that I don't know who's going to run in and he is quite good at League
Channel Cats brought the stuff and I completely agree I think it's time for c o g to bench tahm kench that it is something that they need to play around they need a bottom when they can put it very heavily with Florida has great not going to switch out these band Corky is here been yet again and this time she'll be walking to you mrs. are the red side to you but I just don't want to see coz picking, I mean it's just going to be another perspective atrox any cure for C9 same thing as he did in game one when you've been out the Camille that's kind of the tip of the hat to work that so I'll Caitlin going to be banned out here by field anticipating another Caitlin pic is that didn't work out quite well for sneaky despite the fact they were behind yeah I completely agree five of the six band actually the same as they were in the first game of the series The Last Time Cloud 9 and now one of the pics exactly the same as well that time the first two picks by cod4 actually I like this but desire Khanit is really nice I do still think that there are there strong Jello into this so the Caitlin is a traditional counter but stand aside Works incredibly well on the recording gauges actually set up for the buy a very well also as far as if you're fighting Powers read we strong in that to be too and this is going to have to change the whole thing installed but that is how to get to breathe in the second bathroom there's so much attention that you're needing to play around ya arranged match up so I'm wondering where the attention is going to be sent out West about wildly maybe some defensive play around there before ctop forcing did I saw you think this is going to come to signify a bit of a change from Cloud 9 and and where they're going to spend the resources on the map I would not be surprised if I might go with a heavy pushing Midland who can then just try to shove and Kiana Rome to the outside look for form in place around this traffic because cashing out the Draven is so big if you can make it happen yeah I agree and looking at the bands from Cloud 9 I'm wondering what they're trying to set up they banned out broadcast Jarvan which basically leaves up so he's wanting and says eulogy take this now or you're doomed which would also want to play something else is also not going to be very picky on a jungle it is cooking in a lazy sometimes I am expecting to be MIT but clearly you know with those jungle band fills me with a little bit worried about a potential pound of paper or something they had planned to they are going to see if they're there last pick Yer keep it flexible could still grab a don't go to laugh right now and if you are coming through Rex form or early early as well on the bottom side of this is very obvious oclg have to be ready for its elise's the one who can answer that early game pressure on the right side and don't start 2 weeks is Draven is subbed out for Caitlin so that is why these teams have been almost daring each other to pick Sewanee because they want as much as possible early power and probably because she owed you need at least a hint of magic damage in their team composition what they can get from you is really showing through here the fact that the Caitlin was supposed to protect the saira Khan snap pic Draven they clearly have this as the backup as another answer into this matchup and I am excited to see how well he can't perform on this pic because it is a very powerful Duo and if you get that Draven going this is the kind of competition that can run over a TV in the midden early as hell there's not a pick in the draft that you say okay let's just play back the same Lanes go that way she will either die or get the kill in the one we won exciting on this is the last game of the semifinals here today Cloud 9 have their 2-0 start for Define just four months ago we had TSM reverse sweeps them on the way to new the spring title TLC now the first time in several years Cloud9 do Evan stopping them at every single turn in early game composition loads on the rift Aaliyah back in middle-aged Raven for sneaky as a Christian and not only is it a first Kiana game of the split it feels like a complete departure from the normal CO2 dial where they're going to play through the bottom and the Top Lane and then Midlands just going to kind of be there but you will need to take the initiative in this game we go elsewhere call split he played in Orillia game a little while ago and that was it but it going to look at this traffic. Cloud 9 coach that stand by thanks guys Cloud 9 up to all right now I want to get your first impressions from this draft very volatile and I love the Draven workout a bottle and they trying to like scaling do you want him to and it doesn't work so I'll probably make some spicy on the bottom and top and made you know so something going to have fun and I still looks way better so cuz I know you have to stop sitting on the bench right now I was wondering if there were going to potentially be Subs in especially with such a dominating leave the team has so far are using subs for that you know I mean Cloud9 style you guys always using some of these games to kind of give more stage time to these flyers regular time or I will anything that you said players before stepping into this game because the last time the cloud I was up to oh didn't go so well family so probably they will not try hard more than before either way we were talking about you can go for that interview house T9 has really done their homework in this Draft date they know team competitions like this can work against Tod however we haven't seen against Aldric a pet barrier the game as well and represent we were expecting it didn't work if you're going to go early early power with her leave right powerful early game jungle her with her ex a hail of blades very powerful early game room you have a roaming and push for miss you if it's great to be so they have drafted to mass at Power and are now going to be depended upon their execution will be interesting to see how that works out something also worth noting is the difference in summoner's between these Markman players on the bottom seal forces that teleport so if stick say let's get committed to an all and you are going to get even more of a risk of getting first down but that being said if you can survive it has a greater than it spends here already Burger King all right now still you playing safe enough to not be found out here the first thing turns milk for second sitting in the Brockton walking right back out but he became state really on right now we're seeing heavy pushing the topside ruin of you expecting that match up Nikita not get me hooked on the way back so no root come in and just yet but we seen toppling pressure defense during the first of the bottom Scuttle here biofrost walk around Wrigley nearby but just be in time to stop this might be able to eat it out to go early game push definitely going to the fattest E9 both of them in the bottom line is always going to places where they where have you been at 6:15 and see us with iPad Mini waves as well done Midland oh very similar here as if to use 2828 early but ruined because you saw the ruins days are numbered signs of entertainment is going to find that kill first part of the top wait and see where they go to punish they secure the bottom sides they get Division and then they roam of three people right when Pee Wee would recall so there was actually no way that senile could get out gang in that play endless fix a somehow I teleported into been about me so very smart gang spicy not that really intelligent and ruin kind of plane without respect to the enemy jungler getting in his face trying to sell that into eternity and really volume under it and he got punished very happy because of a straight answer from tonight's the roof if trying to get this way reset trying to pull back from the change was critical he would have had to run out to the left first but even so since you're already behind you if you're not escaping this best you could do is maybe trade flash or Flash but that's usually in the event of the jungle at exactly and we're going to see now who's going to change my settings to win this lady actually had the most isolated death at 25 during the regular season of all LCS players and had two isolated Us in the first game yet another one here it is something to 69 is able to capitalize on especially when Gog had their other two lanes push this one thing I do kind of like about this sort of style it allows you to get jumped on here for knock-back with built-in funny damage to walk right back out of that place. It's going to revisit that point very briefly it's drawing pressure way from the bottom Lane right and we know that this is kind of a counter pick your on the bottom side and they want to bring them here in town to get that pressure on top song right now it's been staring hits. tickets to last and that's the type of aggression you want to see OG foot fence Karen is there to be able to trade kill to read it almost looks like he was going to be just short of the kill where to watch one more time the initiation is it perfect if that's cool and maybe they just kill him before he was contracted because the first who was Dodge they chased into the jungle been scared with healthways got a bunch of damage down on it is time does buying time until Madonna and dreaming to Rome c o g to come in for the kill in his PO we know she would die he'd rather not give the kill over to mortgage Raven instead give the killer for exide which is the very early from this bitch I'm going to go out of steel tea that you love to see Bruno has the face rushing straight back and forth I think I've ever seen you act like she would like to stay can stay safe right there walks right back down pretty full form in the bottom line is right now stopping to buy the solo kill or so at the gate kill coming through ruin is up 15 dies after I still find a grocery list I think it would be quite an accomplishment for c o d to win this game because it is a style they're not that familiar with playing POV on the Keanu the early mobile boots are great for Keanu is one of the highest win rate poop because every time you're able to unlock the real match work calculus pick up pills however it is again miss keys to Leah who should consistently keep the wave shoved in Rex I Cool Whip faster and catches you in the river you're also dead so she was he has a very slim margin for error and is trying to tell me Romans threat against the team who is the best at normally no boots are great but usually see him after miserly dality and some things to help you allow us get that fuel pressure will see if they can ask you on it though would be very excited to see them pull this off we don't want to work here in sincerity is in the area so I knows this potential to be to is coming but here's the rest of it since they're going to claim that kill no problem with the ultimate it is a tall order to take down this defense during the to be respecting your sweeper was just got pulled on for 10 more seconds with hoping that it wasn't worried about because it was C9 just set that up please set that plate of the flame was so well time here besides my job and you're looking to go not thinking at all in I'm the last film into clenching game when he goes all-in on the early game that gets me to be to self with the grave of Morgana has not sticks you don't have you I thought you teleport I was very surprised to see them actually fought the into that all the McDonald's food is so powerful because the tether actually stayed through this I open it there's no actual escaping that unless you can create the distance to 59 Elwell still trying to pressure meds it's like a repeat of the first game except the gang start working out is ready for them again for a very good but you find ruin is filled with well in the farm territory right now please winning the lane in that regard wouldn't be surprised them up and gold overall by how ugly at my grandparents still going to be able to keep for his on Jungle spaces, yeah right here Beauty, level 6 power Spike. You go in
slaughterfish Terrier jungler in my F-150 have players trying to stay loose and what is its a very high pressure game because it's been scaring thinking about the memories from Spring where they were reversed swept in the semi-finals I mean you couldn't get more reverse Sweet Pea then what were you just about like how far can you go down getting swept before you turn it in reverse and now it's probably the closest we've ever seen but that would still require two more games it still requires Shield you two probably win the early game and it requires them to actually come up with a new strategy for some of these bands it looks like they're on their way we do have both HR and can be available here gang is a bit of a mixer as far as the bands go we did see liquor sex you playing that last time at the start of the situation so he will have to go a different routeso compared to the last time that she owed you was on blue side the new van is Gangplank previously it was Keanu the bands for cloud nine of actually hit exactly the same in the first pick of stayed the same for counter logic gaming the both of these teams had their prepared blue and red side draft strategies that actually haven't deviated all that much that was also the game where we saw it come out with the syndrome that didn't work out very well particular match-up wasn't that good and I think you're just getting Caitlin so like I think that is a risky pic given kind of familiar with in the series right you know both of those pics are available feels he is very good at it they are going to go for a con which really doesn't mean I think we're garlic who work on is paired with you just go kayle Morgana here and you can secure yourself an incredibly powerful bot Lane that still needed actually really known for I agree but I also thinkAmericana the hands of biofrost is important for them and I would not be surprised if it is Kayla Moore. If you get gas to pick you do against Iraq are in the mindset of even in the counter match her pain is just so good you can't do anything has taken away then there are there of being a little bit defeatist almost kind of putting yourself on the back but they were certainly 10 with levels and some items search I hope they're very effectively in and hold on at that point but in the early levels I really expect the temple to leave very early in the day for this kid who should be pushy who should be working on those three plates and this is going to be a new point of power in a way that I don't think we've seen four killed you yet in this Siri i'm because they have not had a Dominus hoodie to match up yes strongest vs beerus when was solid but not dominant to your client has a trade sovery strong to a doofus coz it's been a strong point to them Karma getting out of the van last year and I I do want to see if Kiana comes through as well right that's the farthest Series in one that should really looked out for him I was really surprised to not see it banned because nisky would be the natural person to just pick it up again since you can Flex the Silas around to so many different positions but it's actually Cloud 9 hookah pens it because they're not willing to blank ticket for give harveyville to can't to pick it and then counter second thing this graph phase where Cloud9 is deferring to steal G in the draft face both with the Caitlin Ward and now what their own Kiana band so even though it's still 2 1/4 c o g of a mention of the draft is it definitely does soon as the one thing I will say about this feel like they're going to stay here for this keyand then you are setting yourself up in a situation where perhaps they feel hate you could be here I can counter pick it I can go for something like the Veigar that he's big he's brought out the path and had a lot of death with or maybe he feels that there's some imagine he's forcing his opponent into that he can then dominate in that case I think it makes sense but yeah I really tend to agree that from what we've seen revealed us far Stihl BR are certainly getting the better end of it and it feels like five nine or the ones out of plane to the tune of their Trump a draft wines out is Oriana is locked in as a very soon as you pick 4 power of people I believe his most played all time II on that list I want to force band away so now it's time to be charged with you or you and I think almost guaranteed we could see such wanting but I but I am expecting the Jade for I think they want to have work was it engage mean that's a verygood team comps for c o g skill test on the guy who can create solo kills instead of putting in the middle and they put them more comfortably at Top Lane good late-game initiation and it's going to be on Scenic way through will probably be a stylist Midland hope that we can get super fat again and then place your shoulder so what this is all about flying through play Clyde is actually an incredibly strong massive into the akali in the in the stealth so you can actually in the Shroud if you hit him with the eve review and you can pull them out with your tether as well the Grievous wounds on the Q2 that rifle is also very very powerful to the snap predominant matchup and if you still both but you can't take that around the map and look for hard engages with this but most come out in the ALCS was really ineffective to be honest with you and I I don't think we have seen few too many really a double game see how precious they are. Twice one in one on it I also think we have to keep our minds open to power he was going or Ian at top right killer probably all right we'll see if the old you can continue on the way to reverse sweep or Cloud 9 can close things out when they should have in game 3 every early games cuz guns allowed signs way every mid-game has gone Cloud 9 way it's been up to them to close out the games and more often. They have to still be reinvigorated off they come back when they've got another solid skin marks on there if you want to look very good I think both Caitlin and silver are very good of late game as well scene I have much more petite body composition lots of ways to go forward Chloe Dancer to feed you off excited to see how this game does play out of the load off the rip give me about a way to play the crowd erupted gear as we are heading into what could be the final game shop for me and everyone up for what could be the last game of the series or the reverse sweep yet again the second stop here is Game 4 in before we get into the game out right B. Wrist anybody with Arie play Grandma's gentleman what an amazing comeback for counter logic gaming last game tell me Irene how were the players feeling coming into game for so I think I've started the match up but actually play to wear so we're going to be late game and we are very good at tenpines comp and they either good prank and we just won the last in Python V1 awesome and looking at this position looks like you want to go aggressive again do you feel like you're matched up well against Cloud 9 4 game for much easier than chemistry because I think I'll have time so we can care for all the game happy for others Lane so I can thank you so much for the inside the action and speaking about the early game jungle pathing really have to pay attention to Wrigley vs. Fenty remedios brought up a point on the NLCS bit Wiggly look more head than normal in game 3 he ended up being level seven on Ruby's almost 14 1/2 minutes into the game but it's because a lot of his early game dammit which had been successful in the regular-season have not been successful in the series and you start to second-guess yourself throughout a series of the jungler there but if he can remain decisive and not remember too many of the early games that didn't work and continue to be proactive that's where I think we really due to the fact of play a game and now they can't track her ever get the AutoZone I see a really really big deal this bottling going to be even worse than it normally is the match because that drink it time to send Karen for really being able to track and anticipate weekly Collier to pretty much every juggler in your league and that is why he is a potential MVP candidate that is why he was the only member not to liquid in the first all team Rhino he has been so dominant Billy has not slowed down at all can do right now he's on his truck so we can put it on for the garbage walking down to the bottom side and it looks like a big leaf has a good sense of what Spence Karen's up to and he clears away the fact there are no words can I see post one video into camps in a sting The Crow If It could damage. Heathen ways to find that killed and it's based on a wiggly he's not going to go for any more damage cuz the minions being around 140 do first what does go to CLG wow so incredibly aggressive but they killed go to file Frost and then to nisky and the dive as possible top way around he's looking a lot of damage there liquid all the way away so it's going to take us can knock up here very well with the electric night was there and the double shield not enough to keep him alive and then his breath Place really well by 6:00 a to slow down this key as it came in and we do to be able to get enough braids damage here that with the rest of his team coming out of the minion spoke to him he wasn't sure to finish off that kill yeah so that was an attempt to break the lane Wine open probably doesn't write sneaky able to teleport right backhand Lane both flashes Burn only assist gold going over to stick say they can still be an advantage in that matchup of looking at the Gold 250 and no real experience so I'm loved the Gaucho by Steely to go for that play and I think C9 fairly accurately try to defend it the one thing I will point out is that the item by was pretty for 4C he has enough for a dagger no health potions so you know I do think that is fairly significant against this really poke Abby Lane one bad one bad trade you can be sent back to base there's there's no really cushion here without those oceans in the same state is slightly CLG favored 100 their lead that's famous First Blood paying for it to have one under the toppling went very badly for ruin to me to find liquor against look like 2210 Siesta is he forced the really rough ruin recall is he still 36 to 21 it's definitely a toppling favor for class 9 completely agree and it's also going to be about whether or not Midland can be favored for Nicki but as long as he just all any room here is so critical for this man to be favorable for licorice a little bit longer you want to delay as long as possible there so that if he goes into the Shroud you still can have a reveal use both Aaron and now you won't do it to be scared you know when you are dismounted if you have no current there is the potential of just getting first down before you can read now level 60 seconds licorice to the little wise to go for ruin the big damages found right there in a Flash solo kill only pick up the scrap with their first successful series of plays in the early games bit series at stage at the solo kill toppling they repeat. I bought this time the kill goes over to stick tape and that's has to infuse them with even more confidence series of play for them because you say there's going to be able to start fresh mint into his heavily Mperks LED this message we get really bad actually from behind so this is a very risky flight if you were hanging around without high courage you're not going to be able to reliably remount before getting birth sound he tried to flatten sure can Whiplash in a straight line got disconnected on and taken out and I love ruined flashing for the auto and then perfect timing of getting all of his passives off and also just licorice can feel good about that one really tough here now is when you are behind if a 14er force o-6 to this base immediately anytime you get to spend it because excuse give full value as if you were full health on amount doesn't actually recalculate as your 100% HP of your discount will kill you every single time and that is why when you fall behind his flight in the match of like this it is devastating. So very happy for but then they can control that way rather than going directly towards Butler and we have a CS Advantage for liquor so he can still get back in this with a Play-Doh if his jumper is ahead and get up there
for that always made finals every single time was the first team to ever stop them from getting through a finals appearance and now to get them here looking for some revenge against them and looking to move on by like the jugular Support Services on Sage support Kobe and his tail and we have ourselves into this one of course if you want since we saw them a year ago in playoffs and open the they can give you two look very good here. I'm dropping lots of aggressive takes away from Tony specifically as you heard the hype video game in the quarterfinals and forget who he was he I think he is back to being an aggressive top and he's very dominant and the Band 3 Champs so why is SAU bi ban that is banned all this is what's a graphical are too much did band all free Champions that is so natural and human has been banned out by them and and a lot ofInFocus Dairy when you think of this could bring that out Rumble as well has been his go to fix though I'm trying to Target the music. Very clear draft strategies coming into the game on the side of clutch of course they're targeting 50th and bottom lane and then has made some critical errors in some very big game for the team so they're trying to whittle down on that apple and make him as uncomfortable as they possibly can here we go there quick lock is already and it is going to be the Gangplank for clutch in answer to a collie. Let's go to zaira cattaneo as you are expecting your call to get paired with it a Vulcan if we talked about actually brought out Leona as an answer to this I do believe last week though I certainly has the ability to go that route would be pretty excited to see him bring that out here in playoffs with the question is now then maybe getting pushed down in the easy pool so they will be locking in the difference that was going to work rate with the Starsbut they already have one of the calling cards for Cody son is safe Farm Good vs numbers in the late game Insurance I've liked that role for him the pills that one quite well like the good early draft you for Clutch Gaming right ponies on big damage lyrics on a very strong bank and put it on his calling card they do have a lot of possibility for scaling up for big damage output later in the game will see if TSM tried to get an early game jungler for speaker because I think jungler interaction is going to do a lot to determine the way that this entire series will unfold I was lyrics showing his Garner already it does mean are locked into that tank Frontline to pick your is a good take away from Cody SEMO because well you have something you do a lot of very scaling Markman Desai has been in the most played by far in a 6 pick the next most pick was only three plays though certainly strong to Elaine for TSM get them some powerdown there but also a denial of who the most popular picks for Clutch Gaming I'm so bored right there to the final picks and bans come through one jungle ben-levi here at speak to me in the driveway on the back to remove tear so can easily go to a comfortable take for hand and still be a thank you for my for the squad I feel like he is being left out very conspicuously you know it almost feels as though they're there must be some sort of a plan or that they don't feel that it's because going to be comfortable to Maxim the early game perhaps coming out of out of the ER if if they're leaving it open but you know it's been a consistent pick early on in the draft that is surprising if you get all the way down here into the second take phazyme pick unbanned a little bit and a lot of games do you have ways of getting out of touch old you think about Gangplank is there a specific please so that might be part of it isjust wanted to be sticking out of the old eat so I can see that thing the logic of what they're going for a nautilus locked in here for Vulcan and his first player ever in the LCS and gets of course a nice engagement bottom left-hand corner from lir for that and there's a Four Sisters wine guy I think no surprises the tank he remembers getting locked in here at the end both teams looking at those five on five fights at work the mid-section of the game guaranteed engaged or whenever you have skarner it's really important to have some other form also for engaged now they've got not fight they've got their own guaranteed to take over but there is a potential is actually swap things around and even put you to karmasoft potentially I liked it will be, did the tether you interaction working very well against akali these days after revealing you in the drought so thewill be last pic Carmike you're rounding of the composition certainly bilteer it feels like around Cody done to support and speed up him you have to beat up with the monster shields for the Garner as well as that's it we're all set for your front line to engage a my eyes for the early game are definitely going to go towards the top laying here Broken Blade for TSM on the kled Gangplank early and stack up the gelottis passes so fast with a vicious strikes you basically instantly get off that done and even though Gangplank can eat the oranges to get out of one's these days there's multiple Duo yeah the bear trap on the Rope you know if you hit that second part you will actively putting the healing peba on there so you're not going to get as much healing out of the oranges and you have to remember that question sound is it hurt a crow drop so that can be extremely powerful when you are looking for dive know how you leave does in Italy sorts of Champions you have to think that clutch knows they're going to be going after Gangplank though and in trying to be up there to protectvery scary heading into the first game of a best-of-five you messed up an early Tower dive that can be very detrimental to the mentality of the team head again next year are the games going to be in Port best top for a year is over North America in Fortville in the regular season have not stopped them before it's here we go game 1 of the finalssummer has been a quite the journey for both of these teams as you can see on stage 4 clutch now wearing new colors as well with the black and yellow and 40 at them a lot more struggles and I thought ya mean TSM coming off of your MSI performance you know they were one game away from taking down TL got reverse wet but it seems like things were going to be even better coming into summer no wrapping up building a pond with the new learned and kind of improved pain in sprained but it has not yet been the case but we do have to remember that she hasn't has had Seasons like this before with you're not performing at the best during the regular season they eat at the right time during playoffs in Sunrise make final thing me the postseason happened it up hit a coaching staff by with Peter from TSMthanks guys I am here with Coach Peter wanted to pick your brain we saw speak of being announced as your starter for playoffs and also the addition of treats and tactical your subs want to find out what was the decision making behind that especially entering quarter-finals of playoffs when it seems like a huge risk it's a hard decision is that saying go to three Jonas we have is been great but just based on his groomers is out and the stage performance we sinks become might have a better soon as you wish. That's why we choose him decided after week 9 I want to ask you what do you think about Clutch Gaming is an opponent because this is a team that with Hootie and with Tony son is a mate you feel like they can really pull anything out against youI mean I've been with the mountain and who needs a definite response team doing the level with spirits and broken but yet I appreciate the confidence and four people don't know. Thing is actually been in the ALCS in Ennis the academy league for a very long time speaker on stage we interviewed him after his first week of game skate so much credit over to Peter specifically for teaching him a lot and getting him ready for these LCS A's game and they're paying that confidence back with only we have to really touch on is this is Elaine spot Cooney and Demonte have actually swap Lanes to avoid that games like in the cloud matchup and what are the things you can do is actually utilize the karma in the early game to try to deal with this but then what's GP is a little bit stronger once you have enough Wave 3 has some items are bubbles you can match up against but just fine it is much more of that early game counter and you can stroke of ladybug press the attack which is more for the lane and he barely gave birth to try to Simply get those solo kills got super valuable as well because, with the AP thread makes you think twice about your itemization for Lane as well so Demonte and who needs working well together as they've played weather is actually very important and to be flexible as we've seen in multiple International competition is mandatory here we go there with the invade on bottom side do the pushing of the TSM Duo Tapas is actually area which is more about the Tea fights as well as the folk in laying in and getting Clyde dismounted really is your goal at once client is this mounted you know he's not able to actually do getting raised to get a quick remount becomes extremely dangerous to stay in Lane only got to fight of the top song right now is now there's plenty of damage and power W get some health back up there on the market for that he goes his car runs away and that is really good timing honestly love you off and you go in for that aggressive trachea to mate just now through their he's going to spend the rest of the damn to do it and you choose that is how you want to play out on the other side I also like how jamonte does not panic a lot of people when you see quite especially activating the vicious strikes you got a little bit scared with the first image that can come out but karma can rely on the Hue offer the tether as well as the shield coming back up with the cool dancer of the mate does not panic does not waste a Summoner spell do that all in and now though it might open it up to some jungler interaction Theory as both junglers post level four do you have their flashes available Predator early purchase hear from Lira on this Garner you can see as a lot more threat early game over the wall but you all the damage was done, he backs away does got out of there and who is going to be very strong as Landing items are giving you that early game Power and I'll be able to see where broken plate does electives go if it is just going to be towards Tiamat I think that is probably the bills we will see you know get some of these range matchups what's the best way to stack to avoid the visits be able to quickly clear out the wave with you mad and your cues and then be able to look for dental wrongs or grouping up with zika minions could include her in the bottle and can take a look at how all the different lanes are going so far has been TSM took the early pic on Zyra, very strong do and they're indeed up quite a bit of about 6 right here by the other ladies it's been very much Clutch Gaming you talk to you than first pick the akali first game Pearson or Broken Blade have been this game and didn't answer the games like to be a counterfeit can you see the clients, attempting to be a kind of picking a master Lanes the way they wanted so much winning in both dolos up as a team several hundred gold he has used the first teleport as well to get back to Lane on Jahnke like it's trying to keep up his fresh Precure now to level six key is the target of the first possible gang no damage has been his forced to flash a way that I can was there could have been enough follow through steps have someone to spell down hoody have to be defensive down this Lane. Very respectful honestly flashing that you know did have his ear was behind them but you didn't want to risk getting actually stand up by the satellite yeah you have to be so so careful can't keep your oranges and get out of the knock up and then sits when it will have to stuns ready with a passive locked up looks like we're not going to have a fight quite yet over the river and lie they want to damage outfit go to use them running away gif and it got now broke into clutch on this speaker that quit teleport so from TSM really paying off Sven even in a few things we did see broken play very fast on the TV to join in and a CSM on that collapse allows them to fight back yeah you can see it's the first game of the best-of-five first game of all of playoffs in summer here in the LCS everybody's waiting for the first place to break out after Ward up on the top side by the movement there a little bit suspicious that's why everybody's ready for the executor fee really couldn't kill Tony there for the end up getting them later and now another fight down on this bottom sides moving here pretty low lyrics has been spotted this week it is in the area this is not a they're going to want you can see there already is 6 but he does have sex as well but have the HP Advantage so so they should be safe just push this out I think because mostly just staying around in case of any potential aggression but now freezing this wave. She trying to bake let's to go in Landon cube of a knock up there but I want to be a saint with all the Minions pausing with aloe health bars and speak of waiting around for the play that's in coordination with the new Jungle are assembled want to see onstage yeah that was a really smart move you just that small fries know you know let them know the clutch can't actually reset there they'll mess up their way from Cleveland to be losing a lot of far but if you don't have to fully commit to this phone can you do instead of just trying to push it out does Park commit to it with the hook yeah he takes that bake Hook Line & Sinker all right in on Tuesday that's when he said they have a shield and knock up they know that they've been had here walking to be leaf
well I have now we are the champions like the right away let's see what else is teams have in store and a lot of these continue as real not allowed soda not allowed to more than Bandit like last game yeah I will see you face to keep everything the same you be would be kind of fat bird that has been no getting banned Outlets are the series but I will be the atrox actually it take to get first pick stuff up in this is Paris instead TSN Milos move their bands all around the world and that Silas could easily be a jungle could also easily be a who need therapy and he has played a lot of it and still look you I know whenever I turn to the dream he's got a lot of very good things still to say about it now you can use it very effectively as a counterfeit for a solo lane or does defaulted back your jungle if there's no good matchups for it I would say it's no surprise to me and I kind of have dropped it was not very effective for them in that last and they did not die off any good engages with it it was so squishy you got first sat down with his early to at that's built and if you're not going to take it to take me to way makes a lot of sense because at least the last game sit back sort of dial kind of expected after this more aggressive listen to workout in game 1 of the Jungle you already have very strong like James Callaghan and I'm assuming that Jason will then be drafting for elastic top later to pair well with advani you're talking about irelia Renekton movie types of Champions that can really be a powerful Duo very very strong Champion death last game six in a row for Cody sun is he's going to reprise the role on a great lake in stamping you can certainly make things happens again one more pic for collections to come through 40 hits and gets their final say in the band's begin again yeah silver gives them a lot of late game option as well as it being super easy to spell shield sequani ultimate hard for the long range projectiles land on that parchment and even more so with a Tom kench by her side. Do I will just get them wants to go that route if they do then know there will be a lot of targeting for their bottle and likely in that second round Advance cuz they wouldn't have the parody there but it will be well I'm actually as the lock-in so grabbing the support not when you get pushed down too far as they're already you know is that you've been of a faun band and the Tompkins hasn't taken away. It's always okay let's get robbed cuts off the damn it so effectively the counter top of her kids breaking the projectiles and stopping the Ricochet so I think that's a really important take to get in in the first round here why they're not waiting after the second round of van and it goes to further tore up that huge by that they're setting up a Brahmin it says wani is an amazing front amount of beef for v i v e v ultimate battle have a marksman in the bottle and so New Braunfels double marks and Meet the Browns are going to go off almost instantaneously in the team fight irelia getting harder than as expected you want to take clutch of banning away think that will pair well with the 20 in the Top Lane I would not be surprised to see Renekton taken out as well but couldn't go up there and it's a broken plate again but that is not really work out for them last time so you know question maybe less worried about that getting locked in also since I left his shield is now a magic damage Shield you don't want if it's a spell Elaine Silas to be in a matchup forces attacked him & Threads like irelia they have a lot of insanity far as first thing I'm down definition of life harder so Caitlin gets dropped off now as well safe a cleaners remove the Clutch Gaming side making a little more difficult yeah clutch a really been targeting the duo Lane multiple Marksman bands are multiple support bands are actually quite mud quite common but definitely goes with the Earth Stood Still not doing anything at the Super Bowl is just this big sponge of 8 feet that's what's great against at the silver Bolt from the same here incredibly powerful and feel a lot of bright lines are to protect his veins so then gets going to be a huge picture of Bane versus a silver with the vein Advantage much any time that's ever got us out of it becomes a game of silver trying to run away very quickly play free reading getaway by yourself going to try for his most playlist foot already his third game here this excited I was about to go out to eat now going to be that for the vein and helping to lock that down and very clearly there's an art what's our answer to the vein well it's dived get on top of the Vape dive into that back line utilizing a rumble in the key on the Silas due to crash in The Collector wants more Renekton not going to be the option there and it will be kled into the rumble Rumble you have the early push you know that you can itemize into armor fairly effectively though it is not the mix name is coming out of the said Juanita but you do have to be very careful about any potential to be Jews because Clyde + a 22 way I'm a top SciFi especially I mean we didn't get to see it last time around but that's what we're looking for right of it just right and it passes from here so well together however number to forget them actually to effectively use 18 clad ultimate because they never got a good engaged for themselves with that many tools at their Disposal & Bram on the front line rather than laying there looking to create territory for vein to work with power in this lineup and some spicy or pixie or if you are looking for an easy chain for Silas a fall that up on the Corky and the potential burst combo that you can pull off their on to him this is certainly looking for that solo kill potential is he ready to go to the game here I go with number two as PSM Inlet Square up yet again at CSM Fable to lose game one so freaking then come back in the series still winning a organization NLCS history book clutch made them look a bit still in game one I got a lot of cover pic Series game 2 yes I'm looking into redeem themselves for last time in quarterfinals when's clutch knock them out and collect looking to build on the success of game number one is Rick mentioned in the first game as well clutch so successful in the early game Lyra himself on that stylus First Blood All Summer Long only second to what are the MVP candidates been scared herself and nothing really interesting to let this is bugged I've seen grasp Rumble now this would be to brawl with the cloud this is very clearly of annoying deck 510 get on top of you and scrap with you and you can very easily prep one grass and then he's really match if you keep in combat your new your swimsuit in the minions then when you go in you can potentially get one right away and get a second at the end of the trade alright more inside words here for real this time take it away thanks very much gentlemen I just spoke with Artemis of Clutch Gaming asking about things going the way that you want and what are you expecting out of this DSM draft you said games are going great the players feel awesome and things are definitely going the way we expect to see SM keep saying they exist the game is ours I asked him what he thought about the Champion Select Amigos guess I missed his playing exactly what we expect them to play so it really does look like things are coming up Clutch Gaming right now for that team back to you guys the grand much rib this could be a more interesting game to watch the one thing that I'm going to track exactly how clutch can play as their end game because in the previous one lira is annex Charter was actually a huge deal with that impale I think I broke like several times they got the universe parent take his private part a result of that and this time around they don't have good Hart engaged to a silver make the team of walking shoe but there's not a reliable CCR you have to remember that you can still settle and you can still said one of y'all switch does give Silas more ways to start a fight you can just collect all your team and all of a sudden he's super speed up a little, you are going to be getting in there sometimes a little too in their sure and and that is the thing right sometimes you need to take your Champion to make use of that moves me to just run headlong into a meat in clutches line up right now is married and it's heavy Barry offensively and Silas is well from the jungle so you're Homie real Pinkie member that's going to try and get early tank items is the Comcast but that's not really the initiator here Wego those good exchange of the vicious strike from broken place trying to punish who dies who need puts him under the tower is key to know that he didn't actually hold on for the W skill up in case it is now so you may not actually have that active which does give the rumble a higher kill potential if you can actually just not him but now coming towards midline Silas looking to figure out it comes out in time does burn some man of yours and do as you can speak get some right back there if we get a biscuits Demonte holding water as an element whenever he can sail mention water is the element that you can get your CC off with Keanu and you can guarantee York used to hit with your E-Z Up grab water and you wait for the full down to come back and then u e q u hit the root then you pull Earth and you get your auto attacks in between and Earth has execute damage so you can actually get them well with you tonight then you can essentially have after each other and that can be a very very powerful purse combo if you're suggesting that the land has a recall hearing about who's going to start pushing much faster I hear some of that far over the can a minute in that way if he'll lose 1 million most basically and Demonte should be safe getting back in double longsword and he'll be back in the next no problem have your two matching to recall himself and adding some inventory himself right now he lately just go to TSM by 300%. A lot of being mid-length right now and I want to track junglers after first recalls usually hunie you can see it on the mini-map he pushed up very heavily on Rumble Rumble Auto purchase with a flame spitter such a prime target in speakers go in the super common route right around behind him can broken play for Syd they want cleds it started out spot us they don't have rain jackets wrap flash comes in and sign nicely. Who not going to be able to write that one the second son will be there maybe going to be on he was still alive despite not flashing early enough that she avoids to tether yeah that is the ideal gas tank for TSS you get your flash early on the Clare to ensure that your fullback happens on the great job on a rope they get the stun not able to find enough damage to finish off that killed though and a Hootie survive even though it was when you on the run and him having to worry about his wife now both top laners are possible targets let's take a look at the damage output here and see if there's anything that's early 5 from Broken Blade good job by Hamden sure that he's going to get the joint back then we could get that he didn't quite get the knockback he says walked up this is extra I don't think barely unable to finish off that kill yeah yeah I mean honestly I think it's best you get me be the one for one I don't even know if you if you get exactly so great job to survive and certainly did not look me Miss played at all there by TSM so he is going to survive and building for Words early Tabby's as expected she's very very powerful thank you for coming out of gays 4 clear dunking do you can still come for it's going to be disengage much going to stay alive. No level six is for the junglers yet speaker does not have the Sichuan the ultimate so that is another teleport use this when was Fannie bottling if we're just going back bottom anyways not quite that big of a deal but I mean I'm actually really want to make more of that because they have TP disa vans on the top side and its infernal so now you can potentially TV in the rumble so she says can't actually really challenges dragon wrist is broken plate cannot join they are moving over for it so we'll see if they keep me in a bit as well so we can be one of the first one to be here will be who needs rumbles he walks down the river but keep in mind we're going to go for healthy maybe but at least going to build some space with piercings the Miracles field by train that comes across tsf TSM getting there at the end to come out with extra gold Broken Blade Romy down on the cloud with the ultimate is able to stop them and cut off the exit point
trying to keep the players above water keep them focused on the next game at hand it is have to think about it as one game matters I have to win now and fry it and reverse sweep they had those before Justin spring do they do you get Cloud 9 looks like they aren't you down if they want more games in this series it has to start now it's starting with a couple of Honey band yet once again yeah they have the honey is not balanced you're going to have to move some of these champions from the cave at an incredible GPU fantastic Rumble soap trying to Target him but this does mean know some of the other pics will be left open and things along the lines of desire, which I think let's get that has been very high priority for them yeahI got to see what else comes out here as buck gaming can continue the bands they did back in the grave first one went to the Bears vs Bills every single time is Azrael Sona you me Judy Foster and again try to take you to call you out for such lineup when this is the thing you know why would clutch change anything until CSM shows them that they have to write you notes get them as the one that's having to adapt because everything clutch is doing is working they're the ones I'm dictating the pace of the series that far I'm very curious as I reckon it's locked in here or if they're happy to keep playing Civic is that stamp has been successful despite how much we know the other deal is very very good and it's just like the last game it's the right I have the stronger of course you can pull a colleague of a TSI pretty easily he's been that good and Gage Lucas Runner game was great definitely was a strong front line it was forcing multiple members of TSM to buy qss has a lot of times that allowed other members of the team to blow up those opponent and take them down as you're in the same place thoughAutumn effect being felt by that scar on her when they take it off and now this will be going to Hootie take an Bi-Flex to all three lanes that we have seen it recently in all three rolls so you have to give respect to that it is a very powerful solo Lane because of the range advantage and rocket ship allows you to play offensive line if you want as well as a stronger flush pestana can be set up to be very very impressive there's a wreck on once again for CSM though they do one composition a lot of road trips on a top lately and what I think that they're really know I had initially underestimated the amount of damage you can have early game with attack and getting a lot of early levels did your explosive charge your traits are very very dominant so it's not just that you have to put this. Just that you can see you can win a lot of these all in that may surprise you I will say that it is importantwith a v on it and a silver locked in double Marksman board but they need some sort of a threat so that's two them do just now last round lock in some heavy tanks and feels full armor that would make it very difficult for a chest on a flex dibert actually win as the only carry so you need to know some crowd control as well as them AP threat and they're answer for that game one was a, right and I do think, you could fit in the draft like this once again it was the GP instead of the Tristana and yes you be neutered as game one was and I do think that any time you're running do a marksman, feels great. Actually pair alongside those dampor look at blocked his attempt right here you seeing Jarvan and irelia Band Away think you're the ones we think our stereo men's garments we are going said or really is the best laying alongside that don't play that one either and there's a, then there's the magic damage that clutch giving plate with a conflict this one last time and see if it also dropped down the allister I'm parked right in this game called was the same last time stage 1-e was the answer here last time for tea at them as well as kled why does it not work back to vacuums I think they are going to change that up but I would still not be surprised by another funny pic because G4 has been doubts that you want me to still considered really really strong and it is a comfort pickworth Pica all right with a clock in here alongside of college do they have to dive indo solo laners Rican or GSM has to get good and gauges this time for Route that's why do we have to change these competitions are so similar the game number one and now I'm going clutches favor it was very difficult for TSM there such as want to get walking that way as well extremely close. They just have to execute better if they want this. To continue well Nautilus of course very likely to be at the Port pick I don't think that the $80 was made by any means here in this draft so pleased that last pic to come through for Clutch Gaming probably won't see magic damage I think aatrox and then guani can be picking up tanks to be incredibly frightening pillows beer will be that back line damage Brett lots of magic damage here and you have so much rain did it and look at the lake in Tristana and his Treasure 3 like you cares that is absurd like that is almost it feels like fun Mash so you know I do think I can get them are in a position to where they want to make things happen really game do they doplay making to someone make it a little bit more difficult to ask you out on the lake in for questioning work on can still be diving in there but we did not see that be effective for Smoothie in game number one and you're still don't have to pay that qss packed with the scorner in the Cadillac walk in there as he is dire for clutch in the end provides a two things we're looking for the AP threat for later as well as some crowd control their back liner blade playing as your top we may see them Lanes WAP once more though it could actually be Demonte playing the First on its off and hunie playing you because you're mad but no bigger has been playing a fair bit of this trip on a plane as well expect a brassiere easy to get gang beasts your Champion to Donna has a couple more options for a date with Rocket Jump & Buster'she is actually looking for the kill here and this is on Pierson and Hoodie is very accustomed to playing bases in the Top Lane he has played Cassiopeia very personally think that do not have escaped so he's fine fighting it out I will see if he junglers are attracted to that teleport is here in the top side of the first quarter finals with a win punch their ticket further and further toward world's least be the reason qualifier they can go even farther from there and we can see if they can make this sweep happen Vulcans very first LCS playoffs knee has been great so far $2 games now for him to get them back against the wallI asked question another Bowl draft they really have been comfortable no playing around some of these pics that are a bit more you need to that Mickey on has not been too popular in the ALCS this far to mate it kind of made it his own and now it's nitrous on a bid no really is powerful you you think it's just not as this guy for stealing Champion Lake in Tempe just want to find out you can kill people like you can solo kill people with this very easy to rocket jump slow is really relevant if you're submissive positions if he's too far up and Demonte knows we're speaking is you just jump on his head and you will win that all inCalm before the storm this time around their mate wants to have the early pressure on these minions out on them right away I want to put your son to the turret keep in mind that outside of bought Lane early tourettes have the damage reduction so super early plates aren't really that important. Easily with all the lanes were you can get that play super fast that is one thing is supposed to tell her how they play Lenny face out because soul of the Blue Dolphin most part Lira to his in to read if your said yes but was charged on 3 out afterwards good damage is actually running demolish as well this is something is some players have started to pick up in lieu of something more defensive resolve option if you think that you're going to have to push your Champion then you can actually get a lot of value of that advantage on the side of clutch do look forward to the TSM jungler speak of newly acquired on to the starting lineup for the LCS Squad at least he is the one with the says why he has the power to try and get these mail a solo laners Breton Lane skills and if you was like that is where a lot of this game will end. Early Redbox closer to speak at this time if you've got it lyrics god is the bot laners keep running back and forth what is employee early-game it was a solos that carried early for Clapton they eventually found the first Blood through Lyra what different lineups here this time around and I want to see how much different is going to be yeah I'm very interested to see you know he doesn't really have any Great Escapes here on these are you do have have to slide out but if it is because not ever up there. You don't really have a lot of recourse in this matchup you're going to get pushed in you're going to be getting poked under the same thing really here for calling till 6 even so I really want to see where she could can't get involved in no-fault Kenny's God keep us informed you could already see a big c s Lee in the Top Lane and broken line is already uses potion these have felt so that is a rough spot to be my eyes are completely on speaker because this is where that money always plays these Mages on the topside super offensively goes for harassment really on so we can try to push you off of those minion he is booked up at the turret in wow it is going to be a blue side exchange here at speaker goes to take away was not started by Lera yeah but I just talked about the impression the top like this was Phillies game state that feels like a favorite I think you kind of tracks going to the whole time when you can feel safe the whole way through top Scuttle goes over to Lear there's not a lot of game pass allowed she can't still on board soon he has complete freedom to do whatever you want Dad to me he's going to be able to actually save if you want to will keep you back if your lane in and honey fashion as he likes to really keep the pressure up has a more effective by Dumbledore boots on top as well as the pink or so it will have more control here for himself and you can see you lyrics haven't taken top Scuttle no playing around that side of the map is to enable who needs to non stop shoving his opponent and keep up your this Lane. all right well three sets come through yet Dumbledore and I think this is going to be soon Domino's coming out of this one for you to go leave for when I go to leave roughly around there for so far from the laning phase is falling still going spends way I do want to point out pretty soon actually is the a CSV record-holder across the LCS bot laners has been pretty good for his business with you so far in the early games to first wife what a waiting pay for tsf TSM bottomlands that step up in their time of need rakan and xayah we always talk about the early threat of those all in no hesitation there from smoothie as he goes in throws down the ignite Ben gets a route on the collar right there and that is going to finish up the guilt smoothie stick around and finish up that trip play to Rico's really good life and that is absolutely huge 40th MP then just getting a big deal like that is going to feel so damn good movie was on toward gear you know but they are able to fly Seagate straight Ananda Vulcan Vulcan could not buffer HQ in time to actually get out of there thank you come down but much too late and he just gets shredded there and I'll get a nice early start 40th and Walnut Bottom side was on or not but never a Chance Auto to turn it back around I never went for the CC just figured if it was available to cool down after taking back over and let's go to get some Benadryl bottom River but now you've got a nice Gold Leaf for TSM the farm lease vs Tor plus the extra load of stuff on vent is it be a good start for them see if they can snowball off of it once again both junglers are on the bottom side and I want to turn your attention towards the mini-map if you see up there who needs zoning broken plate off of those minion cameras are down here fighting over Scuttle crab and Ward and vision but broken play can't even approached the minion line as Mooney on the comment is ear is pushing him back they've got the squad it's the whole river a lot of toppling really is going to be decided by how much does a farm can broken play collect because for him to wave at least pushing towards him as we will have an opportunity to get some of that farm but you know honey is Dan going to try to really punish him here now that he has no teleport available to try to send it back on a battery call and once again they have Vision on speaker so they know who he can just continue to bully the atrox under the tower right now it's trying to harass him away 0 though lying in wait with a starter for a possible Jake was predator of a nikhil straight up there probably going to get shot down but just barely due to the size of these days up yeah that was really big difference between the avoiding. Hook as that you're right I think it is a straight-up kill you hit that book your to hit the root beer was going to get it all together and you would be dope thankfully walking away just bread so far for a smoothie conversion you can't go back by the way why are chosen gas so I'll so you can't become toast if you're not already bread so you have to start there that's fair meanwhile topside actually booty every thought and meet up after he pushed up broken plate went for the invade deep into the jungle so he got Vision on all of these camps Clutch Gaming now with this information they do all three of these wolfcraft and blue have respond so they can predict that this is going to be the next 30 seconds of speaker time and try and practice watee that way and I want to see lyric it up here because this is a wave that broke
very big pivotal moment for the entire series track is it snowing at the analysis was actually talked him out and we'll send money to your room that it's been three straight games for thika is certainly getting his Groove how much stronger game during the game 3 of any had him wanted to so do you want to take that away from him know they haven't been eating the Jarvan quite a lot but we try to push him down even further what happened to hear Club Tammy of course the blue side off and have some freed up and you see again that red side uni band to get to keep their to at 8 a.m. that has been the whole way through to get the one free. This time around and see what else would he is a must be removed because when it's ya trying to get all of the bands on a hoonie from the red side is so difficult because he talks about red tide Hats play the uni band switch up here so they are blankets it looks like he will get one of those GPU or rumble or something and I most like do the KC rate box so it looks like the bands are really much different they were at last time we had two teams on this side is always have always refers Pinkett and Will Not a blue spice they can't force pickets what's the band was the one final option and rakan goes off again not aligned is Ira conduit for last year culture can be found at the Verizon looking good trout Series clutch bar again as long as they want it because what's the weather for out with split will be silenced first pick this is the same draft we saw in the first pic when they were blue side in gay member to Idaho so well get them had a lot of very good ultimate for him to seal knows they want me from all these things will see if that is the case this time around is always a little bit riskier when you blind to just exactly sure what you're going to get your 40s and the time around driving a silver for themselves finally pushing Clutch Gaming in a something different for Cody sun down there then goes blank during the regular season the most played for Cody sun was in fact desire they've already pre band out of a consew friends at least another 200 even if they will allow of the tired to come through quite a bit of was actually Zaya as well as Nautilus as a Duo so I wouldn't be surprised Steve that go through and without driving on the band table speaker will be selecting the bad self no more good morning for him without being prompted by clutch driving definitely has a lot of early possibilities go left level 2 Gang Sivan all right there it is. I don't know what surprised that all number nine of the what counting playoffs going to be played so far so 1 final take for Clutch Gaming has been for Cody son of for that pool with narrow down even further I think it will be our we could see if you know him go a different direction but for that late-game we'll see if he does elect to do the to your bills this also pairs well with a nautilus that Vulcan does like to play quite a lot of Pi that CP have a plasma as a follow-up Rumble as well as as Silas Marner be kind of diving in so I can follow in front of help assist in that back on. Nation yeah we did see Clutch Gaming utilize this pic effectively in the summer split allowing Cody sent to jump to a lot of these scrimmages in a hive prom is going to be the lock in here once again though just dance again if you want to deny the Brom from your opponent's if you are the one playing silver as well so it makes it a good pairing it is going to make it one good open Falcon steel though last game we saw this earlier he was think that's wanting in the brahmins it's wanting the Brahmin had her to Pieces by the need it so badly she pretty effective to is that considering that is never let you know there's no Dak or if they were to be able to get out of that ultimate so you steal the day for ultimate you're setting up for the rumble very effectively be able to drop the equalizer over Whoever has walked in there so already I do think that lyric has a pretty effective off to grab alright what's up it's kind of been away some of the Demonte Champions tier Keanu was effectively use last time they had set up with Rumble and Silas Aurelius the first one to get Sam Bann out will they follow it up as ER here band away from clutch they think TSM is going for that race up team fight and they're going to need some 80 threat I think that's exactly the way they are trending Alistair for Fairy Godmother specifically you can hide but that you can stop over eyes so if you're going to play with her as well that's also a possibility you're not worried about the Keanu given the Puritan should have plastic with Angela you know if you if you think that he would be going that direction direction with voice but you get the point anyway gladimir were looking like they have a right now a broken plate had some good slide games and it's been this is an incredibly strong by combo when you do have the Vladimir as well as the Zipper at the bottom or ultimate is ramping up all that damage has a dama campworld a civet civet Ricochet damage that spreading everywhere and can't be quite strong play that get them are going to have to work probably without some Lane priority early on the pending on what they lock in lactic at the final piece looks like psylocke in just looking to have a lot of option earlier this will be a soul winner you know they're going to be sending that Dallas to Seoul Lane a very likely will be middling here for Demonte but we've seen them Lanes off from uni and Demonte already Nautilus as expected no surprise there for me but this is a lot of dive this is much more early-game Focus I think than what we were thinking out of DSM rest I powerful early-game dumler turn up alongside the silence in the rumble hoof you have good push in the early games and get active and try to really know flexes recti month old Lane in the last person to reply reprise his role on a champion should have a pretty solid matter to most things good putting his safety and as long as there's life away from both struggled all right I like the link that is actually for clutch beer get them going with a lot of a leader power will see if they can get their coming back winning their must-win game forcing ipr2 game number 4 draft feel somewhat similar to me to what Clutch ran last time right you know Tristana to her as well as good as beer I do think of this is kind of feeling a similar role in that you're fighting like him to be friendly powerful but you have to get there and know if there is any bump in the road you fall too far behind her Leon be fighting an early game Power I think I may have a clutch is going to be absolutely enormous in could allow them to run over to USM all right well for you can switch things around anymore it is going to be junio trouble yet again no one's surprise to your butt boys want to see him on that camping is very good at and it's always a pleasure to watch great players on it saying it's a chance right here we are very exciting sight here still a must-win game for TSM back against the wall that got to win two more straight and they can end Clutch Gaming hope they can find their postseason move on and so my files lets them sell they want to close it out invite some more important later on in the ALCS playoffs going to pop off game just about 20 minutes ago pentakill to help secure and on this ion the fans already we already the players get out of the risk game to underway the court star game for the quarter-finals counting part that's your specialty though half credit because 4 is a multiple of 2 that's right and quick Mac correct forgot the first to get to distant so all right well looks like we're going to have defensive openings anytime there's a prom you have to locked up for level 1 so we got by with Coach artist talk about question these guys Artemis predominant first two games coming out of Clutch and then game 3 there's a little bit of a slip-up coming into game for are you worried at all that the team has lost our momentum into play as we knew they would. I think as long as we stick to our game and do our jobs will be fun to get your reactions tsm's draft away from Cody sun in the potentially going for that late game I mean Cody can play a lot he can't just only place over here so there's no trouble there and we'll see if they can make it the late game I think it would be a bit of a deviation from the strategy I'll buy it again as long as we do our jobs will be fine at all again we just do our jobs movie fine thank you and best of luck to you guys do your job felis and we'll be fine at 2 a my job is to laugh absolutely moving on or into the game it is going to be having the heavy Labour party top he went back to the comment no surprises there is that is kind of the rumble standard and even in that that grass Rumble game in the movie mash up earlier I did to actually check in The Grassman you got two triggers of it throughout the entire Lenny face so it really didn't do anything for him but he should have fallen priority in a broken plate really doesn't get to have fun in this matchup in until really liked Post 9 and even then you're going to be getting pushed in very heavily so I will see what he can make with this Lane pressure AC valve Rumble Auto pushing with the flame spitter under Tower and trying to force missed CS through that message right now you can see it's actually a fairly effective only able to get to early on we are mixing early visit down bottom there is a word here goes for it that was not the most impressive engaged there but either way not much committed either they are going to speak is here though now and it may not actually be anticipating this they can go forward knowing the right size is very like he's not there really destroys the tunnel as well as barely get that Cannon minion with the execute big was hovering around the side of the map here to support honey anytime you have uni uni Auto pushing here on the rumble trying to deny see us through the Vladimir any further xtra-vision and presents from the right side early on will make him more confident and throwing out these Harpoon really trying to make broken played mrs. many as possible ever doing pretty well that's why are there only being down to five Cs not too bad at this point I don't want to see you know what they're going to take us probably actually going way too far for a backup from broken plate you do anytime Rumble walk to you in this mess up early on you have to walk away and it looks like he felt that he could kind of take that Tray Deee certainly was not able to as demonstrated their but I'm down here on the bottom side things looking fairly even I've had this gift I'm getting kind of the early ages with their xayah rakan so this is certainly a little bit less pressure than I think they'll be used to having on the 7th Ave and take a look at how this team is going so far it's Bill top wind pressure broke a blade is really thinking why I do have one as well that you were the roots voices are very really, he's got scorching there as well level pain and perfect timing to get a late-game stopwatch so certainly is heavily favored in the rebels pushing him in Windows for a few minutes here but I will at least four say pretty referee calls only on the Ruby Crystal not ideal atomization but as long as you survive and keep talking that farmer going to be feeling okay I'll be ready soon as you stealing up that middling is playing the fuckto porky so happy to farm it out there and it really it is going to be on clutch to make things happen at CSM I think will be very happy to play a farm-style game so nothing is more in there we allowed during the regular season was not TSM really being the dominant early game and it was more of a flaky to keep license and getting their star player I want to stealing Champions where they could really make things happen and once I got tonight and in order to do that clutch probably looking at Lira. No pressure recall off on the side long sword to back it up a little bit he's making some heavier move down into the jungle with this all Elena was pushing up our side level 5 with flat definitely can't be underestimated hail of blades as well pilaris a lot of first a possible and there is an entire full level over speaker right now they're both about one for the way the next one so it has been a bit early start for Leroy overall goal 300 and savory co-defendant the pretty nice DP back Tulane vs was already there so it's not the marijuana bill it is going to be the rest of storm early ocean are beets very very well to play out these next minute to the game stuff right here topping still pushing course 49 to 30 and see if that's not too bad there's a way to be Farm So within 10 that's pretty okay here in Midland close to equal 2 cups of Nancy putting jerks in the head in that one yeah I think that ocean Drake such a big denial as well if he is dead get their hands on an ocean trade with each batch of for themselves it is be dream scenario early cuz that really helps them just Farm it out and get to the lake in that are trying to go for so clutch really happy to get that one off the map and start that Dragon timer ticking away meanwhile as we mentioned Lira. Level six on the right side pretty big Power farming lead in the jungle see if he goes in to try to make a play pretty good for
18 10th Place 10th place this year they made playoffs one time might do it yet again right here and now battling optic gaming for that chance to do so out of themselves and talk with them they have been pleased with their growth so far this year videos staying in for the whole year as well as slightly revamp roster and they are just one game away from making in the playoffs definitely a Resurgence is well-off take also coming off that wind is already carthus and a Nivea this is the only team you see these opening bands against and I'll be in there as well as results so far and we'll see if it does come through one more time as all the frappe all the harbor comes down to this there was the one-hour break of course in The Middle's you watch CLG versus e 9th and spending that time from Memphis final match with a you know what he or perhaps there might not be able to grab in the first half the draft so that's going away the first thing that comes in my mind when I see if youis aatrox possibly opening up that it's been a pretty good answer I mean Christian has super common as well so maybe we'll see them fight over that but yeah they're DHR let me tell you a nickname here is it cool if I call do clip big do for a when he gets big dunks with Ajax I feel it is correct it going to be on the side of golden Guardians do with FBI once again they have a really high priority on the Azrael for him is specially gives him a lot of autonomy in the bottom Lane and also can allow who he could go for ROMs they found her throat not too harshly as well hear some can she might be coming through but right now it's Gangplank has the answer to a truck they're expecting both of those as top laner I like the yard Army is looking over I know he and Joker are good friends with most people are pretty good friends with me DS fellow let's see though I doubt it's going to be a your clock and I have your crumbled quite a few times but it's not going to be the case Jungle Force is very strong as well lots of things that you mentioned earlier a high priority on Ezreal FBI building has no difference silver I like a lot very good Lake Indiana. I really like it against Ezreal specifically I mean I don't play a bunch of baby carry but when I get out of build if I'm against Ezreal ultimate supposed to be most of the keys to the dead Play Feels Like a good matchup for silver to be able to farm a few you definitely a scale when you get a bunch of Chris Cooper Lake in Israel do burst damage not to be underestimated special Spike you have to be really really cognizant if the Edge Realty no spill shot turn around to go to wait a little while, like a lot very good into silver you break the record play you really cut her damaged down a lot though like it's always important to do here but it means that now you can really pinch the jungle. Dicted rush there's driving for the happened what they can also point out is that Gigi s with a counter pick on both solo length the first have to grab the Last Guardian have to pick frog and I just they're going to lose some jungle pool let's see go to Guardians have really loved this Tristana solo Lane for no both hanser and frog and see if the band's even targeted I or if optic are unconcerned with that picks so far so Johnny finds her way into this game eventually free Band Away along with some other fancy are no hard engaged for big with a nautilus that's a really difficult one with the point-and-click to deal with even for something like Brom you can't you shove your unbreakable Shield underground and type of bridge the depth charge so that's one of the few things I can get past them and you going to see a lot of Champions been at a big fool his most played Nautilus was 7 that one's gone you and me thrash dropped off as well and left so Nerf gun player either so very place would be first time or only the second time I'll split as Olaf joins the jungle bands at Contract hear one of his more play Champions by year as well as the cover is not lease it definitely would be with their breath so let's check on Lee Sid this is so dangerous that take a lot of wrist and contracts take that to a 10 if you could do it will have a lot of Austin highest at on the tibia basically there for the day I marry much doubt it because I got a lot of wealth and health regen this makes it very aggressive Fargo's in looking for trades and the first Draven hover that so often Arrow does like to play biggest fan down to Leah coming back I just saw it from this key coming back here already asked who he have his his trademark champ of the world in full and I liked what they saw it with that clean Cloud 9 team composition the roaming early on from this key so effective for C9 and Crown thinks he can do it as well I honestly think the optic have looked best when Crown has been roaming around the map making plays very good last champion form to log in and frog and we'll have the DPS machine working on the history of playing till I think back to Samsung Galaxy when they won World a lot of Thalia games with what he was known for Roman to his side Lanes getting his teammates ahead and now he's one of the more individual carry standouts but back on Comfort he was going to be exciting one definitely so and not to mention last game as well if you have a jongleur with a flash guarantee knock up that does me easier for Juliet to Landers Dodge makes up its not as sweet Jarvan because if Jarvan flashes for his knock up he doesn't land extra damage to your combo so it's definitely a little bit more work to be done here by objects but they are facing a heavy poke contradicted from the side of golden Guardians with the Ezreal Corky trying to scale Up in Smoke and then gain play pharaohs even I count as a form of poke so golden Guardians will be looking to scale it up and make it into playoffs last game everything on the line for optic and Golden Garden the got to lay it all out a Year's worth of work in the chance to go to Worlds rest on winning this game to win the ALCS on this button counter logic gaming the first round the best-of-five you got to win this one to claim 6 place and move on for the players loading onto the rest soon as they step up but you've got a couple of Samsung Galaxy on the one side like that a lot paying homage to crowns old team World championship-winning Squad and we are by the way where snowing so what do I do this game will eventually start all right quick analysis of the early item purchase contract has a deed done with the hunters machete interesting idea of their from the jungler freak all right well we got some time to feel so awfully instead of I would go to that machine thanks guys job you have had such a long day but if you and the team starting the day and now you have the final game and everything comes down to this match after a year of missing playoffs just by this much for optic so is this the explicit optic makes it also be able to answer you know it's like did yes we will go out to like even the last team in the league is still holding super hard but you sometimes you didn't get the result We Have Some Loops CT on their game that we should have one that didn't do this morning was very unfortunate like the game was pretty much a screen that usually make but it wasn't a so you can I know we have to like Wendy's game but I feel like the guys mentally she's pretty good and we're confident now it's and it's just it's going to be so let's hope that they have the right mindset is there anything special that you said to your players before sending cost of a stage I don't have the right stayed up in camera because it might be a little bit to the car but but best of luck to you in the back to the casters it's a very much awfully I already said go out there and give him a good fight word for word for word I like it it was in French it doesn't translate well yeah yeah yeah I feel like that's why I yelled at from the audience yes that's exactly reason how many French swear words do you know free I only know one side and it's not very bad at all you don't say I'm broadcast or if you really want that one so we're not going to bother seeing Axiom sing the alphabet. We're going to be the opposite of getting in the right direction far as I can tell is busy every player has left and now my game is going to close as well but soon enough we will get ourselves back in yeah it was just a small are therefore I can has the wrong Rune in a game like this you obviously cannot send someone in with a wrong Rune we have to have both teams Optimal Performance here everybody needs their fair chance to get into playoffs there's too much riding on this end. So one of the things he talked to him since we have a while for the game remake here. About the pressure of this game you know it's going to come down to the details and how well they can perform on stage this game is actually full of Veteran we have so many players with very long histories appetitive League of Legends here this is definitely going to be one of those moments where the high-pressure leadership is really tested frog in the guy on your screen there that would think a bit of League of Legends before the LCS existed that's true coz you playing in Korea as well is definitely traveled the world significantly and made this a very successful career that's the case here so looking at this right now of course we are keeping the same pics in bands has won the draft on your screen right here Champions reorder to the roles of their in and take a look down on this one I mean this is this thing about the the types of play you want to see out of each of these plays when the golden Guardians hanser has been an absolute Santa I would say the best for a member of the team he got his matchup Gangplank scales very very well and good matches laning phase really good also he's got a really good earlier as a chunk of the lease in on top of him as well and even though he doesn't tend to get a lot of Latasha really from either side he doesn't come out ahead in this match if not better than Avenue where I think ggs can definitely get a big lead and as long as he is safe to split push farther down the line with his back was just on a game we got to lead and couldn't do that I feel like he's set up well to take care of performance meanwhile again yui talked about crime and it's only at the very beginning of this draft and I think that's another player who's going to really stand out here yeah Thalia is a very very important Champion early on in the game especially waveclear you can push in the minion way very quickly and go Rome to those silent to help make plays especially important to have good Synergy with your jugular and meet us another one of those better went alongside crown and with the driving those two looking to combine for a lot of optic success over the course of the summer split it has definitely been true throughout their ups and downs these two have definitely cared a lot of weight and we expect to be true in this game as well driving by the way one of the premier junglers on this patch has moved up in the rankings with a couple of the recent nurse to the competitors I just to keep you updated on the stage right now we are having to the draft 6 chance of a locked in and seven have been banned so pretty soon we will get the rest of this crap you see on your screen locked in on their computers in a load back in the game and shouldn't have any issues anymore as we ourselves forward to the game of a day it's almost 7 p.m. here in Los Angeles and I know a lot of these teams have been here for a very long time by optic I believe I heard went home to refresh and then I came back to battle the last two hours of their games and I hope that they are ready to go in and finish out this yeah I'm taking a break going to reset is definitely important throughout the day I heard from all believe that the cloud nine players actually half of them went and got haircuts between their last Cambogia and the tiebreaker game so even your changing of the outfit coming in with a fresh look definitely could be the case your father picked I've been locked into the 40 second countdown timer ticking down and then we load in so very very soon we get back into the game out of this one then I do want to do it for me to come out big on his first board game of the split so many of his chance got banned away three Band 1 pics 1 North and so he's down to the bar here I want to see how well he can do Bart you should have a favorable interact with Brom shield and Sons at least yeah and it's also very good against poke opposition's we mention the Golden Gardens are trying to do with their team Bard ultimates can set you up for much easier flanks jarvinen aatrox can have hard time sometimes you'll getting those hardened gauges on to Azrael Corky Gangplank kind of difficult Champions to get past a Brahmin too but if you land a good Bard ultimate that can be game-changing try and set things up so we shall see ya they can use it and when you have a champion on your team that can create to rain it also helps a lot so Thalia ultimate can be used to try and Corral the enemy team into a good Bard ultimate and I can be really scary here and you did not much range right like you do if not the screen and suddenly goes nowhere to go close them yet and I have them all those things available going to be pretty excited when he dreams of the players have loaded back on in the rift the time for the last game of the day the last playoff spot up for grabs optic gaming and golden Guardians 8 and 10 to close at the regular split tiebreakers
how do you super aggressive players who winning in Damonte do they will challenge you mechanically challenged your decision making and some of the bottom teams have not been able to really answer that have not been able to be able to be as a result they often lose a pan can so it's going to be exciting want to look for fans at either team both squads are in control of their own Destinies Clutch Gaming very likely appointments back-to-back to the god of Thieves in the gut Golden Gardens in the worst-case scenario or at least in a tiebreaker in very good spots winnable in both cases it's going to be a very tight by tear the club gaming fans dropped out that one of the others really you mean how did you start dropping off of course you ban Rumble that could happen every single time but the paper that wrist gone as well and beans instant is a lot for Cody Sun potentially their band out again soon as well and I do think of the top like it's going to be so critical you need talked abouthow we saw in a strong performance from estate guys last week you know that was big deal to step up against the attempt and I think he's going to have to have another really strong performance because he is going to ask you if he's the guy who is going to make risky play who's going to go aggressively at you don't really no matter what he is playing and thank God has to be equal to the challenge I was going to make sure we can settle for that one they work on taking away is he Darvin grouser Leon S another aggressive champ comes through for a clutch and when you are you Siri or you can just actually gay straight on to the reconnaissance Blake actually follow work on the when he's trying to dip out or go in for that engaged and you straight up just lock him down and burst him out so really powerful and Gage here already coming out for Vulcan I'm going to excited to see how he will execute on this because you are already going for big is a risky draft yearcan you play a fly lives are on the line but that is how clutch plays in and you love to see them kind of sticking to their guns definitely I think a good choice right here also want to point out there is a positive interaction between caixa and Leona for the Leona Davis Junction on the W now is good against those missiles that hit so many overtimes in each one removed a little bit from the W so that's going to be a little bit of extra tanks. Therefore Vulcan of course Target remind me to squish your back liners with the rest of Team engaging but you know in case that happens to be changed you the address so you know big first pick be right out here by Vulcan a he was always so good on those Indy Sports when they were more meta a very good alisar player I remember you know especially back in Spring is instead of playing that quite a bit or earlier this flipper half but you know I'm so excited to see how this is actually going to work out no, I certainly some of that you do have the temple to dive onto and actually burst out and you have to rememberall the Leona CCU buys time for Cody sent to their feathers over worth you know over top of that Target and then pull back through for additional fees Steve vandeweghe was jamming to keep you really where she is on the Hootie and the Top Lane although both be into my pee have played at 1 so that to remain flexible and you think Jungle Band tonight at the use of course they have that Jarvan and now waiting to see what band want to lock in for the squad of horse Corky or the most common Champions this patch is going to be the likely lock interview get the jury complement Leonard played by Far East 7th Corky play next most played is two games on Victor so you know pretty much anytime you leave it up you have to know that for you is going to take it it is a matchup that use very comfortable playing into against easier and it certainly a lot of fruit do feel that it's Porky favor I so if we were to see that kind of standard matchup midlane Arie would be feeling very good about it well class going to go down the well is that okayyou're supposed to love you never know that seems like the most clutch thing to do right here is there a blast at the ospital and then see what I'm at the top when afterwards but they got rid of the competition hunted these will let fit got to get a kind of figure out some of his most prized fix haven't taken away and let you structurally A big one for fake God has been banned out but waiting on this last pick it will be probably to this back almost more like MSI metal with the flex pick solo laners you know we'll see if this is going to be a collie top or a colleague mid lane when he had a Great Khali game last week no absolutely popped off that was really really impressive in that performance so I will see what they got the answer is going to be because he has to really be comfortable playing into either one of these pics in knowing that lira is going to be playing this gragas differently has some very strong potential but obviously is a great answer honestly to both are there so many dashes between the irelia and the akali drag his body same can be rejectedI do believe you feeling rejected then displayed all of these things connect to be shut down by fake page of Douglass book a little bit here and grabbing the poppy by poppy a lot of course keep mine if you blocked any of a Colles kit you're grounded for 2 seconds so nothing else can be cast as she tries to run around or fails to do is going to be exciting when he resigned the thieves have locked in their life and I really do like to look here I think they are looking solid but again Clutch Gaming 7 in 1 vs. the bottom five teams not been included odds are they're going to look good here they've always been very consistent at being the playoff bar and they might just do it again here as they can no longer push camping ground Hootie is the akali Demonte is the irelia to see how much is Lyoto could you alongside Zion the bottom line has a better chance Papa John's Pizza near Elliot does a really really a does going to struggle into that match up especially in the One Thing 1 and Thing that's always going to be nice if you actually feel them are if it does come to itbike damage is going to be the side which will be physical damage that perhaps God will not be as prepared for all right well time ticking down it's time to do who can make this one happen in a playoff spot on the line two games left to play for only half a game behind the fly off bubble half a game behind thick Owens put you in position both these teams have control of their playoff Destiny's we'll see how it takes shape as he leaves at least we got the lifeI burn to be on the map right now yeah yeah right now it's a dance party Apple trigger words come down at these actually are spotted in this Montague's do press all the emotes in real going to be playing klepto once again has really been enjoying that in a lot of these car keys are going left owing adamante does actually end up letting him get one little Auto off there and I really have his word I do want to hear something from you Artemis going into this game we've had a lot of one one week finishes for CG so what's going to be different this week to make the 200 that you so desperately need one of her preparation the same way you want to change too much but our CEO Michael came in and get a really nice pregame pep talk so hoping that was helpful but we really didn't play our game I think we're super confident both these match up both of these teams we match of great again so as long as we play our game will be fine. When that at any energy for you to be honest we hadn't really been paying much attention to what's going on we know that if he went to the games that we're in for sure so we're focus on ourselves and everything else interesting interesting well let's hear some more noise from are casters thanks very much loud noises here hello audience than hello fellow gamers are some noise I love it thank you so much you are I am also gave her ass SS I've seen it for gamers in Hunter these Gamers here and we're going to move on cuz that was terrible. That was very fine back to meet lady here is that we will be having fun in the early games email a message with the car key can be pretty annoying Courtney has pretty good push with phosphorus bomb especially in a really helping take on a w in and then you while you're doing what you can threaten all in Cork used to be definitely in his comfort zone part of the gameplay pattern just yet that comes in a little bit later but still putting some blows and that is who in the only option one CF the first week and we'll see how much I can get but it won't be 18 fake God certainly will be at the receiving end of this Lane for her for some time but no that's fine because he's going to have a lot of a lot of utility in team but you know what that W3 very very effective and not able to connect with this done there so he's taking definitely the worst into the trade and try to set up a potential fries to force out a Teleport here and he will be able to get as long as you have those words Arrangement is outside of range of the turret you are going to have a pretty effective freeze going on in the Mid-Atlantic Demonte will have to try to stay around it and shove this in that's what's going to happen right there in that knows he's safe I don't believe they spotted Jarvan in a while but you can see he's just sitting there brush make sure that probably give you a comfortable and Powers a w look Seattle tax but knows he needs to be afraid of what he might be doing that we could be over that wall and Sample that would be a lot of damage getting bit in not just on those two no game and now he's made his cut down to only two but it will not freeze in a pretty good spot to see if he has to actually spend at L4 he's just making the run for now and going to have a little bit of the formed and slightly when he does go back to base but things are going pretty well overall even across-the-board Simoni only really notable difference is up in that Top Lane Tennessee sa-4 hunie my stuff right there such gaming feel like she's down and gold overalls with squad for youth poetry isn't raining pretty heavily and doing a good job with that one. Of gold earned 120 from that course he's not too bad you can see the match of difference right there as soon as the entire difference in this game although it has a way of making me a liar yet again amazing go towards coming down here trying to track whatever earlier might do and you can't even see there's there's a lot of emphasis on all this Vision on the bottom side because of the dragon that is actually responding right Aldi's worth in this area to set up for the ocean Dragon which is just about to spawn that is really the highest priority Dragon these days in the early game a hundred want to try to and it will see if they can actually get laying control I could try to look for it you know maybe even if you wait a couple minutes or it's even if I do believe that at the first package for 40 and that is always a great time to try to make that initial play two words neutral object has because package really does give you so much additional power and it seems like to go on packaged so we'll see if that ends up being the power supply kind of fees need we just saw Lira try to sneak in the Box lamp it recorded so nothing happened for hims waves are for your back and forth + 6 PS4 bank so far comfortable Sophie's Valley North Bend scale quite well and we have to track how Leona is actually going to be doing right you know this is combat that work on counter picks really why was grabbed up and we'll see if they're going to be able to ever actually finding gauges to try to make good on that or if it will just end up being more of a passive playing where the turn of events to be forced to try to match power in the teeth by see cuz we know where Khan is so consistent to find those engages and I do think the owner will have a more difficult time getting onto the carries for Half Denver Conley too hard trying to free the 20 minutes waiting in the wings yeah I think he thought they got back to base for sure but just hang around long enough and a pro taking the wave and the Leona what you could send up it's a free route for Cody Sun so half remove giving over an easy First Blood there misjudged the situation wow okay that's good money for free calling app for was just assuming that the Marksman is already gone if it's already gone you can do this but he takes his board stun into roof by the time for the Kodi sunroof those perfectly done there from Vulcan backing up kind of alluding to the fact that Cody sun gone I'm scared in a backing up for the reflex game cuz like you know when that was pushed in Cody has just finished complete yet baby is out of range and if it comes in all the CW I'll get back my throat is fine but the help her with her vocals like well juice on instant in to eat for the route and desire for the route and then he was CC locked until after as you mention misjudged the situation. I can tell you about wasn't able to print a grave mistake right there means a lot to me to come in through volcanic in the 400 so it's less would be as big of a deal but getting a early movie boots always can be nice that certainly does increase the roaming pendulum pendulum gauges that you can pull off you know coming out of fog up being able to get him rage and for that Dennis played in potentially for that ultimate know what he does hit six here so we'll see you can collect UT to make things happen on that bottom side to be feeling really good about that first initial kill but a minute Mark for Corky is coming up here would not be surprised if he were you actually go back to Basin and if under these want to try to play around this Dragon could be pretty powerful utilize packet for it when we bought my controller controller comes down by the drop off the vision away but hunted these have the most of their roster sheer as you can see if he's walked back down package I'll see if that retail comes to make more that happen if you can see how amazing is taking down Trump feeling comfortable himself is continue award battles Rage with his bottom River ocean Cricut mats in not yet taken out if he's really trying to keep tabs on it so you can see bang every once awhile to DSW over there they're trying to give you your reward over the wall a clutch want some Too Faced check into this now and they have a lot of power who need does Nya Style for Tuesday at top so Wikia 44 potentially but course he is going back to get package so now you have to feel like a hundred thieves do have priority in this 44 you know that actually such a big difference even the top when is trapping pretty heavily as well as potential for fake God to prevent who
stop is old teams playoff push instead of old teams in playoff bushes CLG fans going to be rooting for who he hear GPS support as you mentioned if C9 drops CLG lost a guarantee top two and a spot in the semifinals of we've certainly is gas so if you play over here that's been playing it a lot because it's actually probably the most played that's far this split his ethnicity has Broad Ripple ban against frog in here in Phase 1 from Cloud 9 so I'm very clear who they think the biggest threat is on Golden Guardian at least in the pic a bit now they dropped all threeabsolutely fun and have a kind of Pick 4 at some point but he's mine on red guarantee that they can secure it into a good match if I wouldn't do C9 play so what are these frog in finding out your former Champion so much that maybe it's not going to be as good as romantic as you'd hoped we have no cars available at those two plays that would be another one for him and it does get down to just one play froggy Champions below that with frog and certainly does have a very big champion pool and I am guessing it is going top but we do not know that and neither does Cloud 9 you can only guess just now it's not better in this world that I want to point out forMidwest used to be a thing back in the day Shadow voice 914 this is post patch a call ebw is only invisibility that means you play a Morgana or a LeBlanc or any other you can punch her down early and it's part of the TF Band by the way deal works against invisibility so strong to keep a collie safe and we'll see if it's Misty we've been very good at summer split or licorice has been very good for in the last year-and-a-half on that champion I'll work on getting locked in will just be desire or conduit I was on cloud nine locking a very strong bottom Lane pumpkin is already available as an answer was that play pop bot doesn't really matter if you get to the lake if you want to be able to come off as the fourth is just honestly I think silly make them sent the wrong wayclear will be the job until I got to go for their jungle pick up is when he's already take off cables do is Silas is already had to Jungle Band party that's been scared now you can throw a couple more and try to push him down that priority list a little bit more people here Exile Easton Bragg is nothing more than one place so far this split and I think a lot of those are not really play much anymore with Sarah for example least I'm getting off the next pass will do that in the playoffs not here in this one doesn't make sense when Cloud 9 just like to play Yahtzee right and you you couldn't definitely play that in the table. One knock up with the recondo making a little bit more difficult if they were hoping to go for that combo is there no last days here so not going to be taking off the table so you know concerned about the iPod Touch possible Donuts on can't remember to Sonic and be going top so they are going to be focusing potential bot Lane pics leasing will also be taken off the table so still lots of options for spent here and MimosasNapa taken away rek'sai he has to pick Saint Louis did play Trouble game with you play hack ROM games are still things like Olaf so if there are options out there but he's definitely pushed pretty far down in priority compared to the day for I wouldn't be surprised that you can just see it's Carter I think skarner is quite strong though he hasn't been playing in a lot of a great champion and we're going to see how it comes through is BGSU to pick themselves a couple more chance as they need to see their stool lands because I just wanna is flexible we need a mid-layer at least and it popped or bot Lane and looks like a victory will be to have her and I want to point out that picture of course has been played in three roll out a way to see what I want ghost yasso Destiny kind of wire do my only concern you are so hoping I read said that you have counter picks and if you don't end up with those Connor Pickney don't know if we end up with stolen advantages then you know they don't know where that goes doesn't really matter right nowArmstrong Cable leaders of the akali detox likely to get locked in here as well so they have their souls Lane blocked in it and you will have to see where a golden Garden think the best thing I could see each or thought you find a drug store in the potential to push but it didn't get locked in much worse carry for Tristana top because if your son is pushing you can get punished so heavily you know that the third hit of that Q I can actually knock you out of your Rocket Jump if you timed that well she got that you have jumper lie every time he app so that I can make it really hard and Flash follows or Dove called so I will see how they actually want to play this out early game focus it feels like we're Cloud 9 though and then go round things out with Karma and here in that unlikely to beat well if you're if you're reckless Atlanta right there but in North America car has been almost exclusively a top laner here so I think this is the lineuptake last 25 Texas T for sure what it is but it says I believe the way the fiver being set up right there licorice going to get me a truck to get to give me a call e-mail a heavy Fieri aggressive T4 seen I the only way is that please Diana's only so good at that surrounds the more and more you got to make sure you know where the karma and Karma chasing via call East is really a map of karma goes in the Middle Lane here for this for the night of specifically to repeal here freely in bids and Victor in the bot Lane for FBI States able mid laner who can be pushing in the akali give you lame party There Delilah is also I do think that no kind of soap Lake Worth worth topside you have a very defensive bottomley with Tom kench he was Wayfair hear from you I went to get the mobile knives with the E so now they're going to be able to try to place table on the bot side while Hunter has the backup all the starving cuz he is going to need that fuel to push and play this Laneactively I certainly could be bondable if he's pushing in and it is going to be able to execute HR and hail of blades Denso this is early early power with those rooms and certainly if parts are on the Tristana make any misstep he could get his card and maybe really excited watching the toppling fight play out cuz there's so many potential knockups to ruin the Rocket Jump atrox has for finish out has two is going to be exciting Victor so they are just playing this basically like you play Sona tahm kench so it's actually going to be who he farming well happy I will be doing the harassment until he's fully stacked the filthy so this is really really interesting you know if you can get that really felt these then you start farming then you start really kind of going well in that regard but it will delay the hex core upgrade quite a bit and then you're with her isn't really super strong until you've actually upgraded your laser so we'll have to see if it's been maintained that same old Power will do just about anything draftdo the narrow forward on this game thanks guys in Arrow exciting game especially in the bottom line we have FBI ballena for Golden Guardians going against the deathly the person that he replaced and in this game I see it is one that he's trying to prove himself so from your perspective what is this game means FBI has a lot of respect for you worked with both of them and Academy and that's like all my experience with him I know you always going to have good things to say so this is kind of a good chance to prove himself a bit but he's kind of been trying to do that for the past few weeks anyways I think the gamers doublelift was like a really huge wake up call for him already so this is just kind of like the nice one for him that he gets to play against the person you miss we competed against for the spot and I'm sure like winning out the really good friend inside and out so how do you see the sling going this game not really sure how the land will go over all of it it's kind of been a back-and-forth one from scrims but I mean Victory likes it a lot the Champions but he has the exact same name as in which has been a funny meme for us internally pretty good results in scrubs in Adel Jason likes it is something we playing Academy for a bit too so when is killing award down there and they have to plan another trip little while cuz I thought I could be scary and he's going to go to Waze contact really cannot fight him so as long as you're lanes are pushing on you have that potential assistance of this is going to look good for them so they're fading know he's around there is not even going to bother checking because he knows the potential that's been has in this one do you want you guys like me song over the key with the word you put down to the river so since I get out of court even saw him clear the war that ever itself though that's yours that's the matchup that yours goodbye took the Wolves Away Spencer and can't steal those little bit brown stew to can't take it and we'll see if there's ever an answer for contracts taken the Western jungle over to that side of the map because right now he is no pushing Lanes contracts in ways you can see this guy actually posting frog in Hunter you know his kind of neutral or or back so he doesn't know where he would complete the three-box would be able to farm back quadrant of the map as well would you give me a huge lead and thankfully for contracts Spencer and isn't yet aware but if it's kind of your opponent is doing contracts is it actually going to face assuming that's been staring is there so you know certainly getting by far the worst end of this dark contract goes back to base and he will have to Camp Celeste to get back down there course answers going to try to give him a little space here he's rushed the rebs might try to have a better chance to Monday 1 and that's as far as clean pots using OK is Contra left right now by the way I can stir up so maybe get a chance in the bottom side who taking the bill of the damage that one as well as a few shots you got fence going to still on the bottom side takes to Scuttle and they don't know he's here this summer and there's no war just bought this one since her nose no working to brush to get a get a zombie wear this whole time so you can be whatever just got a flash away and Billy will regen backup of December to spell down both got for who he the pressure over the farm instead of going to back up that top side and try to take as he goes for another gangster on the bus side is reward with both owners being taken off who he so this is totally reasonable Choice especially early game Champion you want to be active only making things happen and not just kind of allowing a Jarvan to do trade Farm in Comfort but that being said no you did this opportunity still fighting back and forth to the constantly you got who he down 2233 and farm so it is of course a bit of a difficult match a very good at bullying malate Last Exit FBI keep from this backup an FBI will be at working pretty but these were that he's done a good job but honestly even talking to spell thieves thus far are we can't eat Azazel exactly playing coin this is like we talked about last game you know it means that there's not as much pressure to action consoling poking consulate getting that harassment down so if you think you're going to take the worse end of the trades you just pick up the coin gold it is very consistent and you will always have that strong income from it and you get a lot of spam. She quite a lot and put the distant Shields and poke down so it even if even can be in some cases the better Lane Valley item avocado Cloud 9 pushing right back down after the Scuttle crab do you spawn to heat up has to be careful almost knocked up against the world. Of time and years FBI's TV and we know that there's no naka left for Azazel so as to be safe down here Spencer and looking around two of these walls and you the timer and take down to them as don't record coming down to help track the opposing jungler he's really making sure that contract cannot get down to the bottom side yeah it's like very heavily around that you can see a lot of words in that area from Cloud 9 as well this is a bushing laying here I from Golden Guardian I think he's actually looking for a black dog and cat they pushed forward I though he might sound kind of where he is we don't actually have Vision on that right I'm right behind that wall screw the blast cone coming in right behind who he there who had no flashing they get that kill and it goes to Spence Karen so he has the first Blood now on an early-game jungler and this is very intelligent there's no way really for who he to escape you have hellblade you fly straight over the wall that landed knock up who he knows he's dead to rights he does have Spellbook so he was able to write back to Wayne but even so sincere and being very proactive in this early and caught it so quietly and warming up who is going to be going tank and is a head now and experience because all this time Karen has been spending trying to get pressure on the bus side he's just been cleared camps and gold between the jungle is within 100 overall game is actually ggs favored in income the extra money to who he prints by getting the upgraded support item he's sharing a lot of that vs gold and topside right pushing and you know this has not been busy whatsoever so if you're left alone and no contracts is is protecting you enough and getting you fish in it since Aaron is not ganging you the trick is constantly pushing it was not a lot of recourse to that for licorice unless it was going to make that a serious misstep there was constant question and you will miss some of the CS2 turret and Hunter will continue to extend that advantage of the early upgrade attack speed boots you have any additional moves but I think it actually quite important in this solo Lane and if you do get access to that sure actually pretty nice there to definitely really good stuff right there thanks girl another blue bathroom - contracts
names of split barely Clinging On to fly out with that booty early today and he said he felt pretty good about how to split have gone so far that that the team the players at that falls over to come to both it was time to really step up when is last two games get the plastic it if we do it and they're hoping they can a lot in this final week as you said CLG fighting for that playoff I would be huge mean you go straight to Detroit guaranteed win or lose in the semi-final to get those all-important Championship points because especially if you were in the playoffs in Spring you need to get some Championship points need to be in good position for that, if you're wanting to fight for worldlocate right here so CLG fan away the Draven off the dropping off the atrox and I really am curious what does come through optic these beans and do very well on its way to Champions for the topping for dhokla H rocks and Poppy for the probably the big Popoff Champions there for him and trucks were to go gon do on a first pick in yeah pretty interesting and we have seen in North America the champion has been so much more popular than elsewhere in the world when you look at it as a major 5 Regent it was sitting at like no 40 50% presidents across the top five America has been extremely popular here and will remain I have high thus far not a big surprise you miss everyone by the way so no surprise to those ones dropped off a table about the still digging the trench Banning High present Champions that every teen wants to play and we'll see what I can come through more TaylorMade on each sidewhat would it be really interested to see if any of the teams have any big surprises worse coming into week 9 if this isn't kind of the time to put all your cards on the table and really fight to get a high as you can in those standing so if there are any your secret pics if there are any surprises at least you have I have to get the good time to bring them out no optic here if they were able to take down CLT to putting themselves in a great position to play often are we know that few ehat is a guy who has been known to for walking pics maybe there's something that you can kind of try to prepare against one of his popular pics if you leave it up to gaming sitting one game above the playoff of a one-game about 7 G2 Esportscould not win with Karen yesterday spoiler alert if they pick it and when they're better than service ruin I love Cindy the champion I want to see if lights even more often the LPS State maybe at Worlds not here yet though classic Warwick hovering there from Wiki Jungle by mediaocean of the question remains are we going to have hairy throughout your pain will get locked in so I will see if they're willing to try to take away desire that you didn't care we haven't seen you these last couple weeks or more and more work on your separate from the Sia in the path of it always been kind of the logic that Sia is the one that is the stronger individual pairing to write that first Who We Are by the play making that work on offers so highly that there's a number of what does play work on even if it's with you know Draven Hurd World whoever doesn't even matter we just want you gay if you could work on right now is considered to be best of the engage Boise right now to pick him over a love for over Nautilus over those other kind of options there for the engage support spell Ricotta's one they want the fourth easily causes Darvin for some forward motion that we could be steals you play aggressively 15 points dank basement how that plays out the first place for off the plane and most likely the jungler here is executing those themselves so they got this fixed it was most played the fork go in a certainly a comfort pick up there I just think that's what makes a lot of sense when you already see that hard engage coming through you don't want to play a low Mobility Barse then who can be kind of preyed upon by the rakan and jarvin, Azrael should help to stay safe and also your Nautilus can offer him some pretty powerful lockdown to work on it something that I've had a lot of it's worth talking about how does it have a pretty strong match if he is very switching Hotpoint go see see if he goes in a yocan Pokemon is it gay slang the route like he can just get blown up because you can lock him down before he can jump back out to safety definitely a lot of damage can be there in like a syndra comes through even for you to more of that explosive up front damage for Cirque on a lot better bass. Ended last year so he's a bit thank you but you can still blow him up in the band away from dope the medication has been fits on a top cod4 him I certainly wasn't all about the crust on in that game but it has seen a lot more kind of bands then pick this far and it feels like a lot of things haven't necessarily been practicing or preparing against it so they'd rather just take it off the table and there's the Poppy Van oil to remove top lend me his best what we've seen him do well with on stage but they're not the blind pick something it's used to get last pick in this game yes it's so interesting you know if it is just a lot of Champions with dashes then certainly poppy is something good to take away but generally I feel like Banning out ruin it is super effective because he has such an enormous Champion bully played what 10 different leave this split so you know it's always going to be something for him to play it is Instinct see optic take away the kind of two primary pick for dhokla at least the ones that everyone else on the outside is across 16 games at dhokla has 15 on HRT combine who played in the first place where it's like really that high that's insane and five right across this could be the 11th Champion played for ruining this game I did miss the thing ever got to be there but we are going to be seeing what comes through as we know it's the almost over, but who knows things around covering stona they are going to blame for power of evil the second picture pick his force on the most played this split and they will indeed give ruin counterfeit both taken away so you know what is I think I'm fairly safe to pick to go for you know there are some other answers of course up there in and ruin having counterpick we had such a flexible pavement full make a lot of sense I do think Victor here for the crown would be pretty strong mathways there with glaze clear scaling scaling in that they played new definitely adding a lot to receive vitamin Nautilus has that powerful lockdown make it very easy to land the lasers to have the Castform arrowverse office of these carries and potentially be able to force them down yeah I like around the champion a lot one of his signature pics absolutely and you can do it in the butt in gear as well as Optica the Roundup of composition did you make sure that spouse is in the right lane and they just got what do polls going to fly himself we have seeds inside. But Jay seems much more likely backup enable this week that's what he grabbed up his third base gate is flight for dhokla I would be interesting if they if they want to go towards it as an answer to Jay's I do think that malphite know can be pretty strong there are also we're together pics that people used to be pretty comfortable with back in the day when it was more popular we have not been seeing a lot of narva Rangers raised can do quite alright who has so many options that will actually be the rumble all right then going going for the rumble here do you can itemize into the armored quite easily and then start to get very cranky going through things early like Seekers like a bee does help you a lot what are the wrinkles be happy to take you into consideration is that Silas is going to be magic damage so if you do stack your armor and no HB other New York only fairly vulnerable to those Medio skanks but if I certainly does have powerful wave beer powerful team fighting people like that is very much the name of the game gear for counter logic gaming solos with a Leo ultimate the easy setup coming through from the Jarvan as well as his work on and that is really where their bread and butter is going to be my 914 is the past where J's Scott lower Earley attacking me to spell power and we are still 914 satterlee rank of Shield is still incredibly strong on Ron both and got to withstand all of that Pope damage deal do fighting for a playoff biopic fighting for a playoff spot they are one of those sevens play for the windi I believe at least guarantee a tiebreaker if not getting out rid of your the dunes failed to execute here we go out of the rift as the cops are locked in Optics thing that's Okla going to feel comfortable on the Jason seals you giving ruin counterfeit say that Rumble is the kind of methods we want to have here anytime you want to see how often does decide to play this out as well you're there is always the opportunity to split push when you do have a day but you know with Jason and asriel you also and looked kind of go for these legality bills and his group at Oak and try to look for the cheap flights through that style of play they're exciting one playoff positioning on the line here in the last week of the year the last week of the regular season postseason on the mind the chance that world on the North America animated MSI finals living in those shoes would be great. Thanks again eight and eight hoping that eight or nine wins maybe even more to be enough to make plastic thing as Square Off you'll know Crown actually taking sleep but work you're so this this is how I want to say it was actually the first I saw doing it was Pee Wee and it certainly had been taking Fleet on on Victor and as well as some of the other Champions even like Oriana it does scale off of AP as well so as you get further into the game you can actually be pretty powerful and is going to help him to stay in through the area in the score at the Pope during Lane a lot of movement speed during the fight so as we still G engagement ring with some words down we had to say about his being and specifically Wiggly yeah I'm definitely shocked that we're doing is where I think you know I didn't expect to just one roster changes going to change this much about him but I did really good players I think the one is the president most Stephanie Wiggly though he just like I don't expect him to be as good as he is now and especially even myself just being honest like I was expecting to just start popping off and do really well I thought he needed a lot more time just giving office results last but but he eventually but 416 South one else yesterday and took the championship finals himself so the right person slot in I mean we had ruined flying over in turkey and well looking like a Playa Fly Over CLG they've definitely had some scouting and picking up players and how you can see Emilio's did start Stihl G's red so weakly is actually just doing in a vertical jungle is going straight down to the red that they had worked it out and we are going to end up in this scenario where it should just be split math I think are very happy to initiate this cuz they want to play forward this J's they want to be in with a J's getting go ahead of ruin it does mean yo big and arrow are going to play. Eventually be down here on this side but as real as perfectly suited to that so I think this is very intentional and make sport isn't there a difference here though is that the entire can't hear callers all the with a lot of golden experience believe it or not the big one had to leave because of Arrow coming over to stop him so it is going to be the same kind of hamster getting cleared out of gold and XD given over is quite different here and it will favor meet us in the long run I do believe as temporarily you've got one came up for Wiggly but I think it's still more to be done over all that media also get a little bit of a 80 gold whatever not going to be enormous by any means but certainly will be nice and you can see still continuing on that vertical juggling both jumpers will be able to grab a Scuttle outside quite a long time looking to try to threaten to dive gear Fourth of July will not even lose his life Force 1 early lease here absolute owl planter besides up on the knock up turn the flash to avoid another one stays alive still very far down do incredibly important that he was feeling pretty doomed because we'll be able to get some nice folk down on ruin but he needs to support him a little bit on the way out and it overheated to know where is Lowe's coming out and they can walk away earlier they get big very low he's still to actually have the shield and he just gets worse down arrow though could trade back on the way to get to very low and then watch this site that file Frost go sonography steps back out of it dodging through then weekly comes over flat out of the flag and drag the turret shot gets the kill Arrow just play that out so damn well and the TB in response there from Crown was fantastic but child support Bill Clinton was actually behind and is forced back to base and off of that wave because lately had ended up in that Top Lane and and was kind of threatening a potential dive at the game State now it's 600 in the lead for object about winter on August the important for that one you want to go on a biofrost one who claimed First Blood and not as gold synergistic as maybe a diet would be so tell her it's a little bit there on this LG side certainly wasn't so I can just sense though I had an especially before his base you know it's barely even there now and he make sure he will get a Shame by so that is quite nice giving them the additional combat power there are you conceited Oakley exactly rushing toward the hex Drinker where ruin is going more for kind of help style of Bill likely working towards Julie Andrews early on and I think is make a lot
really you can absorb some people put them or they made things actually scale off of your radius bike Saint Pius giving out your radius and things like show gas attack range in malpais brown Slam in his ultimate like the more that actually does apply for what your character sizes but then it sucks because we're just getting to the really big tank by doing their armor stacking about go a bit better so it's on you know you can call the city of ether their support is being replaced but otherwise game jerseys that as they play through the summer split of CB loftswell is getting bad and I like we've got soda and where our City's old is Donnie passing themselves r o r o I don't think there's anything there but you got licorice yeah I mean broxah had a run in the tournament didn't go as far but liquor is he was playing way more 1G ones than anybody else in the ALCS before so I'm having a great time here already warmed up for the update I think that heats hendro both the man with the most enthusiasm for Brazil in the team is going to be going head-to-head to the guy that has just had some really pop up games I think the one he had against Catholics against a boy with Cassiopeia was the most exciting one do you want we had so faryeah it doesn't. Right here early since ever I like that liquor certification Ali I wouldn't blind the Champions League singed I don't think you may be in League of Legend lights up there a little bit as well but when this is this is how can you counter him if he Proxes your lane every time if he's always proxying the counter never is there T-Mobile I think was one of the hardest counters against AIDS and he's already gone so I think this is licorice is saying bring it and he brings forth the tank that we still don't really know how good he could be with something like the Ken tank now that is it's a real cool looking at it well I will say if you want to build the bilge is Riley's first Imperial mandates secondchunk of the side that one of the chances I can do pretty well in the preheated overall do deer is outstandingly strong twitch got a bunch of bus in the most recent patent which is totally viable there's a good chance it's a Pete which we be twitch jungle and put support a little bit as well with you you're locked in Autumn expect which jungle supports which is good but the possibility now more words Champion gear wants to face again so you could ever done anybody it's actually quite that it might be nice cuz you did get the bookI haven't seen it lately cuz that I knew it before with the old lady banging the new one I'm not sure how it's going to work out but you're actually playing someone that has to run at you against who wants you to run that a man you can't even tell him now that you got black shield to protect them so I don't know what this bear is thinking about but if anything level two gangs early game fights have been the motto for All Stars everything a year did time maybe 50. Flash Bears left once again 2 level 2 classic we get Lucian mid as well since I don't expect it is actually the Bible are they expecting Morgana support and so we're waiting to see what midday number going to be for the LDS projected abraxa meanwhile for CV long we're looking for a top laner Reddit supportK means they're banning out the wrecks I so that's going to be pretty useful for twists not wanted to give away his stuff and then the mouth is just so good against double a Visa Yankee composition has a good chance of succeeding in it that already has given me a bit of a buy it there cuz the more dank a team comes up with those are the ones you want to see when you want to see what can they come up with that is just so off the wall but still Victorious a brand France speak to me afterwards you got to be to damage output one thing that's really nice is since we ever really seen the brand update Both Worlds it is really easy to get like a 13-minute sightstone because you see the back line it will still spread to the other enemy Champions evil and attack them with ve and also the passes to get 30 gold right awaybecause they buff to those filthy Simcoe to be worth more money over also you have to just get a huge influx of cash while playing brand support you're going to be rich and recites known as you're going to sleep pretty early on and also as we get rakan and Tristana locked in that is gray and I also want to add to your brand brand doesn't support is the kind of champion that you can go 0 and 15 and still do more damage in your 80 carry at the end of a gap which is I think the valley that you're getting out of him run it down doesn't matter if you're providing all the damage no Dairy sleeping really really heavy traffic into sin to look at so lucky with like a 55-45 the game is 5545 D cause of the magic play Soul a Christian had a really hard time you mentioned earlier crumbscannot Lane against Ghost wife. Soda level one in base level 1 invade is the best way to ensure that you get a side of the map controlled and then you can start practicing a Non-Stop we've seen it happen in the lck Matt said yesterday where teens were just send the night Crossing each other in the jungle it could happen here again to level one of their quite powerful with all the routes and Flash done that can be delivered to this weekend work on a bit of course you saw his real work on with the eventual Watkins so it is going to be a fairly safe Midland or going for primarily waveclear what I saw in champ select and maybe they swapped out for the timer was that tactical was on the recording for Jake day was on the Ezreal if you want the LEC All Stars they have rolled swap once and then another time afterwards it was I who played his own role as you can see that indeed is going to be going back he's going back to his roots was formerly from about later played in the lck played on dignitas in the LCS went back to the lck the mystery role swap to supportand went and you know what the World Finals than one world to support on Samsung Galaxy here we go invade begins flash knock a big damage find plane goodbye at 5 around to rock jumps Lowe's 3in brtt time to run away tattoo go to heaven W pretty soon call JJ's on the board again they're Relentless their tactical knew exactly what to do you think or JJ do the flash knock of way too many times did not go for it himself and he was going to happen they saw it coming but the branches did not expect that will quickly blcs reacted forgot to Jungle that's the part I did not know more jungle was a thing I got to correct myself on that one I got to see if it's even pop of the road to pick rate in solo queue is critically low top play it's not bad so it was run a few games in a cademy the ALCS last split so there are sometimes where you can run it to clear is decent I mean what you're really trying to do is get out of gambling and get grouped with the team right that's what you want for you to Morgana anyway then I just respect the fact that they actually squish the real cuz the Champions look so standard but the roles and who is playing who actually makes the Champions more exciting broxah course losing time as carrier runs around and is going to be counseling topside they are and should be hard to find a kill that you can fly every time a good email use after is letting them know that this is a big waste of time and do deer mean on the top side just farming away just having a good old time making sure that is Buddy Darius can do whatever he wants up against it sent you has yet to touch a single cream help all that much if you can't Triple A baccarat that's worthwhile but I think it's so unlikely that you get any pressure because you can't force a full Health Center's to die but yes all three cans going to go to the topside rocks play for his team. End early control board in front of them blue and you can see it on the map is a controller right above carryout and that means that box I can go and take a bunch of his own camps you can kind of match camp for the most part I will see how it plays out in the crisper solution about what they want to watch for for sure two knowns the easy MVP of the CP law will see what I can get done but we are getting all three camps Abraxas so no cancer being lost yet and no cancel. But then it's a jungle Morgan that is not a carry junglers I would put all my eggs in the voted best player of the sea below here but I think Gage from Jensen. He is not having a good time he has ever get out of here yep GIF the first I thought I was sparked by Jensen you need if you get the flu shot off on Tristana if you explode the charge you get a reset on Rocket Jump kill or not it's not allowed him to get a bit more done right there he'll flash burn brtt spell shield comes down in time anyway and yeah you got to walk to wait for this one is really looking for the opportunity that to get that kill the flash of need and walks away is that is brtt for the shots that is a painful one over Diamond Tactical from Cibolo looking for the tier stand up flash bear slap you got no help you trying to run you try the one as soon as long as backup he's got this if you got poison licorice founded with the poison and takes it down so worth it though they wasted so much for that Midland plant Ginseng with a slick flash over the wall that's really the key play he making the Flash and buffering the Rocket Jump just it's so much for him they did not expect that he is going to be so prepared for that be safe so that felt like a little bit over over cost but you still can't hate on the fact you got to kill you forth with her out just the same been going to survive cuz of that and it looks like it's e v Lola is just still in this and why Relentless remember the early game was so brutal in your account organic this is it this is what they want Eazy by now but they can't re-engage the Gutierrez around at at something really low on health run away but carefully walks into tank Decor at The Runaway going to explode the damage here we just going to be okay and help us are running low if you don't land the engages bring a wave is so fat they really want to commit to it and they have no way of diving in if you saw how old is Ray Morgan I interacted this whole time it was the saddest thing I've ever seen for a new deer jungle he was chasing her from the top of her own Lane Tree buying dinner just not able to close the cap this is just a really sad bear this whole game and he is so slow you actually have to hope that you can get ahead and then start Max in your barracks laugh so that you can start moving around the jungle faster and chasing down two people that are a kite you could damage that they are nice little pillar of flame there. Phil gets himself some healing available if you can see us getting a very brief respite but let's 36 256 in csuf liquor got to roll off hey well done good job but I mean came in a lane with two free assist with an extra gold and you know he's down for UPS with a wave to be claimed I just got to be rough but he's read the proxy he's got him at the items you got to swim with pretty easily I think it is straight of outrun level 1 DARE stand 2 tier so licorice has a bit of room to play with yeah is that way they catch him even know what they're all in this top side of the Jungle Book just can't bother dealing with it he's just a big fly in the side and this is beautiful this is exactly what you want to see an exeggcute to just he might give it to you in a way it's closed because like Brandon's nearby he'll get the whole wave and a half a little for that and ensure yes the waves are all gained yeah slippers able to get you know I promised though he wasn't having a wedding is Darius but that is not to be given away which is beautiful you don't think it was worth it I think you kind of have to do it anyway but you are trading gold for experienced right upright it's gotten but you just gave reacted to support like those are those are relevant costs to trade off that's a totally is it you're just hoping that the brand continues to die okay okay it was a known proxy, but that was that was really not to kill at all there is no flash fares up available I think he's got a rocket
you still have to make sure that they're playing their absolute best and really performing when it matters so they must have lost to the first time around this place so they have to make this foot and they need to start with a c instead went right play at full power clutch shows up at all today as well. Leonard display it yesterday broken plate it would say has a better game but no really something that that I think he's quite an exciting packing and come popping up in the meta quite a bit yesterdaysee if that makes it any worse than this game is that Ronnie is available easy grab right there an amazing we'll have some good to us a very fast couple of texts are Broken Blade having a laugh as a trois and gragas you get locked in I wonder if I would grab yasso as a denial even right cuz as soon as the gragas you're thinking. So I'll see you having to make the decision to do we want it or how you want to play that out if you're really expecting something like a Renekton actually can be a pretty good pick. Up alongside has been wanting and very strong in that one you wantthat way to seal a priority right now I want to standard by cops going back to the middle and there's no guarantee that CSM does actually go for the ah so you know you're just thinking that it has it's certainly a possibility you know we have played in this combo play bot Lane we have seen it obviously played mid jungle it is going to be CF so do you also or just yet but then did have one yato game in which they play Dragon Ball that wasn't a lot 40th now but there is still a possibility if it is left up to be picked up later on and don't you have to come here for the most play the champion of the split pic number for for him right now outstripping is it the year in his earlier on in the summer split now September 2nd band phase what we got right now is some disjointed fix note op 1 and 400 no done work sorry no supportpicked up for TSM so we'll see if those us gets try adjusting the clutch band that you were referencing earlier on that was not going to be allowed to just started with that feeling debuff now added to the second part of the Q I can be pretty effective against that a frost also pretty good Mobility wise using Scouts actually died out of those sweet spots to hike then actually coming through here so I guess play Pike this year through a bunch of support bands in and you can do it earlier that you display the gragas gospel bottle and I got to follow along the entire time so that's still going to be thick or not falling for example it wouldn't be that badhey you never know things to do around will be another support fan it will it even matter if I can just pick another band so they are not expecting that you got to go by at least just Seattle or perhaps you know daring PSM to actually go for it so like Dipper X Kenshin completely normal. Like just play it would be fine with Sony bandeau targeted towards bottom Lane with all these before I send everything that we may end up with such standard meta pics of regardless but thieves now going to be having their choices year as far as a d and top to round out their composition I'd like to say will actually be the Renekton it looks like the air for fake off-white good Renekton is a fairly good matchup and if there were any the crazy things happening is going to be a fairly standard match as I can reallyplay well against anything else things yeah for sale in dispatch got the healing added to the most pristine about lamp it going to come through so I know they have been more kind of like all right you do your own thing you survive but it does feel like that would be the best place to go as far as a gangster and Lee Nautilus going to be the lock that will be gragas jungle for Acadian Nautilus and silver as their bottle liners and that is a lot of engage cancel their silver altimate rag that has been passed the engage Nautilus point-and-click ultimate that is going to be really strong there isand it feels like you know that this plan is going to be more like a 1-3-1 style for CSM Fred the map using your GF using you're a rotten and have is going to three man squad that has a lot of strong what is there anywhere I feel much more like this is a group 5 looked at the bifrost edge won't even acted really strong frontliners and some good bass line access from there to Carries On The Corgi in the air through the air is be back in a very aggressive of the map of Destiny an earth movement on the outsidewhen behind a playoff bye Toby get back that level of Excellence their fans back to the same as advanced as well let's get in the game of Thieves vs TSM and funny enough Acadian immediately as they loaded summoner's Rift pinging ocean Dragon spawns in at 4:57 so I certainly could be a big Target there any time it is a first dragon ocean you often want to play around that bottom side you want to be fine for that Dragon because you can get you know that five six minute ocean you're too being such an incredibly strong spot for the remainder of that laning phase do the teams may have to kind of change up their planet in Decatur what they wanted to do that I will have to be early game amazing did start with a very quick sweeper instead of the standard warning totem then most of the bills put down so we'll see if that gets wedding this ismap of the beers and played yesterday smoothie in his interview afterwards I kind of said hey things went wrong around Midland that's why the game was so hard for us and he was referencing the 2 V2 static AV embarrassing I did lose know where Mike young you came in on with your lease and they got a couple kills above your since spent really the rest of that game sitting under terrific getting pushed in on stopping it will see if piercing can make a match up with different today because he certainly was on the receiving end you know down heavily and Farm Walk under his trade him and wasn't really able to make the roomsand we are into this one with no crazy how to get to the early game not even towards slept out by amazing sweet person no extra games here is anyone else going to feel pretty gospel to get to the lands with no major issues looks like a leashless start for a Canadian on the Raptors but under these are going to help an amazing over there on the Red Bluff and that'll be pretty nice to him speeding things up a little bit you can also noticed klepto versus klepto there in the mid lanes over you and yours in both going to be taking that ruin in it looking to try to trade I was back and forth back up that additional gold we'll see who's going to get the better of the two in that matchup I'm just lost sitting so far back and forth with no major issues hold to First for real I'm not supposed to lyrics I can't knock him down just yet is now the level 3 full eyes I'm pretty chill start right now but the first place goes to TSM over the bot Lane yeah I do think when you see the ocean Dragon spotting early and you have severe Nautilus going on here expecting to have priority on that certainly is a lane that should be able to push that should be able to catch the cure an advantage down there they are able to shove it all the way up the turret and smoothie get the word on the cross so they know. Like the amazing is doing a full body side so that is quite a bit of information gleaned from the fact that they had that bush and get that one for you music and then kind of Killeen okay everything's going to be topside now for 3 minutes till you know about 3:45 or so in the game so now it's going to be Broken Blade up to be respectful of what amazing might do and it's it's not even that totally know that was gained they can see the Nautilus leave Lane but I don't know for sure what's going on but again is the point was given Brooklake should know he could be attacked now they should expect as many cops died and he is under throat and should not play aggressively here fairly careful there is no cry do before meeting at the energem go but if I broke my checks this nice for what they're just take that from him they're looking for this off the wave sew a lot of this yet it is a nice little move I do think I'm amazing was hoping to be able to get drugs and not going to be able to do so is that had already been taken away but you're going to miss the cannon that was about for range and one bill a nice little bit of gold and also you're not really sure is this a pointy film that pushed you know this is scary to even walk back to if you're getting paid of the Broken Blade will make the move now and luckily for him the meeting has gone back from his jungle so he's going to get the rest of this wave but yeah that is a lot of fun and very early on so 27 of 14 inch vs gold difference 280 right now and you also know that amazing because we saw crimes were down is going to be so far on top side of that so you know that he could still be hanging around that he could be in the river if the wave which is out too far this is certainly a tough position to begin as offline with the dragon down the bottom side you don't have that back up and you're Broken Blade likely will have to get up a lot of Cs as a result you make a choice what's going on here is this going to be playing right now it looks like has to wait around and in case this could have been delayed pressure he's going to be around takes to recall has about nine hundred gold to buy pieces of stuff as roadway. Feels more comfortable and get some really good rating off and pick up yeah that was really nice getting to sweet spots as well as that deathbringer Stans Auto know both feeling and doing additional damage now. Looking for has been great Thou shalt not going to be in danger really at all right now is through the comes back down the lane in a comfortable first TV came through Van Gogh have a Sheen has been blamed pressure as a result is going to try to make amends life miserable if it should be too hard saver basically already has Warhammer gold and was the next wave has BF Sports gold and then you can keep afterwards but then just held it until we actually saw the Hue animation yeah complete Felts field it's only proper play down from Justin and taking a lot of damage there no fault to be had any more of them finally make it back to the wall to go away but outside of as well and now it's Rebecca Lane I cannot do it is a little bit more dangerous if you want to teleport straight back in your dual Lanes will not be there with you but hundred. Then we're both genres actually were spotted on their club by Wards effectively so it definitely has a front chance to do that we already got these they're going to start dragons you know that they know they pushed it back to base. You tell boring bronze back to the dragon are they see Acadian now though it amazing just getting a little bit low so good leaders will be called over here we're going to play running break a little bit as important very low as being somebody wants to pull it out of there for the graph shows up and just know healthbars big enough for amazing they're there but they're going to give you the Casey's and get something more up already so that's just might yeah and if you don't get to go to order at all I mean that was a great job there by TSM on that collapsed but if I have to say I feel like a little bit of mismanagement on the egg or the dragon someone should have helped amazing to tank up that drag Force we could have stayed healthy or stay around reach out there by Broken by Todd and the ultimate and Brooklyn on you he mind game that you correct the heat went backwards the Q cuz he started to run for that was what happened right there as it has burned in this is Spain is now you can see he's got to be careful with the fact that it has the ultimate Advantage now and would have all that additional healing but likewise in a Broken Blade with Rio on this world there is potential for the die if your ultimate or not. A lot of health comes back The Flash in front of the Nautilus hook to the wall beside him there so things went very well here for kids on both sides of escape on the bottom side they got both of the stolen flashes in a failed dive on Broken Blade as well so TSM could be really happy about those last two exchanges imagine winning way and footing topside and the bottling doing better so this is excited I forgot about that flash to sew
can golden Guardian yes it is I believe had mentioned during a countdown open they can indeed play around Hawks the top side and we'll see what happens if the dress push forward and out here today optic no interest in playing against the bat and who he will have the novel's denied from him one of the stronger engage option available for support these days and play Bruno in competitive but certainly feeling that he has shown in solo queue and we can assume scrimI want to see what else is going to come through here of course these themes are you done fighting so close blinker playoff position very tight race you're mostly Squad the mystery games left to play in till playoffs the two teams who must make there was a flash of a chance at the postseason of a chance that you can play me something like World SO waiting to see what can come through here is that wrist band away from hauntzer just feels like they do you know do you know and if they're not metal bands whatsoever but these are two things that work pretty important golden guard and win yesterday that they both the Solunar that were played yesterday from Golden Guardian taken off the table but that does leave some of the more metal stuff up there certainly Corky is beer if I can be available aatrox now Up and Away there's a lot of options here for Golden Guardians optic as well I am always a fan of Target fans against teams that have fog effect I think it is the right way to runVoice contestant you meet or contest the irelia or whatever it is yourself as the anivia however does it get to get Wukong time he doesn't asriel if we walk did most prized bought leaner worldwide in the patch and locked in here dropped and it's not even close that mean even the top five reasons as last week 32 Ezreal text next highest 14 for Lucian so certainly has been Far and Away the most popular pick down there in the bottom Lane but a frost and other really popular take here is available can be grabbed up and we do know the contract and play aatrox as well so you always have to keep in the back of your mind that it's a possibility of a fight definitely has got ramen here as well finish line bottom later and we'll play a support Adesa Golden Gardens of pretty solid front line now in these Deep by tonsils not one shots going to drain tank for a while and obviously drum very very befitting their front line so poised to play forrent a picture in the back at cost price looking like it will be the graph again yeah by far the most prevalent mid laner Dozier up there as well but almost able to pick 30 as opposed to the 16 of his ear off Rocksino doesn't necessarily have to go in that direction he certainly does have a lot of flexibility in and actually hasn't brought out to use your yet this split so I wouldn't be surprised to see him go another route from the song Vineland vel'koz that is being tied for most pick for him alongside and Nivea so strongly has the options there TF has been fairly popular as well if you want to try to play more through those thighs lanes and then it's also another pic that Robin has shown on the right now though optic him he's talked about what their bands were the results are get fans are getting cream of the crop and be sleeping over your role of the most common Champions down that line really is the most popular picks in in all three roles that they've actually drafted for thus far you heard from talking on the desk about how he wanted to be video cat when does jungle power pics of get a powerful pick for Crown as well I think certainly has Delta do that. As far as going to be a little bit of a split as far as the draft priorities in this first phase as they will grab High stuff or who he's do the bottom line drafted here by Golden Guardians no jungler yet taken for contracts so we could expect them jungle bands on the way of contracts at try to give me. Even more of an advantage in that jungle matchup Top laners beer and there's the first one and Camilla is off the table is I'm very excited to see how this is real + x plays out against price of round they really want us Campion them made up of dhokla what does atrox what the hell I find a little bit surprising simply because I think that Poppy is also a good matchup into aatrox and is you know stove powerful for optic fiber do some particular they've had a lot of success with that pic so I would have liked to see that taken away and Trish Lee optic doesn't really play through their top laner fourth one thing to point out is what is a combo with the feds wanted that you can play poppy play strange but it is the afro top laners that's into the most once. I do want to plant with dhokla is it does have I believe the lowest difference in his gang for than he gets gang in the LCS and received from media me Focus as you stay on those errands Westside wanting irelia another one very strong alongside that evil stack up so you want to pass it incredibly quickly but gragas do you know going to be taken away to Kiev as well for a little bit of focus on frogging as well as contract yes certainly feeling I could have seen going their way but it doesn't mean that you know Jarvis is still available and they are actually just going to decide to take of late but is thought of as a very strong cancer to Stage 1-e how people talk a lot about the 20 passive what's Aftershock interacting with internal off but a lot of people these days for 6:20 or actually just for going there after shock and taking things long lines of hail of blades to try to dissuade Advantage going over to his frontal and I'll pay the support is going to be here for Big Bertha got to the Martian back line with the Ezreal for Arrow Decor key for Crown now dhokla have to pick into what can be a flexible aatrox we are expect that to be a top laner but very like they taken make sure they know what's going on in 4th Golden Gardens waiting on the Run bed and look at another SIMS On Golden Pond movie fighter options enforcement of a tank so very very big problem for optic and because the Corky and there is the vel'koz you brought up earlier probably pick the one up after all this killing his ear would do no vocals does have very powerful wave clear and it is going to be a great fighter makes a lot of sense of the dash very easily deny their from Hunter you can also interrupt this is something that not everyone knows that the class of ultimate actually count as a dash you can actually prevent that from happening with the W from Papeete abraam jump as well so those are all pretty powerful options and it's hard to bully out this Papi what contracts and as a result do not only Kenny actually steal those stats from meteos it don't those getting really take your to good ultimate targets I which is it helped him out a lot in the team fights and I do think that know if you get into those those front or back style the fight having trundle as well as the brawn for the front light these really powerful scaling back liners of Kaiser and Bell cause you to allow Golden Gardens to shred through the front line that has been built up here from optic a game right there a lie what happens as you got hide am the one stop a topic I feel like they have such a dream composition as far as Champion rehab to fix ya solutely one thing for big over there on Optik side but hopefully we'll still do a very good job there I've heard very good things by arrow and big playing together in scrims did them pretty well on maybe not quite few good reputation for getting them all ready to go into this game very very shortly office Mega win here golden god it's also funny flat top stick spot hoping to do it here in their game that's good to be a good one here cleanse you can see taken 5 fragen that is kind of paying respect over mostly to the sedge wanting you really do have to be very careful about that you know we talked about kind of some of the strengths of damage output on the golden Guardian side and using lighting trundled help burn through those frontliners on Optik but also has really powerful and Gage and strong back line here to sew for them it's going to be more about how good of games can you get with this or come with us Edge wanting in we're going to have to track that emidio's as you can see it back to Lane Crown will not go in a queue on a him but that is certainly a lot of punishment and they much longer cooldown burned away yeah FBI getting punished pretty heavily and I did not use the potion at the very least get a Sonos players will actually Panic use that potion to which then just heard that lady pays that much more but he will survive and not mentioned the hail of blades that when he does his ex going to be sleep but works at Sewanee so this is going Alpena cast a little bit more healthy on that clear up or meteos but again it is you know avoiding the Aftershock because you don't want to give all of his additional extra stats over the contracts you can actually go into negative resistance is well and you're passive Falls Dr. In North plus Aftershock tremble all to you and you get punished very heavily so I'm just waiting that pic just with the snapshot to resist and then just trains from there so you can one temporary about to fall off use fall farther further intervention in the negatives was actually a safety took the smaller camps next up early. Lindstrom is not doing too much just yet is FBI and get back to Lane without having to burn teleporter to the house so it take for 5 minutes will get that flashing all will be well and you commit a bush leaves are going to garnish will have temporary Lane Advantage even with the flash down to be a pretty good spot for them as far as the toppling match does going to do cuz we are expecting play fairly defensively it is mostly about going to win standing to push your from the atrox in the early level you can start a fight back later on as you get some more levels answer to pick up some items specials are going to go for a powerful fuel in tank items long lines of sun Fire and Ice born that can be pretty strong but he always has a really good time doing some of these melee matchup just buy actually staying, but with the minions and every time you're passive blockers of throwing that out for at each breast for I am really nice of course grass cause more on my computer's account as melee Gods Dragon Lands End the first thing I'm going to go down did not have a weight house and look at that first one comes through for Golden Guardian back to the last time they play but instead it is actually contracts getting the advantage this time around I seen was decided so heavily around bot Lane where it was actually optic that was snowballing arrow on his grave in medias was pulling up so many great thanks and this time contracts is here and they do get the edge going in for the engage was big butt contract those up there already low on health and he just get to Absolute lockdown losing the Flash and the kill he took the rest was the Cuban from Indian runs away and that was a level 2 recondo didn't have the escape tools and it had to walk slowly back out and it wasn't enough so that's great stuff in the golden Guardian Side Up in gold now fighting for more map control the top schedule dares to give me feeling so good about the fact that reflect on the FBI that is exactly where you want that to go on your thaisa going to be scaling up and that cure in the mid lane McKenzie Crown going to have this is actually a nice place you can have someone come of him who he was looking to threaten that room and try to help fragen in this Lane a little bit and I'll just try to remove some of the events that you get from the teleport because once you teleport back on the Courtney your volume locked under his try and make him take a recall that will cost him see us for sure but as long as off preschool dance available he's pretty immune to Bronx to be honest Safari told me to stay healthy here in this matchup who makes way back down has those boots of speed that is used to get to the middle in a little while ago and I'd love a trade but they're also course holding back on the puppy W course duration is lower as in the past has more impactful thing that happens if you can make it happen but that I was I was like those kind of changes you know it's more about the skilled person can you time it right you know right and you actually really get it just right instead of kind of just mindlessly pressing it cuz they're going to last long time so I will see how effective he's going to be with those but has been a strong coffee player and and also I think to his credit has been no good at playing in 2 weeks out of the map when when he is getting focus good friend of surviving and cut a minimize losses because his name often does like a flame War especially with this new bot Lane around boss-eyed and around their mid laner project for sure we can see what happens if it's just safely funny but of course it took lays down and farm 13 PS out better than you can see about a nearly 200 gold lead in that matchup is medial takes away the Wolves than contractors slightly jungle camp list but who he's on the way over there a spot out where this is going to get his sit around makes the q40 slow immune so right back out there no problems if they weren't spectacles 50 gold across the squad and then go back down to the links to punish a puppy Yoshi is going to be able to invade and now it is contract turn try to get over here so you will not be able to do anything about this and we'll just be able to figure out a little more Visions Amigos is actually a where know that there is a pink worth over in this rush but just didn't actually have time to clear it out so we'll see you win optic does get lien priority if they're going to try to go up and get that done but for now it's golden Guardian taking advantage of the fact that he had bid and bought Busch and now they're starting up in early infernal and with that record over the wall because you know someone is over their foot zoning board down as I don't know if I can guess this really does have its own flag but doesn't have is to know when to come into looks like gold the guardian able to place has one for themselves and a very early in front of right goes over the Red Sea how did Lane so he misses us PS4 too but very little cost there and go to the Guardians going to get a great skill in Dragon really early on run back out and going to try those blows without too much issue and once again that's just pretty soft for this
405 still talks too much about the 7-Eleven at curse kind of record in the architecture games above that prove they're looking like a legitimate Contender and very very practiced in their game against 9 EP plays as well as practice pumpkin ultimate to really get a lot of work done so I think there's so much for their fans to be happy about just like the fact that you've now curse them despite the fact that I lost earlier in the day, which gaming control their own destiny small chain slipped and fell mostly takes number one though they are on the outside looking in on that one sealed will not pick in the first picpaste piano strictly banned in the second band Faith as it gets later down but we know that the monthsurprisingly tall is Tiana the three most most place there and Cody Sun going to be on this differ here so priority over the last couple having some of that kind of used ility out of your Botley the beat up when you want it off and play very aggressively with the rest of your lineup for clutch to make them on the schedule for Cody sun is only seen outside of support role we see her Top Lane time and again we see her bottle and as the farm Champion for players like Fanatics Reckless there's a such want me for a very good as well.Planet Fitness going up to ruin it will be going to pick up the split so that would be in another Milestone beer for him he certainly has been a very flexible there I fit in quite well with y'all do you know pretty big part of their turn around this split in and why they are doing so damn well but still going pretty standard stuff you have a strong Daisy style of jungler and then I do think that you usually where you see the most out of craziness creativity from clutch is from there so lame and Tompkins is a great pic to help before that yeah definitely can be really strong can you play aggressively and my boys house looking around today do anything too crazy really against the Swanee as well it was Ben Swann Target left in tank it eat them out that go but if it is going to be bought Lane Parma, Caitlin is a very aggressiveI haven't ever really looks not harassing pushing this Duo setup your craft starting to ask someone to turn off lights in effective against the wicked release to the winds bear that was alongside of locks which are the champions box is probably exclusively a mid laner but I always a possibility sometimes games get nerfed in there than overlooked they still have some of the pranks that they would normally have but don't stay away from Demonte that's been his big Motif here is one from the band who come through for the Clutch Gaming side and and wait to see what comes in you can see the caste of an app for editing skills you did stick right side for this team besides election they wanted to be red side there so they are really waiting to make sure I'll ask him if it was good. I think it's actually really intelligent against the team that is out there like watch who is moreI have to try crazy counter Baker to try them them take her fault you know when you go red side you can actually have that last encounter pick every single game get the opportunity to be the one answering. So they don't just have really catches you off-guard to hear COC very much and want to ruin to have the final say even keep the karma make a noise like something else like when I send for him if that really comes through again spoke against all in so we can withstand the Caitlin Parma a bit more than you could last a little bit there and I still will not leave his view that you would have been already or otherwise and Elsa turn to pick up their top of the newest text champion of hereyeah we'll have to see what he does actually want to bring out you know he has been playing the thumbs UPS he's like that I need to win a game on it earlier this season so I'm bringing that out and it's looking like it you know it's good very well in a beat at Bard bot Lane leave, I'll send the top lady who can actually answer this Nico quite well known as kind of use the Millermatic too much more heavily a lot of rain. Just can't answer is just fine is not going to be The Bard unfortunately we will get strong so Caitlin and Brom will be that do oh well it's a really big meatball for two big carries the back line and they Carmen support all of it up to 20 bronze is a really really good tank setup to make sure your team fighting is good and Kate is beer has certainly doesn't they're also has the ability to actually follow up on CC fairly easily when you look at that is such want to eat son the past is done for prom as well you can still easily trap out of that on the Kaitlyn so if you are agetting caught by one of those see see if you can expect Caitlin trapped if all is well and be quite effective and we will have to see how she feels she is going to want to try to play this out and I do think I promise as about lying to me to now kind of no longer guarantee that they're going to have to put some pants can also push against is fairly effectively and usually when you see Caitlin do you want to see the bushing hours the threading in that way and I got farming evenly against Dipper I don't know if that's going to be good enough from the Caitlin so we'll have to find out I was too he was really going to go my instinct feels this is a little bit closer depends how much time between 6A can do cuz I feel they give last words and how the cops going to run with teeth look like and what blanks you should be aware of what lies you play to in Lake and we are ready to go to this one clBruce his clutch came and we are all the Rifts it'll be which team takes me on this one Comet for power of evil here a little bit more Lane Focus than lethal Tempo have a bit more pressure in a matchup like this but Demonte also going to be answering that know he is going to be going no more for it to sustain here so it's yeah that's why I should have put that bronchial and you can Flash following you probably always died so it goes down to get 10 free go to that one thankfully for clutch no extra board to be killed and I would say it was you if you overfill she'll give you find that but at the same time probably sells the flashes if then decide you want to come through I'm not sure I do think there is a chance you could have actually held the skill point levels spell shield use that on the Bronx you and then at the very least we would have to flash the flash likely but I'm not sure I quite if it said when he would have been arranged anyway yeah I think you're going to take him power karmic you regardless in that case and something's going to follow you and that might be too much do you have to win spell shield at 1 when you want to eat in W4 so I think it's fine and they're going to share 15 watch game and get a bit of money there and we'll see now what they want to do in this one as they help with that. Campus stole the chickens and I've no big issues and after all our talk about Nepali do to starting without glasses the silver means well you maybe don't get too pushy if you if you would have had that bush going on otherwise you have to play that quite carefully in this case and it is actually carry on this car my here so you'll going to war for those looking laning room we have seen a lot of klepto Karma stimuli into a magic even in some of the range math tubs just utilizing things like a nice are to walk up and actually trade with the klepto can be quite effective, but this is going to give some more Lane power and room will not actually turn on until he hasn't items are really going to get the most out of it without you for a slow does zero damage and well Lee restaurant to stock up via goats not goes for sarees I'll be worried already sweeper comes in clears away at war that was on his Red Bluff if you could either on the bottom side especially not his field trip in doubt those frogs and say hey be sure he's down there don't be too afraid of US 1 minute 40 second be final and modeling ice hockey scary down here long enough for me to get both certainly the attack speed from that Shrine that's helped out quite a lot of fire rabbit and I'm at the same time would we just clearing this up and we'll be heading up towards his is pop. Looks like it is just going to pull Camp clear here from Wiggly in actually clearing out quite quickly he's at right now that's a fast really clear General but yeah so far all looks pretty good for the steel Gees I think they got released from it helps a little bit I'm not certain I don't remember if I did see that but likely in any case that's kind of watch gaming are going to continue their mid-length send against of power field pushing in plenty of time to pick up so he's actually going to be closed or up in farm as a result if you don't have the Agro well and so far so good so we will be finished with that fix gas go back to base with you where he wants to go towards has pretty much every single said he doesn't it certainly has been if it's damn ball Frost with the push but again that could changes as things move forward as the flash does Come Back to the Future Cody said he may be feeling more comfortable to actually start should I play a little bit more graphically in and look for that bush 1 minute 40 seconds ago so count your clocks in its about 5:30 in the game he's back to full power but died before then then a he's not got all the tools he wants from self out Frost takes down a quick have it so far so good I'm both these Lanes, even though you can see you in a little bit you're forced to say and starting actually seven bit of that trap line mid lane going pretty well for Fue though he actually does for us at first base there from Demonte and as a result may be able to hold onto his own teleport actually just walk it back but weekly they're going to take both those small chickens that's supposed to go canvas little one so they're coming out ahead and go to the results of 04 still some of that money was taken away is ruined keep poking backed up his rooms and I got a pretty close top laying down there as well so pretty and really in the entire map is Boe has making a price taking his first teleport now as well as extra CR to feel pretty comfortable at the very least most of the little ones at the big one in you can Retreat now back to his side of the map where a couple of those can't that are responding where is going to be going mirror Star Theater for the jungler does they are both on the shellings might as well just started to look for dogs getting a lot more damage so far to Montana have a hard time with this one if you got some reason but it could be a second recall coming into very very early on is only $500 to spend that is not great no definitely not again GIF power people in other free read that he should be able to shove in this way and look exactly base without really losing much of anything there is there so there's potential we're trying to fold away for his mid later and instead of a breed by pantomime for the power we will stay around to grab the ocean Dragon what you going to do well for this lady with a sociology delete power for all Lenny face going to feel incredible off the how it really that came in here coz I could have the winning go up lots of fun when you get something like that because when is really does get amazing at that point towards the power of evil was feeling so so good in that matchup already in now going to be even better spot 3806 Liberty side steps to dig Boomerang play for the important part of the kit for the game and I'm going to stay alive here they just keep knocking down these minions have two waves reset UCF 3cs leave for 6:11 Dover power of evils of really meaningful difference up in that lane that's not very slight detour to nearest retail. Again stopped trying to look level six four layer of Flash's off the blue Smite around 2 is almost assuredly a kill in a room if there's not available there from Wiggly weekly ad that faster first clear and he spend his time actually taking the dragon will beer was so Farmingham still didn't get head in the experience and as a result April 4th flash season is starting to be able to figure out these days very quickly and as a result it's going to be a lot harder for 6 a.m. Christopher comes in eventually you can come out with that one one of these silver nurse that dropped her off of number one was increase Mana cost so maybe at some point you see that start to push itself through hasn't happened yet but a can of the future before this item to coming through game still very close and gold overall can let the gaming Prime position to fight for a second place spot in the regular season. Dating still balance for a playoff position to pay feel comfortable with the remaining schedule going to hope that they can at least look good here than beat their drug competition in the coming weeks are over the remaining schedule they do have guardians of hundred do you say that is a lot easier because my dude is that cleanse Tom Ken and so if you need Cody Sunday
map he might young and Laura Lowe have got to get more done if they will be successful I got to get them about my things back to his rookie split back when he was on Phoenix one he had better numbers you think back actually who Mike Young's rookie split what are the other rookies that during the same time was nisky to and then Mike young having a really poor performance kayak she has the lowest bass on his team across almost all Dimensions right now Katie a conversation even damaged so it's been a really rough road so far three in eleven in the roads are getting eliminated certainly going to be a rough road for them if they if it were to make it but it's extremely unlikely anything and it's not just within his demons really leak why do he has been the worst performing Douglas physically speaking at the very least so you're looking to see Mike young get back on track show us some of the pop off game but he had really made a name for himself when he was going to perform back onthe case while we are into Champions like with the bands coming through expected you mean car message wannee also dropped off the table so tsm's turn the first big hero around and here's what they see as well as a rock in here are very likely will be going pot or has been looking to see if if it were taken away but I think with both those off there's not really much point because you're going to have one or the other yeah it seems that people are really prioritizing more now going away from the character in Fort Worth that Tom kench I don't think it's going to get locked in this early on a specially when you are taking into consideration the fact that Tom kench is likely paired up with Sona which denies lot of work you know what to do or of course I want to see what sort of texture at the bank account looks like Isaiah the entire draft now toplay around with a soda comp is going to look like typically they really turn on the mid game around two to three items you can sustain through all the poking at the Box immediately going Telemark been trying to go high DPS baby pushing through ceiling. Would come out and I hope you had a giant working to do the heavy lifting picking a rate in this position to draft traditional you'd be worried okay what if they don't you know you're going to be able to grab that work on as your neck fix so Porky certainly securing their carries early on but Tom kench Quest yeah he's a tremendous amount of global pressure oven times tables what kind of trade different sat there and looked a mess with any Global fresh and gold pressure brought out by their opponent but is this case guess I'm Canal look to drafting a strong top-line for example and hardly heavily towards that and it could be tough racket box build a match because it's locked and I think this would have draft State favors the team in the red side cuz they get first dibs on the timer and counter pick on topand blue can't do anything about that here we know it's not a Comcast Spotlight we know it's 90% EF mid do we have seen that move around in some cases but of course you do have the fact that you're certain got a cup full match up to the stop light for Keith that this is okay I'm comfortable comfortable but I am looking incremental leaves on the last half of this raft Lane matchups go that should be the edge the question then just becomes mechanical fox actually plays that out or get enough of the lane Advantage because the early can has certainly not been their strength and you know when you get to the midden late game TF2 taunt control thing everywhere things can get very hectic it's not necessarily going to pick 4 in the counter picks we might see Laura Lowe bring us what it is if he wants to play here is one final been coming through a kind of whittling down the jungle pulled and pick him up from theredoes really feel like they're setting up for us before Style game who do you draft a very strong top-liner something that perhaps you are a new could be struggling in a could be a good matchup into to set up for something along the lines of a 45 a composite want to drive from Port of a tank but it is pretty interesting that you are a very strong later these days especially people have been going grass fence or 3 and just utilizing you stand essentially it's going to get you through the early Lenny faces scale towards a later stage of the game where we know if you're is so strong but excited to see broken play to bring out something along the lines and play some of the more difficult matchup do you have all these can be so I could come to that side lane assist you and broke a blade blade at once already that flipped around probably but I mean at least would bewe have kind of seen it proven that when Sona is being drafted you want to go early and punish it usually when people try to display possibly it doesn't really work out for them so at least alongside rakan and xayah that is going to be a very aggressive set of Champions you have to engage you have the potential to do look at play Greta Lee and dive as well that's the one I like it since I was here when the clutch is still very strong in the jungle very cool. So as far as what third straight game today that I have seen them and yes it did get your that that can a buck with Grievous wounds attachment to this the second part of your cue, but I do think it was fairly strong before that in and just that the worst player taxi try it out and are having success with it especially Instagrams it's such a powerful Champion one plate aggressively that I can have a lot of success but I don't think people have been utilizing led to itsthis is not a farm without play even style scampi this is a get aggressive all sound cool down looked at her a dive to reset the thread a girl with with the dismounted be sort of place if you're not going to do that you're not going to bother us we'll see if he can play custody against is Papi's o Laurel brings out of toppling tank and if we are the champions they got some bus in dispatch if you can trust you with her W you are grounded and float for two extra Second Chance flashed away can't either run away the wall slam could be coming solo is the second tank on the roster spots open in Gainesville open follow up Mike young hoping to find some early gamepress Amanda has won Total assist across this summer split tree in the ALCS pre 15 minutes really really like the echo Fox draft you know if I was going to turning off the name places looking at a distant early for the draft style of life I think I slept very well as in coffeefight well into Clyde it's very easy to actually do interrupt the cloud with your W on Poppy and before that many suns there and this is something we're likely we're going to see a DTF you can stack Parmer fairly heavily the Sona is as well as you know this is jungle Silas probably are not going to be enough of a threat to force Mr coming out of the poppy so I would be interested to see where Laura Lowe does go but if you can kind of sustain yourself not fall too far behind the cloud your wedding is going to be very powerful and then I do think that they have the tools to actually engage in and look for a fight against things like the TF and the Sona when you have this work on when you have your least you have these way to get in and it really strong back line of his eye on the court date we are ready for the Oscars get back underway is TSM faces Echo Foxthere's got to stop demasi Twisted Fate fans better to do teams on as well anime tattletales matchups do indeed flight out and what kind of early Russian we can get out of the Jungle and I will be very very interesting certainly know if you get it I had enough on 8 matchups but he can be really tough to actually snowball a game onto because it doesn't have like enough true damage no kind of in the kit a long line so if you are something just like a hundred year was Hank under a trailer that can be very very difficult so I will see how much they want to commit to that side land because it does look like she also has has drafted this composition who actually no go top and looked do that but still like bring the slide to where the TF is and utilize clad ultimate for gauges and he sort of place but yes I'm certainly doesn't want to just fight front back by B5 they want to be more creative they want to get old man fight utilizing Comcast utilizing TF and also that cut altimate to to isolate members in and really pick them off and this is going to be I think a really fun game to watch because it is fairly Technical and how you have to play it out right it's so much. the execution I think you're 40 SM can they pull off the Sala play I think about the rest filled with on this roster for TSM side you got to Katie and here is stealing maybe not Zima Papio and knocking then abort taken away can be really exciting but otherwise I think it's the quickest is a reasonable engagement but kind of curious to see what it looks like he's mine 914 has sign those pages as well during the ultimate much longer cool down otherwise higher damage the Champions. Go up those earn some money trade blows with Sven Scooby train back and forth there and we'll see how aggressively and Alexis Pauline wants to play into this know so much of when you are playing work on it is Tom kendzia can you actually catch tahm kench as well as the carry in your engaging in 10 do that I didn't deny that is our that becomes very very powerful but you know that is also somewhat dependent on smooth Ian Spence backing up in front of making decision errors on their own if you can't see that it's fairly easy to actually stop what aqua wants to do here with for the symbols of our my friend on the top side pretty good damage work with playing at aggressively Laurel oh it's you that they should be in the first race and I love to see that that is exactly what you want to be seeing from a clutch player that this was Champion where you really want to get in their face utilize the early levels and in the power that you have with our email note to try to trade aggressively and then looked actually hold your W skill point you you hold on to that you don't actually level it up until you do Dismount and then you can actually use the violent tendencies to remount but Broken Blade has decided to it to level it up you can utilize that for for early trading but I do really think it can be quite powerful hold onto for almost guarantee against Atlanta temp right here is Preakness playing a bit aggressive way now and I can't going to show up as well but of course the jungle Ursula topper everything going as well rental cars Mike young people listen to she just popped off really stepping up in this early game to flash his well-being was there this initial engage here from Echo Fox and I'm coming across on the Pearson the gold card is up by Mike Yung flash hit the Cocoon and once they actually live that so much damage was down you can no longer take this fight to Acadian really should not be off to use this but he goes into the one be to take so much damage flashes out the easy repel over the wall here for Mike young and in the phosphorus bomb another cocoon does Lan and they're able to make it at 240 in the middling you'd pick up there I can fax them off to a thousand gold lead off those killed hopefully get some of those further early game at least finally comes through waiting so many weeks for this kind of really came out of my youngin might be too little too late we can hope it's not as the top link bush is coming in small see asleep for Laura Lowe holding on just fine also worth noting double bus on Phoenix says they're going to engage on the bus side and damaged then we'll be able to survive of course but you didn't have to actually use his Tepee d'Alene he has three cups and bowls in charge of his know a biscuit double bus like that is a very hard laying out of play into the Sharon Hill right now the bottle is being pushed around is Apollo's down to very low man if he also has a freeze you can see and I hope your son is Flash lift and has to play somewhat afraid of what might be coming as a control board in the middle brushed just below Phoenix so it's a safe route for this Elise to take there's there's no vision heading into that brush with Mike young sleeps down to their bjorksten can't know for cfma do at least I know a couple words kind of guarding the top side of the Scuttle if it's worth as well here so they can have these pockets as Vision in that area you can try to play a bit more towards at top of the map board should cover any sort of Route coming past those wrappers as well so you at least know it's more likely that make him would come from the bottom side butt and even though that is true Mustang has bypassed Ellsworth bypass Kelly's bottom side right now yeah it's probably going to go for maybe you go so you can break right now when she responds but this right here and it'll be claiming the Drake get back in Atlanta follow simply walk back and Acadian skin wars but there is no flash deal division but not going to lose his life for this and they got their base off reset walk back to that dragon with items and you know easily are able to just knock down that Dragon so there's going to greet their leaning that much more you know how the ocean Dragon for all the additional regen you can trade more heavily this is extremely frustrating as well for Broken Blade when you're into a tank match up as a carry their able to get the ocean even if you poke him down are we going to be vulnerable then to just kind of getting wheels down and do it beautiful stuff right now but the game hasn't she shrunk get a little bit you only a $500 difference do courtesy or so I process a closer look at this. I'm not sure if it's odd I don't think it did I think he was just below it it looks like there's nothing to me or either so and he is going to be able to start up this Red Bluff he drops a pink on it as well that's a nice little lukowich for you to stop you do and could scrap utilize it later on before a little engages out of a charge it up with for a hex last time we'll see if he's going to be able to actually pull that sort of stuff off later other juice bottle now exiting the jungle so you can see Acadian was at the very least including that he would be down the boss sign is now matching that Redbox take away and more damage now I'll talk while and then trade some
get the Champion's quest for in dates on the outside of playoffs but they can still make the third golden Guardians just recently lost one of these as well they're tough competition are falling down as well as CLG sitting pretty company in Fort Worth right now have their working room in and see if they can pick up all the way in here yeah be interesting to see a sealed you tries any funny business in this rap phase of the last time they played we actually got ruined play Midland Renekton a while. Wayne on Victor and they were able to win that game but that also was a irelia counter Pick and Pull Belton the plane that since they remove doubt or the chance of Ripon shows up for flyquest the counter pick for the Top Lane schedule the show early for ruin hereFort Bend Indiana Karma still available right now we'll see if that's the last final Banda Carmen he's got his Antics in a van right across probe Play Dispatch and it will be ribbon away so, I expect to see very early payoff in a graph big-time respect bands coming up from you guys with a lot of Thai present stuff not getting bad early on, would be the most likely to be pick since you can't what's around for play it Support also want to point out a weird Quirk about Pro play in terms of inertia so back in Hatch 911, would that about when red and 10% progress in Banff in may be the champion of Love admittedly got over by the it was a 10% increase on to a 10 Mana reduction on E and the big line was the one second at adoration on the E moviesBilly, goes up to 100% win rate went up 4% right up to 54 in Solo to the moon and back to 50 however because the proteins have thought about where, should fit in draft kind of realize that she is so good in either a sold in or support know she's flexible she's just like stuck in pronoun or 90% because she still good and had been for a while and by the way, can we stop playing this game as we have xayah and rakan already locked in here for my quest for the Wildwood of a deep convo very high price Spotlight to go to be up against it as well as the game ends up trying to put against it you may or may not be able to know where karma is going to finish on the final two pics frommyquest but a lot of stuff still open to painting a house making these guys want to go cuz you're Corky Keanu is something that P o e has been putting a lot of games into until a few still never know they're still not sure where that cam is going to be a top laner Sylvia's hair band come through my bet is just kind of guessing it toppling just just I feel like I see so many socara Suites about how to make caramel the best Champions Billiards colors my opinion forever fastest car that works for me paint Karma one-trick Baisley great player formerly known as kale box and it's time for the score of the Moon and she's going to be off the table you for this one as well as mentally stronger in this past and we getting a lot of advice before it's 680 the next one player time is second phase of bands just kind of go to nonessential can't use that is not the case with one of you is super highidentical hair very similar to be fair oh well quick Taco it's okay at 6 a.m. to read coaching here for video Six-Day War recover breathtaking is always as a couple to his fans come through but you never know yes if you don't really know what the, kind of pic would be most the time to just trying to help Scale app for sale games are going to decided in the early-mid game could potentially do it if I ever want to get into each other and Fries we see a lot less rise though because now you have to actually land a spell fluffy in order for your W-2 fruit with rest of Robeson LPL a couple of times low presents bit later but cool to see him out once in a while about finding a 9.14 as well and Corky to be logged in as be very highly prized bit later after the azir band and now it's like West to of course we're going to have their Top Lane be Karma after all d2 jungler pantoran Andres has been by far his most played Champions even though other countries are prioritizing Jarvis was wanting more of the fact that you won't even come through doesn't bother Sandstorm when you mentioned it is 5 by picked so far to split with 3 win 75% of 13 points Casio or rise up there in the top. Don't listen to watch for yeah I love watching pee on his slightly less present middle of his kind of throwback pics to me those are the Victor and the Oriana picture was banned didn't feel like Oriana with the right thing to play against Corky still unknown coming into the same how is vipers Top Lane, going to look how is Cassiopeia start taking Gage to hear ruins ride keep mine there's now a third rank of Realm Warf aquatic it's pretty short in the rain does not too bad so you can see some pretty big moves out of that champion and meanwhile is going to be the work on it would be leading charge of the black west side and wild turtle being a very large hairy black Westside to big back landmarks been there has been better as of late stepped up quite a bit here while Turtle has been completely stellar and I will see if I can push pain for its Blackness are a game-and-a-half out of playoff position right now with the wind there only one game behind with five games to play and they can't make their way in but it will be a very late surge CLG alone and forth right now after they couldn't keep their their lot of looking good but it seems possible they are poised to break 7-Eleven and make it back in the playoffs and looking for once again to come back and cash we 7 because I immediately get to say stuff like this is a must-win game which it is I think I think it's a must-win for flagrant if they go to 492 they probably don't make the playoffs and even though it's not a must-win for CLG it would do a lot to kind of curb the stress of their fans and probably biofrost by the way has been the guy who's been around for all these joints stop making class and a high level of success is on right it has been some rebuilding 4 cyl Jeep and I would need is actually surrounded but they don't know that if you re calling but now I can try to do is fine with W for 2 seconds things to buy a nice to score the right to call puts on those fans be moved anyway like just take the damn to Presby I was in a bad spot and you only got some selfies go to the useless with decent time to book the Civic you would never kill him which made him recall few seconds later so in the right place. Damage but he's actually know later to the leash in later to Lane as a result have you heard of mental Warfare free yeah I totally agree to it would have been better for you later. Bye Woody otherwise I feel like there that's the kind of walk around there we go. Is that right every skill shot. It's the way she has for wild turtle add another email to Megan we're good here yeah I quietly as well not a lot of quiet stuff like what she's been doing when we talked about wildturtle have the lowest at some bleach per game would he also has the best KD 8 in the league but you don't necessarily get those things just by being super super awesome as we see some trading happened in midlane would deed has a 13% Ford percentage that me to 13% of the waning phase above half way up in the link to 50% always pushing their current which will make it a little bit more limiting about what's my question do with the rest of the map as luck would have a look at where they are there under the zero deaths maybe not going to be more minions and there's a temporary CS bleed here for the CLG Cipher Auto there you go off and I feel fairly comfortable farmside should be all right here and we look around the rest of the map we had a temporary leave for pull out there pushing the first two waves I managed to get hundreds of Cs whereas we feel we lost four fan Toronto Raptors are gone away not going to fight this deal they are but also means a big loser full Camp ahead and is this going to be going to be answered by the telegraph going down to Saint torrent all the way to Scuttle crab it's going to be a full clear for santorin not so much 1/4 Wiggly depending on how passive this game ends up being that could be really beneficial for santorin watch how quickly does I feel like he's mainly just guarding against a possible Rex I think before we call if you're walking to try brush what's the recall down okay now you don't know for sure if he's waiting for our dive this or they can just always feel safe but it's always a chance you like more time it's always a smart to getting some rest before you recall just in case cuz you never know they could both be going for crossing the topside weekly would teach and turn on that Ward if you decide to go to something for him Flash recalling in fog of War near up play that could have been had rooms going to find a big roof ice dam Shield NW runs back out phase rush to the rise and what usually typed on a Viper in Atlantic you this much damage there yeah I'm going to end up paying decent man attention to Central Fish and Cheez-Its game but it will depend on whether or not someone actually gave to stop playing with the gang Karma Again part of the reason she was kind of turn back on the map back as he can't come back up get the chickens going back onto the project spend every highly efficient Farm path so far actually became for two heads w need to look like all of it all away gang someone was killing Crux and was Antoine let's talk about a year ago and Santorum was trying to get recognition for a coming back as a strong jungle one thing you did more than if you were always kill frogs and it's because santorin did the research and saw that crooks are worth double the experience of any other Camp so if you do nothing but clear cruggs compared to other camps much faster than anyone else so even though it's a difficult place to get on the map is there more than one else to watch the break the route gets back of the wrong warp stays alive the very long cool down but does not that game yeah so that will make the return gank if they have a number to damage so very good. Because he made actually died there if you got to drop off interrupted but ends up pretty flash will use that pressure created trying to trace topside so with no vision at all it's going to need to pick up there so you'll be pushing up with a side of the map they have not recall getting sick but he's still got top in Lake Zurich. He's going to recall by an item in the TV back in the lane by the Wonders absolutely that is the best drink to get early especially on stuff like Cassiopeia and different the Champions dead in order to get the wave priority have to kind of deplete their monitor with Essence Reaver first you often see on paper that hears you see on Cassiopeia lowers the blue box dependency on the mid lane really actually high-cost flash burn if you think about them burn the flash of rise in order to give up the ocean drink so I think he'll give me very happy about her for, to be the hard carry that you left a ribbon could be 120 people the back line but traffic is currently exert her will on a game that will keep tracking that over the course of time when it's acting as T are vipers getting some extra ability power early on for wave clear and eventual item completion technical lead for flyquest do it from farming you can see Farm leads in pretty much every single analyst small degrees here in the game going pretty low action but we'll see the warrior XII come in and probably try and make something happen at level six will be interesting to see how my quest functions with Viper on Carmen right rather than on Riven or Cannon her belly or something they can dive in and go and make that big play
even look at some of the stats that don't necessarily shop in wins but as far as getting stuff done early kills busted in 15 minutes behind the engine has been playing very well enabling broken plate to leave the league as in toppling killed with 37 and thinks you're going great but are definitely trending upwards to the end of 27 and 5 maybe not be highest record of being TSM house before but certainly a strong team attention Golden Garden Andover they can turn from what recent slide around but again I Dimensions to into with this generation of the roster and I think treading water with generally both pretty well for the squad to fix games to play and then get a couple more bands coming through as 3 support bands of human I guess I'd really say to soda for 6 weeks a spot Lane farming champion andI want to take a moment to talk about Jonah in the LCS in particular because I know a lot of LPS fans are very pacini's in seeing this champion in games however the ALCS in particular prioritizes stonith 60% and elec 32% in the lck and 22% in the LCL and dispatch him particular since I actually works Dona has dropped from a present to 54% to 18 yet it does seem like any teams are still very willing to ban Sona I'm not staying that is wrong I think that is a regional difference because they put more time into picking anyone else so they were going to be more hesitant to drop it even after receiving herplay in what is an NA Academy that be one of the first place that brought it out I think PSN Academy that sells what are the first four runners there and take them bands in the back to take Sports down here stylus for contract must do what the Damage Done To The Jungle roll and hit by a kid instead you wanting and an early as real here for his vent yeah it's been pretty much the only thing you seem like you ever played back in 2018 put a lot in Spring as well this will be his third as real game of this foot and because they have this is 1 a even though the incredibly strong Suwanee irelia Joe is gone it is still a strong pick I'm going to go ahead and grab a winner here for before it's all over and I got to fly into space rocks are the top spies do their Blain's Farm probably 80 karrie heerfordt FBI as well as their mid laner for frog in is going to be with picked up laps right here earlier if you don't mind those wordsplay down to the bottom right away the most difficult. I'm looking forward to see what contracts can do on this island Divani at level Tik Tok Tok reasonable at your ruling in the ER the game not the best ultimates Bastille so far on the table at some point as well sit still very very high priority in abortion work on not going to play since you ready to the prom there's not a huge reason to care about Society either you don't typically solar a collie actually does make sense for me to consider Broken Blade in Jacksonville with very good at taking the game in their own hands and rid of a lot of flexibility this realization that and let me see if Kiana which team in baseballagain for Capriccio which are deer in particular the most picked mid laner this split in the LCS if it is so heavily fit down a little bit surprised it's not bad more for 9 want to try and acted when she rains but knowing Bjergsen and frog and style thinking he would be a pretty good choice as there would be a good choice but it's not really blind fix here for the Frog inside play spaghetti crop top for FBI's we know what the bronchitis and I'll go to go to the play at hear themselves up against Tom Kent as real pretty free lights for guys to get a lot of gold I don't really see if you can pull it out by that but I thought that you kill off his face and something from you two goals that should be pretty safe here Keanu is the Battle of Champions Copley similar reasonsand now what you play up there you know you're right yeah I think you actually send me as your top into aatrox or that I can get the Camille Camille midst and work is when we did see a little bit but yeah it's probably as you're making it all right to see the day where frog and Flexes in the support and who he takes mid because who he has been an amazing run has several support wins NLCS already here. With a few times did it happen is Play 3 CT up top as well by the way so you never know for sure but probably been here for frogging yeah and I very much expect her to be playing by a truck going up against the me-too effect that lane because we met you before even know how much has been so strong in the waning phase a what's 17 CST is 15 by he has the lowest I'm just going to leave because off in time contract trying to make stuff happen Elsewhere on the map and it draws a plane and let's have to go to work and against the Camille excuse to want to get involved in the attack of the Suwannee Stone in 1.5 seconds and kill you that's when it becomes far is still good, louder on yet another Silas dance at a very good one previously puts out a lot of damage do you are and light on tanked it's wrong to support roles you're only obvious Freightliner that can make things a little bit difficult sometimes break him down a lot of backlash metaphor still available in 1 C of hard engaged for TSM camills hardly think that's the one he can as well it depends Puritan on his beer this could be very spicy position go to go to the game behind also in 5th 6th and guardian has here so we got to see that again but we also get to see what could be a season 2 finding moment for Golden Guardian what is the difference in our perception of you seemed really think of Guardians it's like Guardians would have clawed out a win that game they would actually have a better record than CSM and then looking forward golden Guardians remaining schedule is the hardest in the LCS so you could consider this a must-win and it's a team they have beaten in the spring and been very close to beating so far in the summer Hot Spot look for a ward in the tribe rush but you cannot put one down I'm assuming up some level of research and expecting where tsm's Ward's likely are that's around on happening if the youth employment for standing out in the corners at looking for long-range vision and they won't get caught by end of this year quiz fake gold cards into Brown Flats to you you can often kill someone out right away. They are not spotted not killed and it's going to be just a yeah I think if they weren't against a Tom Camp Suwannee golden Guardians would have actually invaded harder Brom usually just Windsor Lee invade Israel would be the best which they don't have here they have the bronchi so but it does Busch contract to a fox I'd start yet it is fairly known for Golden Guardians of the Cajun stop starting to cycle especially with that all the time. A lot of times in Pro the jewel names just going to start in the rain for security and takes up half actually Dodge's store on board the put-downs nevermind he does his own Ward after Camp so that's that's big bring it there by Katy and that's that's the bottom panel of the Galaxy brain, Kyle he's going for some really cheeky I think he's expecting contracts to go I guess after can eat but it's actually not a great level to Champ because you need the W2 come through he's literally just has CUNY but with the melee he'd be able to get Stones I'm a little surprised he's making that move maybe he expected contracts to do a different path yeah ends up to coming back to take his bill he was about 15 to 20 seconds. To be lost the first Krug that's the timer there and they kind of go to match back in and go to the Jungle camps once again but yeah that minion right as the game is coming around he did Dodge all the boards sadly Hunters playing so far back that he was not getting Columbus Origins and there's going to be picked up there but yeah that could have been the possible crazy first letter U show read from the top side but I'm going to have an earlier clear for sure here at 4 cicadas open the pickle buckets out of the map with kind of unlucky there get the Talisman and he's taking blue and Grump and read all of which kind of rather have hunted machete for absolutely you would I thinking about how this bottom line is going to play out I'm curious to see how much attention Acadian will eventually pay to it but they're also up against like I said who you don't normally want to give easy laying face too especially and he was in for the kill but doesn't go for it there instead of what smoothie walk back into into the back lines that reason to have a potion so it definitely looks like we can do in the summer but if you are very rude I know you'll only find the first 4 minutes playing two completely different sides of the map Hunter we able to get a lot of help out does burning flesh but the successful dive and kill for contracts is Silas also taking into account how Acadian didn't have an efficient XP clear contract hits 644 Suwanee see how clean this guy was right here watch how they kind of balance the turntable because whenever you see the guy who gets first blood not have to immediately flash out it means they've done something right so who he grabs turn a growth landvik you say we did we get this done knows how many hits you can take and then since the kills already happened no one retake Ezra so it's literally just three hits on who he that's about as Queen of a thank you stamp it on the team at that point in time is no problem just to be safe Hebron summer heels just in case you needed it didn't fit it was just too if you helped make sure nothing went wrong and it was pretty beautiful right there so golden Guardians off to a great lead and everything I've seen from this Duo has been can they play aggressive in Kennett workout to get punished they've been thinking I have one One Direction that go in his Ford sometimes they're coming a horrible sometimes they do and they pop off and it seems to be louder hey go for play sand in the past that had been an issue for teens that have organized they say frog and does nothing but sitting playing I actually would say as well part of golden Guardians Resurgence is frogging is playing much more aggressive he's had a fairly dominant Lane phase about the second-best laning phase mid laner in the right so many times you should see frogging with a low forks and this year it's up at 27.7% which without contact me nothing but it's around like third highest in the league right thing. I'm pushing for a little bit more frog in front of some cards out so we had just going to keep on attacking them anyways back and forth equal CS properties players contracts I believe Dodgers Vision with the path you just took right there no pain from bruises very least and has anyways if we get back and forth any of those little bit low to grab this grab honey production needs it you just put the heart down in the jungle monsters thanks for the control board there is division there's the resources and violence to looking pretty soft the golden Guardians side aggros the dragon realized there was a ward in there but they can do it supposed to feel pretty safe and froggy had just recalled Midland party and just a formality and specifically with your chin was looking forward to the climate which will give frog in a lane pressure bandage they both recalled fog and teleported back gave him completely infertile Drake very powerful break in two minutes of it coming up and going to be the early but instead of resources there's a Golden Gardens happy they're already winning the bottom land they Hyrule Drake's this point every single stamping on their team aside from the Broncos really going to care about the bonus attack damage in the bonus a piece that's going to be nice you you kind of lucked into a lot of citizens here if only they could have picked Leona then they have the Guardians my vernacular is now very tea if he had me but I really meant in League of Legends sense I'll give you that one but he actually true that was on Reddit everything free okay
it was just one of the largest possible disappointments especially after all the height of after they got bang but as you mentioned once before also want to hear this point is there by 2 and 41 not in the last week of patch 9.13 + Pro play in North America still going to have a lot of enchanteur bands coming out you and me luck Carmel all could really important than I had a band that's exciting thing is actually very strong on patch 9:13 so if they saw were you practicing it in solo queue of the W mag cost is actually very low the Q was faster than it was in previous pageant that has been adjusted for 9:14 but actually understand the band there for Dan to see at least it's important band we know we're not going to play with me to pack is it but if it's not true for you look drop it off the tablede-carb and away so luck has been for mere as has been as ear and we'll see which one goes where but you can expect you this chance to come up pretty quickly and feed on first of all the other pics of wanting not only a strong Pick 4 spent Aaron since he's been around in the protein so long and it's a lot of his wanting only once you want to split but it's a big denial pick from amazing who's picked up two wins in four games on normal length of got to be a positive ones there goes with second most played in there making it his all time in the summer split the standard high priority met a champion at some point as well and they're going to get that whenever they wanted as long as they let you know that it for the band face but one that right away they are waiting to pick their just kind of picking the pipe resin Champion so farBiafra news First Watch Game of the split 100 thieves had been fairly reliant on just going for xayah rakan whenever possible since when 100 deep does find success at the office through a through making strong and gauges and part of how they bounce back is with strong Wayne faces between bang and a half of myself as a higher Gable play up to 20 pick you were expecting a railing to be one of the most of the time in pixel on side so that's why I'm being serious is going to be really for sure okay is there kind of pic I want and we'll probably to the Midland answer what I have two words 5 seconds ago Cloud I need another champion it could be support could be bothering to be Top Lane it's actually going to be obviously Charlie physical is completely set up to play the way they want to play it possible to move the irelia mid lane if they want to be able to kind of pick either one of those Lanes only works in Crevewell with melee laners particularly rally as you mention that's why they combo so well together and the whole top side of the map for C9 is so aggressive and still good early game I'm actually maybe even expecting them to try and bannout may be a corking his ear in the second phase to force more of a volatile matchup in the Middle Lane still that's been staring thing really can call Temple Shir also want to point out that some of the other pristine Midland pigs have been left off Kianna actually has escaped through the first six fans and pics pics of doing picking her up either true that has been a high pretty damp in there it is Young Lyric really would make composition sense in that regard we know it's ever watch the bottom light almost for certain I'm not expecting Lex to go in for you and there's easier band that is working as your profilewhat type of Solon if you get to pick later but I want to kind of call attention to the Lux and discover because even those are very powerful team fighting Champions they are not necessarily known for getting sandwiches in the early laning phase and looking through 100 ft stats real and fake God are mostly just there to stick around until the team fights days with some of the worst gold stats at 15 in the entire lcso hundred thieves will need to play A Little Bit Stronger in both the top and mid lane position since that's not normally where they can get their advantages so so far just based on the Tennessee two teams are really like tonight for something to get blind if he is still flexible freshness Kiev places Champion once this split works pretty well in either Lanes what is it in mind and I would be surprised even pick 3 is Champion a tank top when it's almost more sacrifice the bolts and bakeI want to kind of take the L for the team and survives the best he can in bad situations up against these arguably best top laner and Licorice and he quasi blind VA truck yeah and I'm just going to say that a truck to go on top and that's what she not to be driving around now Canon would not be too surprising to throw up toppling against the atrox add some things to go to the Rockets win for sure they kind of a definitely makes sense as you can or magic damage the roster which can be nice to see and it will certainly be laying down in it for licorice and and now we know they really is going to go mid for Nifty here Braum's going to round out the bottom Lane I like him a lot into server you block the boomerang blade you block for chicken going any further pretty good at not dying and even then like what is not crazier they will push but they will not probably kill a bronchitis and now it's about what were you pick in the mid lane guessing that he's going up against really it's very rare that you would see Ken and so far he's mainly played those control me to drive to record games and is your game to Victor game not all things are available what is available though lissandra lissandra comes around and it seemed that way back in the day as well but I'm pretty sure this is a line up Sophia this will help know if I somewhat think it is amazing to me is is this team's having very diametrically opposed shrink benign have a bastardly strong numbers Top Gun gold mid-thigh for the getting out of it there benefits and their body weight has been doing very poorly in early Landing yeah I'm very much expecting C9 to try and run over the top and mid side the map the bottom Lane is the very interesting part and why it is I think a little is a stylistic mismatch between the two teams because we're not necessarily win through the bottom line they've gone equal or slightly ahead for the bottom line and then they went through the middle so it's really about whether or not 9:10 roll the early part of this game and how well the Northeast to hold onto maybe then try and force mid length in fights with lysandra mentioned earlier in the day are undefeated with leaves at 15 it's just the sample size of 2 of 2 it leaves at 15 but what happens what happens it's been very successful so last remarks from the coaches I believe we are dodging briefly and is not loading just yet I did not see what happened but someone opted out I'll hear what that is exactly in a in a little bit and we'll will pass it on to you, but we're making chapstick little bit I guess me some time to talk about lesandro because if you do cast your mind back to early on the season will solder was basically picture banned in every game and in my little you know 7 months vacation to the ballast E minor. What you did your boy learned the first one was an attempt to Nerf her waveclear by increasing hermana cost so the Kumon cost went up and basically what that did it shifted lissandra build some watch Wars luden's Echo instead of protobelt however this is the tricky thing about Mana cost is pro players are incredibly good at managing their mother if they really wanted to do they still could get jobs when he needs you to hold on Vermont of the first did they get the shop to go to Scuttle crab fight they win they have all the early CC affects the endless on whatever get what ended up actually nerfing Cassandra out of Base to 100% territory was just hard restrictions on the Q cooldown still 10-second cool down a rank one for second cool down at Max rank which is up on both accounts and it basically makes impossible for the Sandra Crouch of incredibly early and then later her way clear still reduce know she still has basically the same strong engaged and still very strong team fighting if you can get that point but the early game is much weaker so previously the Saundra was picked because irelia is still mobile basandra could shove a rally in Lysander could see see irelia in team fights and you'd win that way but in this matchup now with the current lysandra expect Misty to have a little bit more Freedom Early exactly what she and I wants ya but if 100 use can get to the late game demo sonder will still be good at keeping irelia a little mustache Valentino's the champions of this is probably even farther ago at this point that the devil and reduce magic damage either so if you locked in a really are you are all magic damage or taint that does not have really good innate magic damage durability I actually drove into base that's a bunch before irelia has high armor and low health for a champion of her class so she's actually a typically weak to Magic damage on a base that level as well to smaller margins in like you're cool then changes were but this is actually poised to be in Peabody scenarios do buffalos on intentional to preference irelia a little bit towards Top Lane even though she has so many other attributes that make her strong midlane like the E being incredibly long-range to get engages we're going way down to your belly rabbit hole with hopefully we haven't lost some of the audience but it was just kind of fun to talk about irelia lissandra matchup we will be loading into the game shortly and I guess it does give us a time this interesting facts it in this game fanfic Euler to go to get a lot more time to do than talk to other players about one of the PCL 10 champions how do you want to approach the game this is this is kind of a rarity I suppose but the extended from the coaches on stage really true and I wonder what they'd necessarily we talkin about now because normally you as you mention can I have 20 seconds to say oh yeah by the way watch out for the driving game top or watch out for says Yankee top at 3:20 because you've done a lot of scouting and trying to pick out players early-game tendencies in this I wonder if you just remind people like hey by the way sneaky you're probably going to get ganked a lot because that happened every game text looking to the Jungle proximity difference which is the percentage of time you're younger fans near you vs. when the enemy jungler spending are you sneaking Azazel or have some of the most negative JP differentials in the entire game they are basically left alone while Spence Karen goes around and thanks for nisky for most of the game and then licorice actually ends up not getting ganked that much because the enemy truck is making sticky play weak side of the map but as we've seen from Spencer Terence a SanDisk East Side Liquor to Steph was a pressure top side is working as much as it is to be you know to V4 in the bottling for the C9 Duo the 3-v to Top Lane goes really well also and of course he not alone and stuck in this is clearly a strategy that has working for them even it does make sneaky and they look a little bit bad on the other side of the map of course hundred thieves it's really kind of diving into had a few stats cuz in my mind I always just like ignore the first four games cuz that was before they put the roof it got switch in the meeting were still in those games by playing a lot of an order play with a hundred things are as an aura kind of the same but to me like I'm mentally going to start them in week 3 what does 04 deficit hey that's already got to make that a lot better but from that point on if they've been a bit more promising of an amazing first game of the stage he landed earlier in the morning out of Germany and it had to play on stage and he would sleep deprived in his game play yeah and speaking of amazing I do feel like the pic they have been gravitating towards have been fairly successful is the coaches we're going to be able to have the authority Jarvan to Kewanee tank control junges for amazing that the type of stuff he was playing when he had his Resurgence over in I think was the EU LCS the time now LEC right if I'm getting my timeline drive for amazing but it is a type of game he's comfortable with as long as I don't get 400hp player only an LEC coach EU LCS player which is a rarity but we are now on this game between Cloud9 and hundred bees out of there if we are and let's see what we can do see 9 and 2nd hundred you just a game out of playoffs with only six games left to play with ground to make up a tough opponent for them today yeah can't wait to see where the attention is spent early on in this game how well can fake God hold up against licorice I know before we got the roster submissions we were wondering whether or not they God was going to be going up against Cuomo and what you have the battle of the rookies in right how is it going to work because T9 place so well around can you actually take down fake God now we have to see how Rusty licorice is going to be because he really did take time off to rest you play one Academy game to make sure he was not Rusty play they dropped one with C9 Academy Now look up against any trucks in Raleigh thanks guys probably super tough opponent in Cloud 9 today what was the main focus for this week's preparation and how confident is the team come into the match this week a big part was like kind of groin or Champion pools I think a C9 is a tough opponent specifically because they have really big pools so that was kind of a big message that we're trying to push across this week so we're playing a couple of new Champions this weekend so I'm kind of sad about that Mike was on her maybe affect you guys Christian and even one of the other ones as well and we never get to see it cuz Cloud9 scumbags Bandit away even though it's not necessarily new DLC First Time pics
hey that's in a Content team is going to be 6 ply steer that that's how I feel these going right now is one of these actually not that far for making that are going to happen I think they can make the climb near Reading when do you know it's not at the top six of a stacked up this Monumental lead it's very very close between your six and even laughed so under these certainly have an opportunity to continue climbing up in the stand strong together three straight win but last weekend up against give them and liquid very tough opponents they did lose both of those and the question is now cuz they're playing atoms atoms only was the Three Twins it is not too. We are done fixing bands already and you can see support bands I have been coming out as well Karma's but want to know big surprise here either or give me the first regulation match on 913 for bothexcited to see if they ever have new stuff cooked up we saw darmon sport relief for example and got so it's pretty exciting we definitely have to go by Passenger bonding in various things like that kind of making their way into the LCS but we're not expecting more of a continuation of the time standard play that we have been studying but banging aphromoo have been playing a lot more aggressively and I think they've been playing better and that is somewhat of the Catalyst to there were due to that big deal I think there has been getting a lot better to split as well he was a very big pick up and he came in his first lieutenant he was an MVP got I think it was third place with his one back then go to solid run and now looking I always loved it dhokla hovers Wukong for Allure on every time he is still up to match the scaletalk to do kind of prefer the has your side of this feeling that you're going to be able to have the bush in the midline if you have to poke out for me to make it a kind of tough for the Corgi in the early stages of course I barely even matchup in a very still dependent but we will see if we was going to kind of handshake on that stealing match-up is a Corky player and kind of always has been so I wouldn't be shocked to see that but there are always some of the other answers you know trying to go a little bit more aggressive trying to go for a roaming thousand and trying to put the game at a pace that is your has told me you're so charmingly picked up and he's definitely can be a high-tempo jungler we saw actually how well do your the game went just the previous one man Cloud 9 starving got several GameStop in the early games to work quite able to convert time to be going to grab more hard engage more Frontline is Nautilus grabbed up nowbaby getting paired with the diet I have seen that combo quite a lot and we haven't gone and out my mistake though see where they're going to go I can be a good aggressive option as well if you want to go that part of a route on the respect and of Draven is already been thrown the way they are also know maybe then I'll do that lane power from Las Vegas and try to go for it yourself of that pic as well as it takes away takes most played five Nautilus games for two of you may step listen to have AZ refocus Pani Puri always be different and has the for troll that can certainly matter as well it looks like he's actually care that much about Silas to delete this game playing decent bit of Darkness will put him as the most played in your title loans 561 e a r x I hear for meteos a bit more of an aggressive look at that cut his first play this split he has been to a morondo t&n for me I think you're very very well with that in a video certainly has been one of the standout players for optic I doubt it him and brown have been in a really caring a lot of of kind of load your for the squad and and the Restless players are certainly Plainwell around them but they have been I think what a lot of their games have been coming down here they're in the match of no City counter pick their front of these is just ridiculous stealing Champion themselves also jungle has grabbed us Darvin first did Rex I'm at now and then it gets a bit more different did Yvonne medals won the one side a truck stop on the other hand out means you got decent rolls they're expecting some more support bands of hunters music please. Was intended or not you know sometimes the teens snow are just good load actually lock him in the neck that can count against them but if it was some sort of a client error than we will obviously be pitching stafflooking at probably not even if it was just being slow or what but we'll stop down and show you a chance again when it comes back up yeah yeah usually I don't believe will actually reset if it would just slow I think the actual just lose that band so I had to be some sort of a you know it's one of the teams will say that it's like lying for lock-in or things like that but either way it's to me we are restarting picks and bans will be the same up to that point and I do think that you know 400 East Side I was kind of expecting more Marksman. Albans and retargeting arrow you can look at that or the support perhaps another do you think they're trying to get some sort of an edge on the bottom side and if you want to find out if you want to play aggressive know there's kind of the two sides of the coin do do try to deny the support that stop your engage or do you try to take away some of the ladies like Ezra who might be able to play more seriously around ithuman keyboard error interface so we'll be just when we get back at us when the 10 players in the lobby so as long as we have all the spectators and referees if that's what we need will be okay we'll see you in that comes through but shouldn't be too long from now and yeah I am curious what can 3D Mansion marching band seems to be likely is he looking for I'll waste makeup Nautilus work pretty well you know getting ready for the safe ones especially I think you know letting yourself option two planets as real probably feel a little bit weak in that case as you know just get away from thing you ever do and nothing ever looks good there but we have to wait to see what the choices end up being and what the counter pick Top Lane is going to be there as well because once you see the mid laner you see that the jungler you know they charge for dhokla is for dopes line of descent and end whenever you want you can grab fake-outs counterpick Dad definitely a variety of Champions will see if he has anything new in store for that match up in particular I don't think Kenny was banned but I'm I'm having trouble with her or she ain't going that Glee that can be a fairly good match if you want to play the into the atrox play towards the early gameI'm look for that certain Advance their have gotten an update a little bit ago it was about 3 minutes that we were looking at for this delay before we will get back in about a minute ago so I get around to pay rent a minute I also heard that all the picks in Van up to that point remain valid so the first three bands first to fix preside all going to say the same as well meet us on your screen play I want to talk about cuz I have really enjoyed watching the split so far you keep mine in Spring he was spending time with with Darla connecting everything on the dice thing I was really sure who would have been the better pic I didn't think because all that convincing I think either one would be the case for him but I have been all about media so far this but I think he's been absolutely phenomenal for optic all split long there in playoff position and they're looking good in a lot of because of him I think he's even very very consistent and he's a player that has been extremely consistent throughout his entire career right you know you look at his all-time record in the ALCS it's a ridiculous when right he has been no certainly one of the best performing players for so many years in the league and I think sometimes because he's not always playing theflashy style he can be overlooked at times but certainly is a very effective player and what do you bring to the team I think through comms If you experience is extremely valuable as well just get worried that we are just kind of checking the clients use of this document that you additional issues going forward they did have a band that one flock in weren't able to do it so I'm making sure that there will not be any repeats of that issue I have a question for you now as we talked about media some more please wait for the game to start what was your favorite media Ozark because there is additional Cloud 9 blown out blonde hair medium roast there is the return with Phoenix one of the Dark Knight gameplay if what any anime were like a nice guy videos nice guy medium term for it like what what is this media is look now because I was beginning 12.7 KDA whatever it actually wasI'm in the dark video songs and now we're just like journeyman extremely good jungler forever nice guy media guess though I let us know on Twitter I'm not going to lie my D&D NPC Jeff and stuff like that I get up and go home but that's how it goes but once again they're out of this conversation all right we got the bands and pick them up through pretty quickly here as we do have a lobbies back up and actually looks different than normal as the bands are coming through a locked in that's a new look for me but we'll get that up on your screen as soon as we are ready to go on to that side and the coaches and players get ready to resume where they left off in the pics Advanced not sure why it looks that way that is strange but hopefully we will have no issues just waiting on those bands come through for both side and I'm sure we will be popping a chance like once we arrive back to where we were in the big bands though it is not full parody you know we have both been leaders locked in all we have a top laner as well as a jungler there for optic and no we are assuming jungle as well as support for hundred thieves so generally speaking we are looking for what kind of band started towards the pieces that you're going to have not yet tracked it right that is certainly what you were trying to do in a hundred thieves you have a lot of engage already with his Nautilus you for so I'll be excited to see if they are going to try to really emphasize that strength and look for it for very aggressive sort of draft where they can try to play a much more up-tempo game going to be 7 to see what they do if you want to go for here as we finally have the electric coming thru HRS just got locked in the wrecks I was going to follow pretty soon after and then we will get us all back up on your screen I feel stupid stuff into my monitor and and they're just showing off their faces I just I'd like it when the visual medium you know life is what I'm saying and it's just unlucky here but we are finally into the real face of the band I was truthful and talk about the tempo on this one is the band of they're having Hollister going to add some support bands that makes a lot of sense to take that time off the table someone who can certainly denial of that hard games already have quite a bit of it has like more, I do think that's another band that could make some sense if you want to talk us into for pool we're going to snatch it up quite well into now it's so easy to black shield and out of the cell from a very very telegraphed ability has a long travel time so they could consider for this final band Big Lots camping pool and a strong match up there are other good matchup but they're less common in competitive play you know we do see the other range mashup things like playing with you never really see you but even Jack's we have seen showcase that can be quite good are we happy few will bring up from the jail in Nebraska meals been like more top laners there are feeling like we want to play for the lane in that room is too powerful in that so Minnesota State Fair in the bottom Lance's tells me they're looking for a grow through the bot Lane almost looks like maybe you don't spend your time down the bottom line here is it you think that has the ability to to go towards something like a Morgana knows there are still others say planners one line to Caitlin even though we haven't needed that much that can be a powerful do and I think now it's though that would be something you could look toward a Veris Auto can be a pretty strong often but you can have that added layer of not having a dad was to make a difficult actually feel this Nautilus and I want to be first dibs Marston pick and they are going to look for not that just yet but then but that seems unlikely but a game plan for the match up against a trucks no problem but what to do with the entire office afterward and they really into instead of actually blind picking that spot later they really do want to get a strong match up into their opponents they're going to look actually pick 4 Lane in a saving that martians Pick 4 Lane for her for bank and there's a possibility that he brings out a champion or navy Champion or something like that but this does mean you give over Lucien right you know. It's kind of what my expect if it wasn't at your will be able to grab that away so he is kind of taking it generally strongly Champion that has a dock which can help do a voice and all us until until 4 so the question is then just like what is the pic that hundred thieves connect to grab your ass and be fairly strong does have a lot of Leaning Tower but Lucien thrashes is there really going to be too and I think that you are one big have got themselves pretty kind of bulletproof laying here where it feels like it's really hard to get it boots with two guns I'm going to make it a bit harder here and 60 seconds ago and it's been 6 or at least players play mid and bring them down here all kinds of weird stuff and partially self don't really think like a horse play the threat himself but it is certainly not bad but it's a lot worse than I expected honestly you know this is such a late game style of of composition of feels like 400 I thought the last pick was going to be more lean Focus trunk what kind of powerful and they can look through
but around 9 o soon and are a top competitor and at 73 right now I think would would like to get a play at 5 and make that final going to make that was one of the pants he's everyone's mind right now and if I'm 9 attempting to keep pace and certainly set back a little bit by the loss of licorice knows now, has been feeling him very very well I'm also interested if you're going to start to focus him a little bit more and I missed you had an interview after their first win last week where he kind of said something along the lines of Kumo yeah he's really good when he gets kind of busy play Jason both games last week will that be taken away or will you be targeted and see if if players and teams can actually exploit him a little bit so right now I can Fox not wanting to ban away the Jason probably not getting first back to your either with you me being on the table and a deed that is right there so few Mo can easily play it through Straight Jays game and blanket that into still up I will see if there's anything they want more important than thatesportlivescore would be very very strong certainly Azazel is fairly experience on the champion and Cloud Nine you know has been playing a lot of these kind of enchanteur stop. Lake Nona games to Italy in the equation as well you have taken so far let's watch coming back this origin of you you mean like Spotlight still or going to plan it looks can be played it be happy in a couple times across Pro played this year but you tend to expect in kind of plan for a being to four. Don't think she has any obscure counter picks for your life and people generally feel that there is a building a room setup the answer is most matchups for the Lost of Nevada is certainly something that they're going to have going for them you mean Lucian a setup that we have teeth do kids parties around the world but physically in any way we have to get them running this a couple times to Freight Effectiveness can be quite a strong bottom Lane do you have the speed ups for dilution to get really aggressive EV charging forward the colon can be set up well by the UB ultimate it's also in a routing number for the first time for both Lucian and you is going to be locked in now as well nisky I was very successful and there's been a lot of discussion about the mid lane meta how it's going very stale right now so much as you're so much Corky and people have been kind of boring Pros to be like all right find a break the meta well this is going to second week second of a gar pick there for Nicki and I do think that this can be a very effective champions in this sort of style if you're going to hand stick on a Farm Lane scale up with the AP utilize your passive Farm up because if you do get to those later stages if you do get to multiple items that have a ton of back on your pass if you can realistically you off some of these calories in just kill them from fully it got pretty of third you can do a lot of damage right there so now at the drive-in locked in there putting a couple of jungle Vans echo-fox also aiming for the top land range bands here as well for pretty obvious play mostly those kinds of Champions C9 will get first pick once these bands are done I still want to see if a Jays fan come through there is enough Matt Damon good luck support and Veigar mid that Jake is a bad pic and I really want that question answered if you supply the same shampoo * Android Xbox want to deal with that and then the question also is people even worried about that either they will have likely to come over Fair bed and kind of seemed to watch Champions they believed him to be the most frightening on a choc Tazewell Buckhannon argue Target stove not super worried about the days does far even though he did play it twice last week has been a very good top laner and and there are answers to the Jace so perhaps you know you are trying to bait a pic like that and and bring out a counter or bring out at wrong answer your things along the lines of York even happen if there if I could not just but has never really panned out in North America specifically when people have played it but I'm going to wait until the very end to lock in that Top Lane pick we know if we're starving text Lee can flex but I doubt that pretty highly Xbox YouTube Sewanee Inn Palos dropped off the table as real for sneaky for the Lux as real shipping Lane down there and it'll be exciting to be very safe back there in like they won't get poked nearly as hard by that has better Champion will be number 4 for the champion in a tall is a really drunken clam player and it feels pretty comfort blanket into most of matchups at the question then just becomes you is, willing to believe into it to Charter police or were they just kind of saving his Pick 4 last to protect him a little bit in the draft and make sure that he is not the one being counter picked out there coming out from my cancel this much more aggressive look from the jungle certainly all about the early game dentally speaking my question is is there enough gag assistant you're really kind of worth it to where is he going to actually be looking on the map I would immediately think you're trying to Target something like that big are who doesn't have a lot of Escape but that being said Corky has no gang you really have no gangs in any of your lane supposed to also we could just be being utilized to try to pull you around the drive and hope that your legs are able to push ensure and then looks kind of get it done it just means that way well so has pick chase after all of it I didn't see it coming with you me and lusion although I agenda is real luck quite safe but if maybe you find your way in the back side there by invading by attacking clabber by professional Lane through tracking this opposing dumler and enzymes you are able to just through the sheer power of His in early game you'll be able to pull off games given without apple game consists of one of the things that people really talk before he has a lot of CPR it is relatively affordable in all disabilities are skillshots he's he's pretty easy to actually Focus so it may be trying to play around that it and keep nisky down here if that's the case we'll see how successful Mike young a few weeks are going to be able to be tackle box at bottom from the bottom about need to shape up the Cloud 9 side your third-place finisher from last in position to keep fighting her first place and it's a battle that they are expected to win any Team Liquid bidding off the game so maybe that's fantastic things like could be there even with the silence band there are the Restless not hear back that's going to be a good one it's actually electrocute your as well from Phoenix so very aggressive room cuz we haven't seen a lot more Fleet on Coursey that certainly is the standard approach but could be doing a little bit of extra damage here early menopause brain fog will be nice there for Jaco and Mike young is going to be hail of blades so this is a room setup which will allow you to park your knock up incredibly fast that third hit on the Q does go off so so fast with hail of blades and that was no a lot of what kind of lead to the champion you're terrorizing so if you terrorizing the jungle and with these four level two games and it's super aggressive ramped-up play and I think if you are trying to Target Midland and hey maybe grabbing you liked you for some little bit more aggressive makes more sense with that game plan then just one sleep 10 gold given over on both sides here is the war is killed and technically a blabber didn't get the money cuz he walked out of sweeper range and so only sneaky got it it's the most minor thing ever but technically 10 gold lost either way it's still a nice word to kill it's extra money is Dickies pocket next to you as well which I don't believe actually matters into on two lanes, but doesn't want no one to know you're at Taco Bell and follow going to walk out tonight I think that's a nice little move right you know if you do expect that they are releasing their walk up it's pretty easy to get that one little hit off with you be a little bit of gold Proctor II Men flow very early on in and get the guardian out of the way as well as novelty W start your for Apollo so this is very heavily leading towards that's enough clothes style that we did you see it is sorcery as a secondary here from Lucien so no it is manaflow band on him as well know that's really kind of what they're looking for other style do to fall out of favor a little bit thank you tax changes were they different increase the cost that you believe lbw and try to push that thang up a lot of the damage output is not be as high but rank one of its fine and yeah that's right it in despite the fact the guardian is the traditional answer to Pocono that is very helpful it is not going to be up for all of the Poke obviously coming in and and they're looking to try to attack the manifold Azazel and asthma attack of the long cool nouns in there looking all right well the first attempt to your 80 Cloud Nine with flapper in the topside and still it was with the early prepper there's the issue Landon going to mail flow is going to not flash it make a damage to your flashes back to the docket and it's going to be so lows going down first just seems to have worked out so much better you notes perhaps just getting at least being that big of a difference but he is level 3 is level 2 and and wasn't even able to be up there at the same time so the leash expedium up quite a lot in this game is basically unavoidable once solo is this far up as soon as you actually gets Low by the Jays you're just dead cuz we're going to see your load there fiber is really just going to wait and Hold the Flag drag until after you flash and at that point there's no really scaping whatsoever humo does end up committing his own Flash not come back and they can't even more of a sure thing but a nice fruli play their next Flagger Force play it's going to look nice right now C9 definitely want to be very best games in North America cultivating Talent find the right post Academy team if you're going to look pretty good on stage and another potential win column here for a blabber and Kumo as they sit on a pretty standard bottom laying here playing back black book with the candies and guarding the blocks of the damage and just think slightly down in Pharmacy what you expect to lose Lane slightly when your solution you mean it's just a graceful don't by the bank and trust laying down here forever but. Glass reveals and fog of war and tags in the face I can probably could have just flash on and then killed in there because he has no flash but you don't know that blabber isn't around right you know that is just a big? There so no blabber now knowing that that my king is one of them into the go ahead and take away those Rafters and certainly is going to be off to a very very good start and when you are playing at Jiffy like she's out who you really do need to get these are really feels to be getting an advantage because this is not what I would consider to be a strong Champion you know from even or behind know but so far he ain't got to say this is a been actually pretty close gay in the ultimate Farm difference is in the Rebecca Fox until it has like to get curlier on as we walk despite play out it's not great for the Gangplank be like the farm numbers and he's doing fine now you get the extra money because he's games like a horse that she was pretty little bit more extra is well and end of the day it's a tide game build wise and the fact that they kill went to the jungler and now you're posing top laner is always going to make you feel really good because at the end of the day what is Kubo get over the first assist and he used his flash has his flash school but you would probably Trace is 50 cold to have your Summoner back up and feel comfortable yet situation so I got 25 but still I would still make that she really is on bladder but we'll see you know if solo can get any sort of an edge from that and it might Young Who I think he is going to look to just go for a straight-up Lane gang runs great up there flash on the JC has no flash available so I went the heliblade you should be able to pull something off but well he's like a drink is on cooldown though when he shows an award instant before that thing decays down today make sure it's safe make you unable to be really part of this fight at all of the Jays but there's no way you're going to survive now that they are has actually arrived so then the play going the way up. Side and Phoenix you're not really going to get any sort of an advantage in the mid lane as a result of his either maybe it's a couple CF but you're a Viber shows up he is up a level so low just has no Mana so it's like the fact that he does actually blacked out Dodge is that flag and drag is going to get knocked down anyway it was such a good place for the Canik is a Kenwood level six that you didn't kill it so you can get the partial Manor refund on killing it with Q enough Mana to use the ultimate I know that feeling it sucks play where you lived it really was so tight so I can't really imagine for that it was really fall margins button cover blubber and small margins there but you know perhaps you could have allowed in that to be to have a chance at turning around and getting a kill on Jace either way things are looking good for Cloud 9 up all night Ops III but solo holding its own and in the farm at least until a force to walk back do taking a lot of damage now is this time to kill did to come through in the Flames licking the last unless close quick look at the bottom line is for the farm weed for phone Jaco do you want to point out there up 18 minutes that's really solid some white high so I want to give him props for that by letting their 7 minutes Rockwell yeah you know by comparison he has he has basically double the goals that diesel has earned at this point so very far
what is doing well. I think they're going to look good in and then there in their last game and it wasn't just who he was head FBI was very very well also we have came to do it for two games that's far they have been very aggressive in the whole time hoping for more of that sort of style yes it did not work out in their game against office because you're meet us had some incredible counter games that really just shut them down but I think this is an exciting look for the golden guardian and if they can consistently play aggressive and have success in that to be to have been golden Guardians may be a much better team than shown in the first half of the split the case they could be another split that has been into the playoffs this year as they can keep to get better over time and and I can see 5 and 5 vs 3 + 700 flights out of playoffs with only a few more to play eight games left counting this one and that we can see us 2 bands off for sites like was throwing a lot of enchanters to Fort Bend tackle the Guardians we can be, play other roles but I would be probably less than third one theredefinitely would not be too surprised I have also been playing no other message 4th like valve cause any sorts of things but certainly does have a pretty flexible champion pool in that regard and do with you even if you see him playing a lot of Roman gay types of War think one month Leona certainly has been a favorite of his though will be the stage 1-e final game here cuz he's available you need to know. Up and it's going to be a bit of a difference if you know this is certainly something that everyone was going to this is not that we know why I believe the graphic is incorrect or of an old lady back in her size and their house is going to be who he has been playing a more defensive role in the outside Lane anytime I see Tom can't have always done with wondering are we going to get no more heavy slip for style are we going to get that type of a working with the early so now you're expectingSpike Lee's donut Eric to be coming through here for a wild turtle and we need some can see other comment pairing with the donuts are even taking off the table it is possible that this is just going to be a standard bottle in her alongside the Sonos right because that is very abusive early but not a lot of willing to play that is too kind of phone Orville when she is looking forward to helping will Tomcat varicella can do a lot of damage in field healing reduction buy a playing the fairest time Kentucky had so many base that's going to walk if you want to hit them and you'll win the 212 so when we talked with old Gucci joining the Golden Gardens and giving him pointers and self who he of course was under a year since I've helped them out and he's already at 6 are locked in thereis no a media tech support agency that Eric right away band out and into your voice I feel like like like the leaving this up and say yeah go ahead dance in Fort Smith AR country down there about their Corky which were to Municipal Authority directly to be flexible if they want to get really tricky New York back in the Tariff band that does come through stylist very likely will be playback contract in the jungle we started a little bit you even at 9:12 and it's got major bus on 913 and really I think has skyrocketed to become the premier jungler don't know at least up there with Ted 1 T and is going to be very very strong a contract saying it because he does strike me like one of those wow this is going to be on top then I don't think so I think it's more likely so I am now it's doing this this is going to be Jarvan top right side jungle so really getting tricky here you know, with the pick ban and it is hard to know exactly whatyou're going to see you on the side of golden Guardians when you're not sure where things are going to go you're likely going to look for just the most stable planers things that are pretty blind pickle fries safe that's exciting as well now I want to posit the small chance of Tom kench top with support but I want to respect it I mean it's actually pretty good backed up in the Darvin Darvin support really sent for quite a while actually we had that seeks an Evac a p jarmon support is going to be fast or a style or if it is going to be more of a tank or damaged people were going Aries Jarvan Emax flag poke Digger team attack speed buff as wellFiora work from that I that is something that would make for both are very very scary in the later stages of the game I don't know how they're going to really match up in the Doobie to it feels like it's driveable have a very difficult time going for because if you engage in pumpkin just so powerful you know what I could turn that around on you if they can poke out that there is no with his E-maxx Jarvan perhaps and it ain't going to look for that service out that could work going to be getting a relatively early game anyway right you going to be the farming champion of the game so it's going to be almost certainly won't have the manifold that's too early for the East band butt and go see what this does look like of course you would be likely either so it does feel a bit rough for the black guy on the red team but it looks like in the long termLast Chance Auburn Al Lynn you'll give him these Summers and given out their room choices there I think neither side really should have a damaged actually no be able to resist retinol in 2 weeks unless they going down very heavily before that alright this should be very interesting really creative drive away thanks guys invert soda j4 bot Lane how is that going to work for you guys today so one of the things that counters of soda weigh knows he's seen his team sent to take the time country way and then try to have strong die presents DJ for prevent sad eyes compared to the pike which is what people normally try to pick so we prevent to dies with the Jarvan and then we make sure that the Sona gets the scale. While on the other side of the map were able to make plays as well and the drive-ins Affleck's when it so when were able to do that they think they're picking into German jungle but they're not that we get back on your counter pick as well and did you expect in return to the bot Lane in Dubai yeah we had an inkling especially cuz definitely know they were playing the Academy games therefore we kind of had an understanding of what FBI and who do you want to play a specially cuz they're newer bottle and they've only showing like certain amount of pics so we were prepared for that but thank you and best of luck to you and the team back to you guys variance think so and utilizing the Charmin to help prevent that I have to think that doesn't make sense to a long a line to take the exhaust and I do think to be fair it can be difficult to the flag drag NACA is actually a pretty powerful different if you mess up your dive at all and you are basically dumped their garbage disposer can help the delay but I definitely don't see this as newly of a defensive option is something along the lines of Tom kench so I will have to see how this does play out it is the East are so for which he's though he will be the farmer in then we'll see how he can be able to play this one out nearly level of far as he knows that the steering is a melee tahm kench is quite High there's so much damage of the chair lamp in early game defensively in last hit what he can you always expect Lil Wayne new Adidas going to do his very best to try to get some of that good to hear Danny going to walk backwards on a 94 gets the still sweet spots and I stopped by Hans there and with Frankie 1/4 of the lifesteal as well that jungle do you think of Jarvis but instead it is like the Rounds in Torrington to take hail of blades recti very powerful Hurley do list on this Champion so no should have your early game invented definitely in that won't be one and we'll see if you can be able to utilize. To get any service Co controller or anything along those lines but for now you can see both attended or pushing in or golden Guardians which is good to give contracts priority I have a both know where each other are as far as we was taught that shows since when walking topside clearing his fourth Camp right they are with the bloom getting hit nose contracts and down there by his own Groff and looks like you'll be trading Scuttle crab so it's kind of taken to South 1% we're heading Northwest again and just one that means he can be available if I came to last time active open contract with the math does get it but since we're not even going to actually check it out on it surprised by that you know perhaps does not feeling super confident and it's be able to make that invades and his new leader is still being plugged in but he did have the pushing top so I feel like at the me to consider actually might be going for an early blue donate at the very least thought he was coming over here to help cover but I do think this will be the first blue actually going straight over to fragen cheapest way to get talk to me really nervous in a cup out of the temple and say they were expecting the right side of his around new just in case that it did become a battle at that Blue Buffalo end of the day it is going to be normal us across the board but I get to your point I think you're right center when did have the space to probably steal that blew away. Took the tickets instead and his back on the map and you know he'll be fine for the rest of the time but it just ask what if that went a little bit differently around nice to you by honne tour length of second was well really doing nicely it's a lot of damage down and now contract where can I find that link I do believe there was a? Painting over on that War II they didn't know he's in the area since we're not just been hanging out waiting for a potential cake opportunity but now knowing this island is gear concert should be able to feel very easily push this out this will mean Viper has to expend the teleport end up getting that additional invented goes home with war farm and also can just walk this right back to lay and hold on let's see if he does so desire I want to see Piper picked out a freeze thing is as you mentioning the entire wave down again and I think could afford the TV instead made out of fries and and they don't lose an entire wave their the danger with a strategy like that because the wave was stacked so high as if you just use your TV and you take too much damage then you can start to lose control the plane simply because of a kind of Health Ephrata there so instead he will push that out who you like that bind to get another key for such as the one that attacked you track contract a little bit earlier and placing a pink they're over by that blubaugh till you're just trying to keep yourself safe to Ward's here I should keep them safe from anything besides of Central Link anklet that's going to be very hard to pull off with a knife piercing Arabic wildturtle very low who does FLOTUS me to get back to Lane he's 40 May 1st recall for the frosting itself but here is almost ready to go then you can make that a reasonable recall on to it until then though who is the just kind of protective Stone allowed to skill-up I would say accomplished thus far do you have Farm barely equipment on both sides who generally do expected the stone Elaine's to be pretty far down and they will be able to get a reasonable by off the back to base FBI is going to be like that teleport to try at the very least Force out the teleport from his own it but this wave will be pushing towards him back so they may be keeping contracts down here and trying to put my question cuz it's awkward position where they need to reset the way they need to push out and doing that would expose themselves, no matter what as the recalls come out through nose and Silas and do a little bit of magic from there is so I guess it fits that bill recently well it is to Max on this driving by the way so not the flag attack you is simply Allure cool down the Q and we're on her pain that's Pretty in Pink building a Bissell does give you a little bit ER as well and we can do actually go up to your completed side Sonja gazinski are there also so I'm having a little bit of that in the mix and hopefully we'll get Tanked app that you can actually actors that primary it should be magic damage camping or afford two of his Primary Care Easley Stone automatic damage the Corky who is almost entirely magic damage so it does become Mormon offensive in that regard as well and makes sense for Bissell mask in this team competitions pretty cool stuff and really really across the map it is fairly slow pace as far as the lanes are not playing Super aggressive will Guardians is going to make this move now and I haven't pushed in bot Lane having the pushing midlane a little bit they are the first one to make a group on this move up and it looks like if I question just happy he's afraid of giving up and we'll be dropping that over but and we have seen of the zipper bootie I think from stand for in this split to the Pixies are looking Champions and not always be as aggressive with them with you time from a lease and jarvin them down but it is pretty well played by Woody toe peeling knock up denying the rain for the cataclysm there from contract so it does keep him safe but a lot more aggressively into the past has been working stats cosplay this farming out of style are they do have very good feeling so maybe the right size is used more to match the early game but it's a good thing when you hear in her talking about the idea of getting the jungle counter pick and then just seeing it become a appear far matchup yeah FairPoint will be sent when does gout in the board and out in the map in GTA V action before too long the right now is the first for the aggression for Golden Guardian The Sims look in the bottom River and I'm going to finish taking a break with normally around for the divorce is the boss playing at work again
tournament and it's a building hide it is Building height again underdogs absolutely sooning are one and seven against hockey the fort in the LTL all year long. One game was back in week 5 of the spring split it's been a lot of wins in a row for many peoples trim its side and top-view sports the question remains which of these teams will try the third strike LPL world champion expecting a torn been on the side of spooning one of the big differences between these two teams is the Top Lane and it was very big in the last matchup that they did have in the semifinals plays Carrie's game since he had an orange came that they actually played it and that was one or an in a sea of Carrie Top Lane Champion for them they have been to every single game of the World Championship thus far and I've got one then left to do it or will they break their patternwill it be 12:00 3 + 9 makes it is it going to be sore or Ben or someone else betting a sin away and going off with this one I mean you're seeing through Graves Kindred mentally are the three biggest Wranglers at world so far Lilia has not been played by car salt long World included as though so gin made me to take away from love is taking away one of the best pic bed soon and have found success without this isn't to say that the only area that they have obviously his Misfortune bottom line was also extremely strong but again your point on the jungle pinching here is very big with also First Take not being used by tati for to try and take away the other comfortable Champion that cars that has shown he is gone to the lease in after the grave the Middle East has been taken awayand they are going to get a feel of their own so both team opening up this pic fan attacking the other team's comfortable Champions here and he's very interesting I want to thank him again for one song is the likely bot Lane and what they thought it was interesting that is recent shooting pics and banned throughout world they could replace standard to on twos every single as real game they've played it a long engagement every time he has played Aspen alongside Lulu the gym taken away the headphone Duo pics there was well we'll see if I do come through overall instantly set gift grab and bring to see the pic now for maybe night has been the most flexible mid laner that we've had at World's End he could play this at Oriana didn't do so good to be extremely likely as when you're facing and Oriana now on the side of tuning either want to go with an assassin to try and attack her close range or outrank it was doey I think that Zoe has beenAngel one of angels best Champion to ride up there with the syndra probably even be best to try and grab something for him before the second round of band come in Oriana really excelled in the Midfield that mid-range getting a couple of extra levels into the W so you can clear that way he doesn't go with the Zoe as they're also has the extra range so he could do a similar thing to know the second round of the bands coming through a to go to pick his sixth unique champion of Worlds night had played nine across 11 games and not there is no Yona that again was played every single time alongside the Ezreal set with next in line behind that one for that one was early taken away likely going to you and Jeff down the bottom side and not going to be really high priority for them then because sooning as we said before are primarily pretty much always play carries for bin and it will need somebody to engage for them sort out is be engagedare for the team has come of talking about he's also one of these big shock collars cause those engages later on into the game credits I would say though yet not unless these other hard engage support Scooby what TSR trying to Target here deny them from Sword Art and I'm expecting to see the support grab pretty early from TuneIn top Esports more than any other team in quarter-final onward 40% counterfeit rate and he's in the west side is that Red Sox to guarantee I'll roll guitar what been terrific is going to be part of gays here is locked and they get to work on or sort out one of the biggest play making shape it's in the game I love its combination with leasing as well he can actually sing cupsoh well with at the lab and they both have the gases you can play some really interesting Vision games by hopping over walls and allowing your teammates and then hop to you but it's a very quick double-locking hear Pantheon or very aggressive play on their own side to with the point-and-click sun and the dates very very powerful later for the topside difficult to go with a canopy chair for been up since they're Camille is band out that one of the ones we're usually try and get a hectic ultimatum set him up for cancer killed the Wukong exactly what they use in the semifinals yeah into its weight in the reverse match up and that was actually the best game of that semi final four or soon and we're then was able to get a council kill in the TV one rose will be the first this time. Was 3 6 9 on the Jason the reason you always get that Wukong very often to the types of these dudes extra armor and regeneration from his passive do you trying to stack up and then look for your all in opportunitythe Jade try and get the kill and that's going to require jungle attention all I will say though we work on getting the stack armor via his passive and probably early didn't happy as well he's got a set jungle just I'm really physical as well so it's similar damage typing typing you've got an armor stacking top 100 natively that's going to look pretty good for been over all is that set up against 369 that is going to be a tough matchup if you're going to play My Player you're really going to ETS favorite almost down the line but if you step on the day and you do about what needs to be done then you're great and I do want to interject on this in the semi-finals this wasn't such a catastrophic matchup for spooning because of the emphasis that top put on 2369 Renekton devastating counterpick in the favor of 369 plus they sent karsa to gank his Lane early for him getting him first kills in both of those games do itjungle attention resources it is graphic resources so much that copies for trying to funnel into 369 to get that winning top side by funnel 369 in the early games 369 in the late game is a player of the absolutely playthrough is Harold 1.27 a game that they play around topside is that dragons for it by the way they have a very low person I can percent at 15 minutes on average they are playing around top five in the early games and you got this matchup we'll see how much carsick can be up there but on the other side was going to happen for sooning around the bottom side we saw how well one song played in the quarter file his Djinn from inside the base get a champ. Still in the way he's still outstanding there dragon controls excellent soothing playing around the bottom side most likely we'll see how it shapes up though because you got a bowl tonight up topside regardless and we can figure out which team can play around ityeah and we should start off this game by painting the entire picture from those semifinals because while there was you know counter pick topside lots of gangster up early on to the topside which resulted in a big c s leave for 369 there also was a big CS lead for Jackie love and you Yonder in that series and it was mostly self weren't in various matchups for them into Hong Fang and sore. And that's where the components that people are expecting to change because at World bong bong and sword art have really stepped it up this has to be one of the differences for sooning to make sure they don't get a similar result as they did in the LPL a lot of phase one side lot of conqueror on the others going to help him do just not in this match of course already won upset win with the quarterfinals going on at the wife am I like this trying to play on the Debby's much as possible to get off it never gets it going he's going to be just fine overall in Sleepless blue on one side laceless red on the other foot.path that will get them at toppling around 3 minutes 10 seconds level 3 double bass ready to go ready to rumble full match of around 3. I'll talk to you look like you're so far for the music. Especially with the chase because for Chase Another One Bites the Dust year for Jaso especially with with hitting this yet you also need to try and find that harassment for Leon to the Wukong pushing up the Cs there you get access to the brush Advantage then you can get off your cues get off your auto tax on the Wukong dropped into the breast to drop to Agra from those minions so you can drop off some of that extra damage back in China whittled down that Wukong early on to open it up as an area for your jugular try and take advantage of and you meant to the starts for both junglers Huron play making jungle champions for the early game both of them starting their routes on the bottom side clearing up towards top and you can see there's already a defensive War here from 360in the jungle to see if sofm tries to make his way there wait to see the match up those come out to being much right now bottom is being pushed in on the top Esports I'd not going to do anything cuz no one goes around was just nine Farm underneath the turret in very heavy clear for us while I'm going to leave early but the crowds most likely I should say Carson making his first award and still 16 but I think his entire left side and it took control and that's what time is very efficient really really high goal difference for jungles at World's End it. Was the same in the semi-finals as well you know there was a 30 c s Lee at 1.4 sofm even got a solo kill on the 369 but Carson did so much more for his plane actually getting those gains off and he is on the set that definitely relies on that play making so we're looking at Pantheon Lane you can definitely try and play out their point and click into the set and Gage provide oh my gosh play making when you add a gin on top of that even with a flat it's easy to try and take down that killed because you get your W-2 route from your gin after the flat and you're able to secure a long song of course does have cleansed but he's aware of the possibilities of the CC stacking bottom land that is looking for kill pressure and Ice-T board comes down from Sword Art what's the middle Brushwood can track them the link and can move and we prefer dad likes to knock out the 2 on 2 fact that go good dammit Jackie love more or less lose that Fred but he's got reason you went for the boots multiple potions situation he can step away from some Avicii Odyssey plenty of region not a problem down there and buy weed in job make sure they know that both Emma's back down to decide then they took all six camps then then went back for the second response and speaking of potions I got to keep track of the Wukong potions as we're talking about the dates trying to constantly Whittle down this Wukong the 9ps under the turret had to bring the potion really early on does have biscuits who's got the arrival there any train this pain under the tower but this is a match up where we can just tries to scavenge through yet and and try and save life until you get your level six point that's why the Wukong is picking TJ's you will come down there with your passive armor and and regeneration within Wukong at level 6 we conquer you have tremendous all in Kill pressure on the Jace and this is where 360 I'm thinking of very intelligent recall right now to go back because that's where jungle pressure starts to look towards the top side from the Wukong player sfm suspend power clearing head down this entire beginning of waiting for him to get level 6 to have that possibility and he's 4 seconds later on the recall basically split equally by the Cool Breeze 369 and and that means honestly so far so good doing better than last time they met and I want an ounce as time to Ford we are 2 minutes of the rift Herald spawn the Drake is already alive right now at the S having pressure in the Box side it's usually pretty easy to drink and kind of guarantee that nothing is an Iowa sneak breast with them but if you go based on projector. History at some point he's going to grab this for a stray cat going to go ahead and grab that first held well already looking into the river for car sub looking to try and preempt that play from sooning he has been keeping up in farming with the leasing as well for asset which is very good number sense sofm it's been our farming away on the lease in he will get the crab the carson-speaks around to get that deep Ward and Jake have teleport a good pick up there and is it to grab the Scuttle rate in time cars anyway and you may be known the timing is to offer assuming they had to push in the wave Andre, I love the flavor top Esports they shoved in bottling what's the problem in finding us back to recall big playing the topside been forces the flash away from 369 but hey that's okay you can go and get my ass out no big deal we got Drake here on CSI and it's actually even better than okay for the confidence to get that has flashes traded because you're cool down for your ultimate comes up much quicker and you can repeat for the threat of those kills dragon. Going over to BS as you mentioned good Advantage there for a while because of the backing of the bottom Lane and we'll see if they can actually make something with the extra Global Ciara panteon about to hit Level 640 on use one of those players on TS that would take advantage up most heavily in their series vs fnatic and this was an area that people are trying to think I'll maybe soon and will to repeat that success that fanatic have you know maybe there was
in North America right now they just beat Team Liquid and that was with their new top later rookie come again is stepping in for electrician and Soldier killed in the incredible debut taking down in back taking down PL he was strong in this key as well was very big in that game is Veigar was so so powerful and he said that he wanted to bring out a lot of different chance can you want to experiment to bring out somebody's War weird chance than any he didn't look really comfortable against it as truth of a guy was really effective and that was pretty impressive right now they're not getting banned away we'll see what does coming through what we are play champion in Rumble more than double any other day and he hasI'm in the tournament makes sense also a different look for them I don't believe we have seen any human game I wonder if they're going to be able to grab something along the lines of this differ we've seen that before the effective super yummy I think it's is one of the strongest people with the long side it at being able to hit that problem projectile you get a slow and then the boomerang blade become very easy to connect with the multiple part of his ultimate by popular the speed up their the Cape Town potential Wisconsin's clothes can be very very strong also some pretty interesting which indirect and they're going to go see you at the drops do shake up one thing I ate early game average off of Torrid at 15 minutes they have eight or nine games of the game so far in the LCS that's actually been pretty exciting overall I like the smile is it not even enable Siri on here talking about I think she was really good and certainly Jace look like that yesterday I know this is pretty much always been the answer feels like fuyumi people are all mostly to establish baking that as an answer in an egg without a couple times yesterday it's really strong all in the game store because you're not getting an additional damage would you make such a big difference in the all-in and if you are separated you're very very formidable taxi 4th down yourself so heavy comp some of the things that used to run in Spring I doing some serious real packed stuff would not be shocked to see that added in but as real first movie is going to be in the lot if not no certainly I think pretty in an all-in-one mid laner but either way again because of the week engage TV about hard seats reliable at that on every c9m I wonder if we'll see something along the lines of Draven band or Illusion I think those can be quite a bit since now so early game he is much more known as part of a leaking fuel fighter that's more his style are we did just see Draven Ottawa to new and very well yesterday though. We have the solution. Let's be pretty effective interest as well I generally go through aggressive really gay maybe these are the ones that are more likely be able to punish but okay I guess it could be flushed around but one of these is most popular Casio with was being placed A Ton Tony was dominant honest or going to sitting here as well and I was actually going to Champions going to eat and then you know I definitely don't think that they're going to want to be to go in a full physical yeah would make some sense I could be pretty interesting but I might be getting it one more time play forward the Jason the side lane you than kind of have it this early Roman Squad of TF but they didn't they can move around the map and try to make this time I have heard about this I have her to call one of the most extreme counters in the game II don't know if it's actually going to play out in that way but I'm very excited to see if that is the case to mate here bringing out dead fetuses feel like that type I'm excited we saw that I love it I'm excited about this immediately really confused across from Friday the 4th. So it's going to be exciting and learn ways to flex their Champions around when you get a new hear another non-standard game here for Clutch Gaming Sona band away and said Cody Sun Pilots us dead I really want to see you is that going bad or is it actually said Nautilus spot cuz I'm kind of struggling to see it I mean I guess you're going to have to call them to Central there but farming early seems like it would be so hard against you be an Israel a lot of folks are still there as they're also out of my sisterly well into into your early armor a big going lines of the ice-born could make that more difficult but he is certainly positioned on the bottom side and her for the chats I've had a really was expecting to be Zed mid because that is a match of that it had been very hyped up quite a bit as an answer to see if what's been gaining popularity buenos soon we will have interview with Mixcraft we running him up in a minute so we can ask him directly just was special about this and when I hear word will pass that over but meanwhile Jimmy had initially sent Khalifa another bottom now we walk backwards mid so it does look like they are pushing those players to their respective roles that said he'll be a mid laner but piloted by Cody sent that makes way more sense to me I just think it's so important to actually get the expiry so later on these assassins that needs to hit those break points out to be able to be effective in the game thanks guys I did Chase down coach mix crack asking about Cody Sun spot Atlantis for Cody sun and that's surprisingly he's really good in that position so I'm excited to see it back to you guys and learn W and try to Jack the blue buff and how many free throws flash over the wall for that tonight I'm saying like 100 there's like yeah there's like Spence Karen and mlxg does little people are already taken but that'll leave one by showing your yeah and that's why I haven't done yet might come in we'll see what happened to him in a while for us we saw two level one came in and pushed him off made him burn teleport the very beginning of the game that is a another missing some of that mean I don't have a friendly date has been pushed back quite a bit of you. The man he was up in one second could have easily queue Smite it's not about whether he had two flat for the next 3 minutes. Also I got he's a boss I guess Battle of a nail talk to corporate me to giant fish will see what else happened to the audience that song is old man I've heard in the last Nikki going to be a lady up here again to the syndra that does seem like I think like a much more difficult matchup then was the last game you have really good push even when they were killed off in the last game they were able to actually do get if you have to bandage over FBI as well as who he wave was pushed forward so if it's going to be an acre almost landing and defending clutch will go to a weed this way is down so down goes through the minion remind me to low Mana today are actually just using it to try to reset but for now I'm going to get the reset because they're at their willing to take up a little girl sitting on a Teleport to want a very likely will have to teleport back in and just try to get this wave reset what team is that is scary to do because you have no idea where the lease in is there at the tour Duty be back in you could just be in seeing it so he's going to have to actually make the tell for into the river and interest rate to slowly walk for it and make sure that gets loose at the bottom and middle is going to text images of Fate I know we mentioned in champ select the need for some magic damage potentially in this roster and Misty will steal deal some stacked deck of course of magic damage fix card wild-card contributions there but it is still attack damage GF tells me that they're looking for more I think definitely can work and C9 has not been seen that is as ever really been afraid of it. you are some big damage on PC will be as real some from the TF and then you me is is adding some magic damage in there so it's all bad we will see exactly what sort of style of beer I want to go but lira in a cook at the preferential itemization if he wants us to a full tank before backup the armor that could be helping him out I think in a world where you have quite a bit of damage on your squad already maybe he's got to feel free couples to do that country calls coming through Kumo Fort without TP get 3 longsword to take the long way back up to the Lane and he's okay Walk This Way over now and who need I think it's actually holding on to somebody with fries up here the wave is bigger than two most I think it'll be actually a lot of Farmall 230 C is 29 to 45 FPS and it's going to get worse for him so toppling going well so far and I got a lot of iron by the fact that that level one was very brutal and of course the Tepee out spot putty telnet looking to try to set up any potential all in this key the other advantage of kind of going for this phase Rush when you are going to the ADP app is the early on right yes. Washroom he's waiting for that to my life is sitting behind him and maybe she can walk for a little bit more lyrics flag and dragged away a lease in was around I didn't bring the big Summoners any big cooldowns and made him so again here he knows how process of a d vs yuno a p on the TF certainly I think at this point would be even if you had like Secret Agency is more useful but at the same time I'm building to his Tony has nearly as easily which is so helpful against his head and unless you want to do some 30 hybrid not sick but there's a lot of damage that was really well done honestly no chance for who he be rather once he's use the ultimate there's no way you're going to go without play that so 59 very clean dive doesn't cost them a Summoner Mickey and Daisy will be pushed back office for a little bit then lose a plate. But looking like not much more than you know the few CS is as well as her place is certainly much better trade 459 on the top side especially when you realize he was starting to really win that length quite a bit and Elmo needed to help you really bad back over Top Lane
that's true we're here and we are already underway in Champion Select your for the first game of the day echo-fox with their silly changed up brought their gear Mike young moving back in VLC s back on stage and be hunting for his first win with Echo Fox hope they turn it around 4 at the old being with Rush was that he would never lose on Sundays but true bass record so far currently in last place we could have turned things around with nine games to flag has not been so good recently why but we know they have the talents to go back up and I mean a lot of people have been pointing towards their bot Lane as as that weekend step Lionel a had not been performing up to the standards that we are you through from them and I think that's a big reason why we're seeing FBI as well to he squatted in in that bottom Lane yesterday and it did not work out for them either they did get very far behind but certainly I think a lot of the credit was it from me.he was there for all the counter Gangsta they were going to force on the bottom side and arrow got so fed on this Draven so interested to see a second appearance your for FBI and who he and find out if they can actually match up well against Parliament Aqua I was like to believe in New Edition so I'm still stoked for Mike young still stoked for FBI and who he and we'll see who can have a better results here today both you 4th did lose on Saturday 21st that much of a surprise bill on 9.12 definitely Queen of the Jungle and the most craft phases in early Lux here expecting us to be support for who he other at the possibility of it being placed around there it has also been in the cademy and then some other areas working some gragas support who he actually being one of the guy who had played this little bit away is going to be a great if you have 200 cough so they are actually taking the yasso away from Golden Guardianyour draft and you do have to knock up salon size it's as well write the cute eyes actually a knock up there from 2:20 that allows you to all of knowledge are you a multi minakov evening out as Folk has a slight little grab that you can all the off of so we'll see what the weather is going to be and it will definitely is making me feel that this is probably a Sephora in that bottom Lane playing alongside of you know pretty aggressive a d e r I think you could play it with lots but make a little bit less than me cuz didn't really want to go for the support of all in style of play If you are going to be drafting quit that at the pro level only the way it's too aggressive Lane as a grown up or FBI Lucien yesterday and did have an early CS leave with me as a counter gang Center in that laying around but it's still the same sort of look for the golden Guardians do overly Lena crashing through the game power as you're saying about the gragas being elected support that does seem to line up he had one on earlier so far that splits is one of his better chanceVolkswagen still wait to see what comes out of the end still possible for Less reflex around right you know you could still put that in the jungle you could still put the lock before it based on what the matchups are based on what has actually been selected for Echo Fox though Advantage there in terms of flexibility I think of where the things are going at the osmo you could theoretically be going to three lanes but Apollo does not really strike me as a player I've not seen solo really play it either so I'm certainly expecting a decision bidlane yasso here forever. I may be one of their players will prove me wrong but for now I think that is where I will be assuming it's going I think that's where he's going to Sue is going as well as champion in as many games and wait to see if that is indeed what happens here is the final bands come through Nico and a collie band outs they are expecting solo to still have his top cleaner to grab later on we're seeing Brown Band of wipes in case there's a pillow support to be seen in LeBlanc away from frog in a case that Lexus down there just kind of covering both basesnever know for sure if blind Renekton going to come through and came to the osawa so you could actually be taking his Renekton and give it a Haunter and just have him follow the author on the map for either so lame so you're that is a very strong early matchup you also relies pretty heavily on being able to be very evasive on actually look out playing a lot of still shots and eat or something came down and you could be looking at something like a Renekton put the grass in the jungle very strong ganking Duo there who could look who abused this gas well then you're getting locked in does make me think that hey maybe there's actually going up there to solo acting flat on your back when we have Instinct you are Marching In the bottom Lane but we will see what he ends up flying it's going to be probably also or this been aroundGangplank topping and Yasuo mid or bot I am going to guess that this is Apollo Stendra and Phoenix yato we'll see if it does become the cases Phoenix certainly I think the most experienced player out of that group but other is the ability you know that these players have to have been practicing these pick could be grinding on those pics especially with Rift Rivals Whitney needed yesterday so many bands harborage Wars yeah so a lot more respect than given to the pic at people really saw the effectiveness of it from a lot d d l e c teams are 590 brought it out before if Rivals DL as well use the average travel to great effect in it is going to be swapped there so as expected Phoenix will get the also and it will be the Tinder up off Galaxy brain is not coming Apollo on Sandra and Phoenix is Indy going to grab the Osco and as you mentioned Headhunter follow him around the problem is bell cost is not a good top laner No Escape long Lane slow movement that's going to make that hardleaving you know this is mid lane alone I think with him when the vel'koz gets locked in you may just be opting out of that throws drag do you know if this isn't relly made or something like that equal becoming more flexible but certainly not the case so I guess we will just have to spell pus forming bid against the office tomorrow and we are going to likely have Renekton vs. GP top when I can certainly am at the Kent bulle GPU very heavily for early on but we all know how strong he is as far as stealing it solo has turned into a very good game play performances to win frecklebox this year was a gangplank are they was against Eli did very well for this will meet what he picks them locked in not guaranteed it was pretty likely we are on Fox 2 and 7/8 mind for wind is Fort Lee in playoff position right now there's that big tie for first at 6 and then a two-game barrier for the next Squad 2 certainlyit's possible to make playoffs pill with 9 2 Play-Doh things teens can make that search yes it's really interesting you can see it's actually Fleet footwork on the Osco door and shield and exhaust so pretty defensive setup your early on to be able to kind of survive all this boat that the vel'koz can potentially for a while now you can block the vel'koz you with your rent while you cannot block the W you cannot Block B R I do actually think of the eu's blockable as well I'm not a hundred percent sure on that but that is how I actually remember that interaction that it doesn't count as it a little bit of a projectile and we'll also really going to have to come and see how comfortable does Apollo look on this end Resto + Nautilus does strike me as a lame where they're going to be trying to push you have quite a bit of a OE try to shove in and and kind of deny any potential pressure coming out from this Calista with that sort of strategy also at level six you having night you have it's such easy set up for this kind of the week you know if you would get any sort of Lockdown from the Nautilus that pretty much guaranteesLanders done and Auntie play right here we saw Phoenix Atlantic you onto the Raptors why does the camp Fontana walked over to the Lane so we can get the tornado a little bit sooner than normal but Frogadier Pokemon Sun to manaflow band timer as FBI and who he got to put the shields up a troll against that kind of watch the old nephew has put in the Autos in Apollo got to be very respectful here really like the start of the shield there from who he I think it was very intelligent instead of just starting key for a little bit of hope both members and you just are Auto attacking and level one you're going to heavily out math any simple dinner so they can grow back towards you in and you can see that is a strategy drop the W walk board before those Auto attacked him and try to put them down if we were all so far have been couple other else get the 4th also start that one cast of Basil game yesterday with similar thing and forward they gon Ice Cube's going to land and to go for an autorun not just yetdo I do with Carlos and who he going to earn 11 Gold Cross actor that Dad going to be able to stack that up a fairly easily at least in the early level II I'll give it more careful nice little jump away their from FBI to avoid that her from aqua and if you ever do get hit by one pair of Assisi the fall of is going to be there but you also have to remember it's pretty much a one way trip usually if you are looking for those Menthol in CSE pretty damn sure that you're going to be able to feel them off because if you fail are you are going to be in some trouble with that passes stacking up the Spears and you can potentially just died from the case your contract now playing in the bottom side of the map there doesn't seem to be any chance to take though is the crugs already gone so I want to look good answer for a dive here I think they are going to find damageairport already call is true all right that was this early dye-free 4 minutes or they get them both all their sum is well and they don't even lose a member that was very well handle there by the golden Guardians juggling this a grow back and forth if you are going to actually look to start it up and they do for a back road gear to FBI just bought back over onto who had the Aftershock and then just kind of costly resetting this contract flashing out they now wait for the cooldown to come back up Hit The Binding who he walked out after taking that first PowerShot in the are eventually able to get that final kill as apology fuse back in but no one left around for him to try to take down a huge point of strength and I'll keep mine Golden Garden I have teleport themselves was Apollo's back in the lane with a dark steel back to farming it'll be a long walk back for FBI bologna made that trip a long story people in farm most of that gold and I really did go to who he so he is going to have that early Frost Bank and he's feeling pretty good about that and you have it on these reports can be pretty effective actually know will allow him to stack up at frosting a lot faster gets Woodside still more quickly and new even work towards things like that pees a lot earlier on in the game which is going to give them a quite a bit about an hour and I generally feel like it it feels a lot better to get those skills on a sport like lots than it does if you have a content for a bra or something along those lines video super job very well as we put back in the mid lane frog and left again for as much as you can that you can see he's out of mana and getting pushed to his limits here is Phoenix is coming in pretty costly for snow manifold to be worried about it Beyond suicide exactly and then I think that's pretty key because this is not a Teleport vel'koz write this he's actually playing Glen doesn't answer to potentially you know the Szechuan East on the the knot later on if he starts with being so mean if it's just nonstop shoving him in the baking and stay around and use establishing a nice disadvantage as a result of these two ways ahead now we'll see how much of this problem can pick up but the longer foggy days are the harder it gets actually Buena maintained with this woman and there was crazy as well as even though contract with you would have to be pretty dangerous is level 5 blue Smite jungler threatening in a potential or abandon is Phoenix and know that it's a one do you want anyway if you chose up the case you can see both of us here on the bottom side they don't know exactly where I might young is so it's allowing following Jaco don't sit on this free stuff for a bit longer than perhaps they otherwise would be able to you can see FBI and who he were trying to shove it in with their long-range abilities but still having to be respectful the fact that sends money could be there because they're only ward in that box outside jungle you actually had expired thing they really have no vision in this area at all and that is make Place go safely and it's also wife on track is getting cold down we'll see now if the Guardians can kind of make them into any sort of engaged but at the very least contracts is protecting them to push it increases wave safe well played right there Golden Gardens are playing around bottom side and again this is what you expected me pick of draft like this they grabbed the early Calista they wanted a Lane Bowie and they got just that and a punch the bottom Lane Red Bluff has respond they know where this Camp was started and looking for Phoenix actually yeah not the red bus to the Midland gang so I can has a manifold hear Here Comes be tempted beyond the scoreboard now is well 320 really nice move out to take priority and just show up Vapor Phoenix and rightfully hold on to those summer I think it was no escaping that one was going to get down you're going to have to knock up there so much all of CC so it will get Dylan they should brothers Dragon for themselves as well golden Guardians out to a very strong early start never was swept out blast comes over Lanza site at least something is on the board freckled fox actually has my side I do believe I actually stayed around and help to finish that off your FBI I went back towards Elaine and then did you get punished for that now if I the tops I don't want their very loud house is the rest of the damage so low as to kill solo on the top Lane killed by a GP early on is going to feel so bad for Han sir this is a match of that it was just going to get tougher with time and solo going to be feeling so good about his position now in this won't be one
is that the teams are loading in the Champions like the prescription for Team Liquid is more of the same for cloud nine we're interested to see how Kumo does out here on the estate thank you very much welcome back by the first place Team Liquid the new and returning pride of North America LCS titled three-in-one at Rift Rivals against Europe's best cloud 9 hoping to see what they can do not quite at full power licorice taking time off to mow stepping in for him and stop playing and we have a battle at 2 top-of-the-table team and one of my favorite things about Kumo is that he will play pretty much any champion in the top when he plays K he plays Carrie's he plays a fee he played a d d plays range Lane reapered especially a lot of Versatility hair and that's something you always looking for with the team is how creative and again and can select so far it's a full Target of for JJ trying to get all those support band out of the common strategy vs. Team Liquid diet silkworth quite valuable keep mine still 9.12 no Athens Beaver nurse just yet on this date was Iraq on definitely great Duo one that liquid has played four times already in there a game so and I think they probably would be coming through that is the very very experienced on the champion was an answer with what's timbercon I'll probably these two premier support that are left up and they still has been able to use both fairly effectively we're vs. Ted Lonnie there's not a lot give it away so Universal tank junglers extremely powerful because they buffed up the second swing of the W damage has been taken down yet but we're still on I-12 and out tonight to make their choices they are not really concerned that taking away to saira Khan. Early on has his random at Camp has look good so far there is frontal a very common town to pick into said after shock or not good for the champion you have temporary bonus armor Mr before joining combat that can be quite a bit and I wait to see what you look at on their side and they talked about how Cloud9 take more risks than how they just want a stable opening and if if they don't you give up some sort of big play than they think they are the better team on the side family by xxxtenticon a draft in that way and draft himself some Stable Lane sick bastards wanted to work around in the jungle you have your front line tank now they've got aatrox one of the biggest spiders which impact has performed extremely well on boat in the LCS and in the international play she's not going to grab their prize Duos I reckon they willing to let that slipped down the band phase and grab other Champions League scores right now just paid to the game but I got to get up early Corky here and put that most likely on the tennis competition North America right now all rights AP Power from the mid lane here they do you want a balance of damage types of scales Gilchrist coming through as well as the Trinity Force start definitely has a lot of power duration being pushed up or I mean the package acquisition time for your first one to be a run only change it was in the normal patch notes diametrically opposed or graft yes we have a possibility for liquids unless Corky's wants to double it going to be the Zoe answer pretty common in to Corky here to move to taking that one off the table for nycki I'm definitely breaking both of those two powerful bottom Lane pieces that you can still have to look at played a lot of stone Elaine at Rift Rivals there's a couple more often. Maybe you are indeed playing Lots at Sephora Corky's in Des Moines farm and out looking for fishing for stairs to hit and such as you can bring up trundle over with a pillar they could set something up but it it down as being harassed CA Frost early I think it's a super super nice matchup for Jason signs Bend I ate rocks some snowballing is early lame take it a couple of her hit so if if they protect Kumho on the topside you know it's busy get some control the Scuttle crab be sub top winter here for cloud nine could actually become the star of the mat this could look really nice right here and not just a severe for this matchup doublelift Saint Lucia court today on Brown definitely a very strong do Elaine double as low as play aggressive Land of Illusion certainly is because he's not be played to win Lane but you know if we'll try that and up against cloud and their last call wow I don't know squat back in the world 2015 so I could be exciting and the chances of roundness key on the Veigar Mid Cape and back into it how cold play that support role first then we did get another bid Lane wine and wasn't me see how I get through the early horses farming up your AP first and the ultimate is Good vs all types of Champions first image navigate around the cage as well I kind of like this Cloud 9 style there was Jason Todd so ecstatic actually focused that area that match silver and we will try and you're clear waves and stay away from the Lucian Brom cuz just do it all over again rhyme to do and blocking is Savers a boomerang than one fighting gyms in North America are doing a battle right now liquid looks good at Rift Rivals Cloud 9 not full Powers then maybe not know how either but still a good team overall great players on the roster and it's going to be an exciting one let's get ourselves into this game as be looking at Cloud 9 space off the clothes out the first round robin how many people were super excited to see Kumho on the LCS stage she had that single gang off game on gangplank Victory now he's going to get some real time to shine Jace is something that you can really try and get out to an early lead corrupting potion picked up for your more harassment here so you try and throw out those Autos as often as you can on a Stock's Dodge back into the brush to drop minion aggro and try and get an early Health lead but with the Veigar pick anything to talk about what this game is thanks guys coach Cloud 9 is coming off of a pretty disappointing Rift Rivals running you're going against Team Liquid it's your first match back so what's the team thoughts come into today and you know we'd recovery process too. From the last Reaper driver but obviously it's really talk to play against Team Liquid right after the recovery process but you know we feel good and I hope we can play well against him because right now I'm not worried about corridor do not worry at all Reaper thank you best of luck to you back to you guys and we all know this one actually enjoy we had a lot of all chat already in this game to give you a quick rundown for those who aren't on probe you immediately Spence Terence is oh now you want to go on your teeth fair enough, getting the early harassment as in fact his back to Lane as well so we can also pick up all the kids doing it once yesterday chart unlucky in fact already falling behind an NA J's can you imagine put an NA Academy Jace not anymore in there let's go bottle filled early and they try to go just yet but it does get a bit of pressure does C9 Duo early on if they are pushing forward. Sticky using his patented skin as well with the pizza delivery Lovett trying to get there early push as you mention if they can get into the turret really they can move up Frank it a war here to see xmithie cuz 650 did starts on the blue side of the map he is going for the house and starts we can still do all these camps on the red side but it is a power clear for stage 1-e trying to farm it out extensively early going to go onstage make sure everything is in order but that is going to be my next area of focus is the bottom half of the map and it looks like dazel did use that time after pushing the minion Wave 2 bruised up and get a ward into the tribe rush so if it's Smitty does finish up the full clear is going to have to find a q over the back of the Dragon pit or something or go through the lane you can actually Lane cake with Lucien Brown pretty effectively cuz you can stack up those Dunson trying to force that engaged and neither one can blanks you can run down the left no problem either he is the one who don't know if that was because it's his issue or not but he was one who typed in the command for wait to hear what this is all about over all of it going to be in game one thing is you actually think I've heard recently from players is it likes to me about sneaky in Lane dies Lenny faces is not very good but what I've heard is actually his Lenny face has gotten a lot better these actually a very good later it's actually Azazel who is a his guilt is not so much in lady but his overall mid-game shot calling in Sault Ste nines generally slightly big Lenny face I do not speak anymore typical 80 karrie freaky rap you said you know just putting one out for my homies sneaky that he's he's not the problem fair enough. I know the last time we saw Veigar frog and was tweeting out yeah I'd love to have my team carry me for 20 minutes to inflate a car early action and yes you know you really do need to stack up the AP. To have that big threat but I always love the players that can really utilize the cage well cuz it's such a big c seat and you either need to have the skill indicator on it because the center is the center of the cage where you cast it but you need to be able to cast it with the edges touching people so you have the skill indicator on or just put enough games in on the champion that you've get the feel for the exact range and you can really see that on stage take effect you know when these guys are popping up the new high-end tents moments with big are cages actually land right on people without having them walk into it absolutely it's going to be a big thing that's why I always have a smartcast and Emmanuel Caskey buying that I just you know pop that out if needed and change between games as I was talking about Spice from all chat I think my all-time favorite one so far is Jensen go to licorice got benched I guess you come full circle now which I really enjoyed throwback to watch 2018 Cloud 9 or ring when the whole roster moves around to keep to the whole story where was the one coming up motivation time I guess sweeties on the roster has a low came in and they traded smoothie away to Echo Fox I believe and it went on from there and that's what is on TSM Azazel still starts for Cloud9 sneaky Nesta Cooper back meanwhile gentleness swap teams over to the opponents now the guy on stage here right on camera is Misty trying to play against Jensen who he has replaced for Cloud 9 a lot of people were super word possibly going to replace Jensen who was definitely an All-Star for them in the mid lane Hughes performer at the international turn especially but I really think that miss me even though he didn't have the star power when he came in has delivered a lot of the things that this Cloud 9 team needed and I was very versatile player and showing it once again here on stage with the Veigar yeah one of those early on in his career on scene I've ever talked about trying to make them more selfish player to have him more of a player ask for Gangsta filling the shoes of Jensen in a more specific away the types of things that he would do to play more aggressively actually thought he's Ripper I was pretty solid I thought his I think was the Arsenal game looks really good I think he got to steal kill and capture them I was like really impressive as well so I think he has been getting a lot better and then I am very sweet of dope to keep seeing this keep like the app people are even making the one behind jokes because everybody else on the team was really struggling and some of the games that are losing this keep fighting his heart out looks like they might have solved some of some of the issues that lead hits at least look happier so that's good that's definitely a good thing in good spirits hear it for the cloud nine sides up getting some Reddy's in chat that's good. Lower case r then some other types are going to print these Eddie the game client and everyone is safe and car and came resume 42 and 1 and some of those ripples through replacement there in space and then react alright let's see some more sense can space then maybe on one of these
as we heard from the flag last coach though they think they can actually take advantage of him being new onto the team Austin X it does take a while for the jugular to really coordinate well especially in the early game with the leaner so far though take out a realtor irelia here what's a z r what I do want to point out as we go through this and that we are still on patch 9.12 and other we don't have the bands in the spring or car are the other two bands hear Center, Pandora back on Fox 1 final band for them it will continue on forward but as I said 9.12 to the patch for now as we have this overlay back in because the band once again next week will be 913 my understanding was that was not to allow the fumes were starting to be disadvantaged coming in the next week and never got to scream G2 and fnatic & Co and not lose any time with that so much like it and that means sidhwani pretty much a hundred percent presents I believe so band out once again not any sort of at Target Banning there or you meet is left up in exchange for the atrox Bustelo probably going to try and take this one this could be a Mike young pic though definitely has played it in the jungle that's going to be tonight Highway Silver plus you owe me a very coming botland combo and that was going to be gone if they want to live in Champion for hot gold Luxe is still available if you want to grab before the second band phase and now it's like Western dude want to grab Israel does goes Super well with you means to have a very safe a hypo damage Lane you can also do things more aggressively like the Lucian try and get in there loosens pretty good since forever regardless combo Justice cells during the open up from their Corky probably the Midland so magic damage beer already picked up for Playa Quest physical damage range carry on crowd control Midland often brings back before he does not directly engage think either with the ultimate you can have three hits mares but generally feels like it's going to they're going to need some sort of Frontline here you know what is basically the only school so far from so they might have viper on the top side and bring something with a little bit more ccrp an initiator Autos is great for starting things up for a fox shocks needs is something to actually start the fight and then it's such a big deal with you all getting recess and silver speed the case here we maybe see some like beerus or even asked would be weird but would be engaged the bottom line for Turtles Bibles look like what does put through or Viper is indeed on a tank here really popular in could have been a possibility here for Phoenix either way if I could it need a jongleur base for a charge is going to drag his band is decent Nautilus almost certainly is 244 hot to go out here we're seeing still a Tijeras band away from wild turtle there's the other dimensional Partners list for you to be taken down I mean I have seen some people do Caitlin with it just for are super annoying a bushing early Lane Caitlin can put them under Tower and then you can fire off constant harassment Longview to place a good model of Swift long as you can track the opposing Jungle of the Dragon release both gone there was a need a lot of magic damage jungle option fourth Magic Image from Store Phoenix as a result from Powhatan popular various place in the world not a crazy town of North America but also a good kick if you are worried about magic damage your composition I do like things every mind there you go with the charge for with silver they've got a very heavy dive composition hair super speed boots. Let's all and everyone just charges in it to try and take down flag play the game plan for Echo Fox a very clear from Champion Select we shall see what the answer here from flyquest is are they going to get Viper some sort of split or they going to actually try and bring a little bit more consistently for their team fight this is going to be locked in at this point that's almost assuredly a top laner here and I was supposed to get another. AP unreliable engaged though is all that you have to try to get a plane can you have to land the rest before they flashed away is dial be locked in a long time it's a wild turtle is the physical damage on this roster that will scale well but there's really no tank on the team's yeah they're relying on pure damage and some stunts from Kenan and Rex die and that is going to be the game plan seems like this do need to get early advantages and keep up the pressure on those turrets Phoenix bringing back the Cassiopeia he reverses Porky and end this again. How hard it is for Blacklist to engage got to be a love's not getting jumped on throwing my ass after you run a few composition of Ken and Rec side so this feels like a good pic of based on opposing team magic damage anyway we have seen Phoenix put on some great Casio games before and I look at the boxes draft all right there sitting up to with Mike Young on a very powerful early-game Champion here in the Olaf what 2 + 1 games with Academy when that deal don't have to worry about the knock UPS could be very very strong Mike Young's debut back in the LCS last we saw him on this stage was with TS them but they famously had a disappointing previous year after dropping him at got a lot better but let's see what happens now going forward I'm getting ready to go onto stage go fees you told me to reverse that they are faced from 2019 summer so far I think it's possible do these teams do look very good they both paid mine again but what do you delete your recent addition to black bus was finally eligible last week for they did last week of regular-season back to play two weeks ago didn't pick up winds but I still think they're very good player and it will be for momentum ever fly Quest meccafox hoping that would Mike young they can do this and we are on around for the last game of the first round robin of LCS 2019 summer all right I should initially also be on the Olaf ear Mite yeah you definitely have a strong invade for Echo Fox but it could try and get a zebra War down themes of spreading out just to look for defense of vision at the moment but you definitely always have to worry about that possibility looks like we had a little bit of exchange and do belter + what deed come out with a little damage dealt to Phoenix keeps around the brush no one's in there and just find a jump around and press that you back and forth 11 Gold for that spell thieves prox for what do you eat on Phoenix as well so a little bit of extra change meanwhile we might have a delayed and they try to utilize that Olaf names like what leading the way q but not going to get away by running for Jack to the wild turtle hold his nerve and aggressive towards spotted out by flight question now do know the 10:00 Central be spotted when he does his Raptors all right let's see if the bottom side actually fake leashes for santorin or if they just show in lane and let echo-fox know they start on the top side looks like they are delaying a little bit not using any any extra man on the Red Bluff or anything though so should be fairly well aware Center starting the Wolves though never understand not on a bus right away but just make sure he's completely unseen the very first game of the game cuz he knows that no one. This far down once I see him on the street towards though if he does go to Raptors they will if they check know exactly path you have taken by grabbing one camp out of off on it it looks like you managed to bypass the whole thing so santorin pretty wisely gets around the jungle house getting spotted they can guess that it was supposed to read but they don't know for sure yeah that's what's a big things yes the Deep Ward was put down by Echo Fox turtle is there and they saw the location of that warts of santorin working around known information are not trying to give over location yet and that opens up possibilities for making a move on the bottom side of the map that's like the more common we would have been like blue to drop to you to look at topside so theoretically still has to play safe knowing that they never saw a Raptor Center is at bottom sides maybe he's up there an early on in the atrox can a match of it does make the a fox has two speeds some CS early on Viber you can see a little bit of harassment down onto solo slowly pushing the wave into the turret can try to get some early damage a lot of the early Canon Power does come from some very damaged and trying to get money off plates and we can get right here it is going to be doing even as much rest as possible for the landing phase Ron but this wave going to crash pretty soon and sadly for them it won't be with a jungle in here by its and let them get there faster if it's possible that you can crash with the wave but I'm usually pretty tight guys going to do the full clear power clear on Olaf pretty common get the level for extremely quick and you also get the benefit of responding your Camp extremely quickly so you can try and get to that level six point thank him now slipping into the river and we does the Santorum pick up the Scuttle crab change a little bit of you a little bit of knowledge at the rec size on top but still has to swing under Tower anyway I don't believe Mike was founded by these got to walk him over so technically the Olaf wasn't spotted that you do definitely no sense for when to stop swaddling walk back of the Jungle south side of that and yeah he's going to be just fine point assorted you mentioned Kobe bought land is shoved it looks like really almost nothing is denied any gas will go over the lane matchups year for flyquest they want to have these early pushing Lanes a lot of this game does hinge on he knows been getting a lot of extra advantages with the wreck site coming through to try and support some of these they really need to try and get the information on Mike Young's where about is that Olaf can turn everything around on one of these overextended solo Lanes especially yeah cuz they are and you chased them down forever even flashes built-in floaties probably still die and he's gone back for an early red might as well so even with the time spent to recall my son basement level on Farm overall against Centaurus and wants to make his own recall very soon and it's so far been treading water across these two jugglers and if we look at the Keystone Seas chosen to Mike down with the Conqueror is looking to be more of the carry style jongleur right sometimes Osceola Osco for predator for those big impact logangster snowball Lane but with the Conqueror you can actually stacked up extremely quickly this is what Top Lane Olaf players take Taco going for a gank right now though he knows valkyrae always get away from the anchor Taco doesn't even passed it right there that was a bit I guess lucky that since when was totaled in in nearby the champion get away. Just came up with propane there he actually is able to see the controller for hot glue sticks around to defend his placement for a little bit then throw in the summer I feel safe and without new timer has gone we are finding drop this one out like young now knowing that recognize me wrong side of Mac it's time to put a quick drink at Ward down up for that crop in the black white and there's no one of my guests were talking about for the New Orleans trying to do I have an impact bits to get time to do is just hit that with the axe not Landing there's no going to be had Real by they talked a little room to ensure that he can get the cannon mini last hit there at least I guess without some extra harassment from the Kenan who is starting doran's blade but definitely expect a Viper twit least go half and half as far as the AP trying to bring a little bit more of that snow for the later stages of the game I'm playing a game for example you play blade on it is actually always wrong if you build it for losing match if you lose your matches anyway why not build a better team fighting item in his GoPro do belts haha and have them and have the better team fiber car has been kind of compelling idea and I'm kind of curious now watching through the games that Europe has better topping his overall and so usually good advice if it's winter and I will see if he actually takes that advice Santo are going to stick around for Scuttle crab number to as it does spawn here what's so far so good for the farming got a fairly calm early game between the squad wild turtle and would need getting some folk out big fight. Revival to get to the cyst it's just a trait of cool guns do damage going back and forth like that they can both feel really comfortable as life accuse pushing guys think that ultimate trade super Advanced stages for fiber here you might not have to use the teleport to get back to Lane in which case you could use the telephone for the bottom side play currently echo-fox going for the hard invade iJustine exchange on topside Mike Young's does move in with a bottom lace steal away the red bug that's pretty nice right there also want to point out that Cyprus cooldown is 30 second shorter than solos so even if it's nothing but spreading water is going to be a 30-second window where is got something else wrong but not rolled under plus he has to be super careful. Solo does it have any Vision on stand for in and the current plate is about to go down survivors about the cash in NY Erica Fox making another power play on the bottom side of the map Mike young starts at the dragon and they're looking for their first objective I got a silver Nautilus really early on and has gone pretty well so far, quick relief Cloud Drake which is actually pretty big four season is mostly walking at you keep in mind that several off and
desired matchup driving right in Champions like to watch the bands come up for Phase 1 delete Draven hit in the band table will be interesting again to see how these ban phases evolve with a the swapping lineup so I do think that the Thalia band was in pots thrown at blabber jungle was it thing for a long time I'm so afraid of something like the Thalia Pantheon let me leave update progress painting about I would expect a higher likelihood of a kill bottom bottom land and things like that so I whenever you have a substitute player you look for more comfortable Champion I think the champion comfortability and the style of champagne is more important than what Lane you're inor whether you're Elena or jungler finishing out the band's phase Aralia Edge warranty for the side of origin sitting on the Pike in the Ravens still for cloud nine as they work out that third and final Fannin will be so the Connor is still available if I want to grab that one up Cloud 9 cuz then book to trade it for you need to pending a priority both teams have but it was very strong and the current meta Origin client guarantee both choosing to remove one of those global pick Champions that we know many teams have a favorite so far in this moment I am thinking a treetop if it happened or not I hear it I feel it still pressuring you know most played Champions he's got such a history on time can she was a really big fart even when he was in on TSM in North America take one of the biggest ones with the shorter range on the level 6 ultimate so you don't get quite as much Matt Mobility early on Fielding Hill and then the the Sun is going down to the bottom Lane you can still take the terror attack in your third ticket for phase one end because they're probably not going to let me know that's true right now you're kind of looking at it for Texas something, like we going to spend staring like to play on the regular season and they do have that option unless it is that Cobalt Lane job and Leona one of my favorite go-to and other things as well very powerful very simple Champion so that could even be something they give to bladder and bottom line is very real possibility something that you were buried alive stuff like between mid top and thought you weren't expected to be bought but in Big Spring or the soda and the players will fill the positions are listed in Traver will be piloting they are. Are they real sue the town of why I can't place it yesterday when Patrick played the Nico sorry I just keep thinking about being in the pot Lane and therefore attributing it to Patrick but as well as dear as a final band for Cloud 9 just do it origin origin like right now is a d or just something a little bit more I like the band coming up from Cloud 9 and XD I think it's just very strong and safe for crab is female to pick into a truck stop here now remember that rise is reworked on the turnpike you have some small changes made the song visibility is just yet the origin I'm decided they will look into Camille so I'm a little bit more of that carries in his stall he was walking about three strong early game Jungle by the ultimate Beto's where they actually going into the South Plains Al possibly in the jungle get the visit the sidelines with Camille and Nico are splitting a bit that wouldn't be the case here we've also had a lot of Camille midlane to sew in your lane matchups North America Challenger they have a lot of possible Camille midnight meal is an answer but it is in fact going to go into the midline but usually they primarily played it with a and they believe it to be true is what makes the pic strong listening they also value is the ultimate combined with Sona is very well give you a very powerful mini games by really good at getting a Camille's going early Camille mid cycle for store trays but the real threat comes from when your jungler is able to arrive by Camille hookshot means that is guaranteed engaged and with the change it to a man unless you get the kill those definitely are viable targets and go all in on and I think Sona Tom kench it's surprisingly strong but it came to still be about Lane at Conrad's while you're going to lose priority Canon D penny on Westfield you choose to do I think and also very the match it okay if I think it's possible. I think the biggest variability will be in the mid to burst into flames vs what will, and try to do in terms of answer was that the teams have loaded onto the rift so we're going to toss it out to the casters for the call thank you very much. We are here to witness origin vs. Cloud9 here in day 2 of Rift Rivals 2019 and we've got a roll of bills in and takes over mid top black horse play me Carrie subbing in as a traditional jungler instead of the atrox up against the Camille So getting counter picks in that matchup although he's running the night for a little bit extra trading power but I think it's going to be super important because when origin play this Camille mid it's not about beating you and laying or going for the one who won usually it's all about controlling the river and having Superior to vs. too well we're going to hear a word from cloud Nine's coach himself rib take it away thank you very much gentlemen I am joined by Reaper Reaper Victory on the horizon how's the team feel any looked all smiles on the stage it's been fun to a drafting with of lover and you know if we don't know what we are doing and how they know we are doing you know absolutely and what was the strategy that bottle and not really be just prepping what am I looking good and who you want good luck in the match up and bring it back to you guys to see how it goes and I will say I think it's actually pretty reasonable putting this Beyonce play style of something he can kind of get to and see that are basically G2 who who wants to play the shape he said yeah you do whatever you want just one more out of necessity then opportunity but it is what it is and who knows maybe we'll see five out of the winning bot Lane after the first time in several years and it might look good Superluv sneaky an amazing player but I had to make the joke all right well trading in the bottom lady as soon as I'm pants vs. silver, I do expect there to be winning this overall you can pretty reliably spell Fieldstone a Q and get Mana back for that keep looking really good damage to your I mean Patrick getting slapped oh yeah but she's mine has a manifold can get that's insane back-to-back games like this it was never about your HP bar is strictly about the mantis well yes and if you got a lot of good to lay down on for Patrick Patrick can sustain on through and it supposed to be relatively low on that manifold so I'll have to wait before you can throw out too many more updates boomerangs actually I'm not going to get into the zoo close to the trip but a nice and power Tuesday to get damaged his hat-trick putting him quite low Nicki almost done. Miffy pushed away though and we can kind of you just have to farm keep my zipper is essentially to get against Tom kench right now is so 18 to 9 is that scoreline I do that mental flip on the scoreboard are losing pressure on bottom light off and mid going very well because Ben Stern showed himself all the way down bottom in that River gives room for Cold Steel away these wraps are still has the shell crab in to camp on the topside at welcome to quite a Head of the Class can solve well doesn't take any sweet spots in from bladder size 7w backwards as well and as a decent trade Farm do pretty close to equal if we do have the players now swapped you can see the match up there as Midland first round is 40 closed Spencer and seeing what happened just yet early early TV Patrick does have frosting that's the important Powers bike to get to.. Items and now we say bling if I guess you can do back in teleport in as well, but don't Mana pool now it's basically just depending on the jungle pressure who's going to go to is nearest because it is very risky especially for camping like straightforward with her hookshot Realty Wong's in town that you really game was damaged there and I absolutely love this key Rush Executioner's calling first back that is the earliest who's I've literally ever seen in Pro play against double healer I love it I need to be very very effective it will help the trades a lot keep mind that this is a very poke be laying out like you always do this if you're playing like a liones of her kind of thing where you like trying to burst or all at once but you got poked her so constantly that you're going to make Headway through her W with that you're going to have the greatest wooden stick for 3 seconds which can sometimes affect the time catch thick skin if it takes down in time you'll get a couple of those pics have though a different lot of value their most impactful Persona is trying to smash that W key and waste a lot of her man afford those types of the same trait up in that matchup I do also think that it was a game has been relatively quiet so far this is once again a game that is going to sort explode around that level six Marcos because of the camile's ability to hit level six and then look for Rome plays around the map as opposed to very aggressive junglers Champions will be looking to get a little bit Scrappy come come you know five minutes in the game I'm still at the early jungle Ledo has gone the wreck site you mentioned earlier on Spencer and showed in bought Lena being seen the Raptors taken if not more so it is a good early start for cold a topping within 3 CS midlane within 2 bot Lane as a mention of course a small lead expected thing that you are against Sona overall means the game is slightly in Origins favor Leon and looking forward you know projecting 10 15 20 minutes into this game Who these team comps I think that on the side of C90 of a really strong team by both the ability to initiate with the movement speed of this, and the silver but also just reliable primary initiation with the Jarvan You lyric ending up on top of that as well just very straightforward how do you nine want to execute in the Spy versus spy words for origin they don't have that primary initiation tool yes Camille can go in but she's going to be a little bit more squishy than you go to will have to find it very good ultimate it's much harder to execute origin origin Spivey 5 when they are in an even number team fight and we are having cold reconnect to the game a little bit I was him who pause and he will be returning soon enough and will hopefully get everything sorted out quickly but that is what's going on right now and we get that all fixed up shouldn't be too big an issue and he's in his own jungle so we know nothing to really stop him regardless I think it'll be pretty big certainly we tend to see a Pinochle ending else similar for AP candidate is glacial augment Nico which is going to be kind of exciting as you're going to be like the double bit spooky ghost and glp build and and that will find Waze in anything that's how they look to start a fight if we don't have to fully commit with any spells or our bodies Camille throwing herself into The Fray and said they can use the key goes to get
Viper G2 they have a lot of confidence Galaxy brain right there Nico is banned away from Wonder flat there's one else on the team calling for 14 which which side was draft early game over the LEC good early game setup for a Smithy out of the Jungle 14 what do the painted following early on a fix for them but wait to see what the first for the last bands going to be the end of the first pic but I feel like I'm almost every North American team for it aloud, what you perceive that but, he's never allowed so that's never really smile band Ford Taurus thing okay to take one that seems like the obvious choice br40 which lane is going to be so far without try the challenge because obviously off what was not the best player on G2 we learned that one yesterday maybe say maybe I don't know we haven't seen it yet but I know last year a lot of practicing until you actually play it so my default it puts him at his best off of just put them in the game right now maybe you need to realize that you will like wood going for sure I think this I would still take severe myself play barely stand up and away we haven't seen any other do you have a very unhappy but it is scale and getting Eduardo second band plays there at the rally off the table that's worse when you are playing at before they become position flights going to Tara can you plug a tank junglers you do need some kind of hyper carry or least drawn Lake infratel swear to support I really would you want to talk you know there's some kind of early on Instagram but we could sense if you think that was fake going down into the bottom line. You want to go way back to North American fans hopes to an income statement so keep your eyes on that one special I believe back in the day help them get into the jungle that was a very good one wasn't sure Route 42 plain a million assassin guessing's at top of this point as the overall match of the bed top with t f in the middle and I think you don't blame me because of what you need to become a centralized get some more useful so I'm the map if they want to unpack this Donuts in your early game we saw that it's Nico busted yesterday be very very powerful makes your queue is good. It's actually so toxic ultimate Seek and Destroy competition from juice to kind of crazy place like that stuff is not that strong with maybe I eat my words c l need a top or mid laner most likely top of impact and it's actually I don't know exactly what I want to talk a lot of smelly a fathom on that stage Lonnie but I just want to wait I don't know what you two are doing over here give me 8 more seconds and then tell me where it's going I think it's actually Savannah by the way that's my prediction so where is everything going on TV support jungle and then I think it's going to be a pretty invisible invisibility text and then falling heavily aggressive very limited not that great either free 6 in his own farm and imported a right at the very beginning so that's going to be but I feel like every single length but I'm guessing who's helping especially early on because Savannah has no right way to escape from this life it is a very easy for US 52 path of topside early intervention shut down one well I think I think it was your surprise than this one what's the weather in North Bergen help against the LEC the respective provenza right here as in the game and to get to know a price on this amazing wonderful be too drafty Holly standing by with brass for an interview because I am here with grabs grabs you said yesterday that you were disappointed to see this so natarica come out from C9 so you're seeing it again today what was the reaction I bought them but yeah I think you meant to spice a company have to give him a chance before so that's what was the inspiration behind this cop was this just a spur-of-the-moment so you can use that for something that you practice a bit. I think if I give me a quick percentage chance with any chances of taking this game I'm in the dark on 50 50 50 50 Lovett they see the hell is great so that's the draft yeah that's way better than so I like increasing odds I would certainly lose a lot of help and TripIt of Mana taking this stuff by himself. No problem was in the group Next that'll be fine for him CF very early bag of gold going to feel good I get my clothes for a few days early trading Jensen Hugo sotil Lane by Lane and try to figure out what this Jeep new Compass trying to accomplish. I think that's relatively easily with this Dona Champions that even in midlane as a melee champ has really good Wayne presents because of the way you can use his shadow to extend the range of a shuriken you can land a fair amount of hope so I think once this lane hit you with the human Q to set up with Lil and sort of guarantee this hurricane they can maybe try it out attrition but that's always be really hard against the Sonic R what was the score today for keeping my NCL does have to he was in the landfill minor you be both never going to make Headway here in this matchup take me. Without issues there and go looking to be earned it does feel like I'm looking at a very early lights don't come by here in this one maybe I won't be far behind either he's playing it pretty well toppling match up pretty equal right now to want to go to push it has to be some damage yeah not Trey is going to be difficult impact doesn't have a ton of health regen right now belong on the door and shield in the ocean and I'll midline or tea out of potions been good around by Jensen is the ward outboard going to find the key for the slow can he juked the queue it was the flash nicely done by caps no fly for the first Mickey out he ghosts they have to lose the flash been how was Wings in a really awkward position to Smith and just stick around here because there's no flash on cap for the 4th of caps bring towards that top side of the river knowing Yang cosas very likely on the top side of the map and you'll probably wait another minute or two before looking for a tournament I got to wait for up and down to the bottom Lane 24th PS4 the terratone Leif Wells with his best when he is a very good starting late night stand it if they trade back with a gherkin not going to want to damage and yeah this is going very well for Tea Leaf Lane sonidera not this time I walked by this Ward what are the benefits of the sudden the bottom line is that he doesn't rely on Amana so in terms of overall system HP why is doublelift and Corte De can try to build up their health. They will be lowering their Mana over the course of the longer they do stay at length before teleport first can BB will try and wheedle downstage pbar slowly burn through the man as well and then look for knowlen and they just a little bit of rice are you actually walk through like he was walking towards the bottom land after his office cuddle Circle then turned up in the jungle with a drink at work to you or he knows he's gone that way they think it out and I stream it. That's good damage at cor nothing to run out of Mana biscuit is it was already picked up by the wreck on a person just a safe and make you can just take that off and hop back in the drop-down this Ward and Smith evening for a fact they can look to fully reset this wave now is Laura man of ours doublelift and chords to us I hate sure can still put the Champions across that one cute so big hit their it's really rough 40 elderly on all three lanes from G to have pressuring you mention of it in the draft that one Jersey doesn't give him that percent max HP damage on it so he can work through the how far of impact does the Conqueror to do so stealing much further into the cycling one who's going to have a pretty sizable Advantage actually really interesting to see him bring out the Wonder is a player that we know love to prep crazy stuff for toppling you like to call him the seven wonders of the LEC he had seven super unique Champions prep for MSI we saw at the Pike I believe the main as well just wanna maybe one of those suits with always exciting to see what he tries to bring us to the one of the ghost bar goes away we get to see of Utah planes reset coming through Kindle jamming along for their for wonder which could be decent of Black Cleaver if nothing else I'm going to see Savannah to hard reset and go towards Catalyst that looks like either Bissell Matt probably not Rod of Ages of the great feeling that good so I can take up some lunch at the bottom Lane TP was not used by either bought land on their way back in TV through DirecTV support because you bring her with you and you instantly come back in Boston December on a slow pushing away from TL Taurus G2 But first you can see how helpful he feels playing up and not really afraid of getting harassed gold just about dead even there between doublelift and perks and now support the game where you look to see I think you do try to explode across the map yank those level 5 hearing level 6 caps has his Destiny as well so we can listen to roam around the map so once yank those pics over to that level six and gets that from itself what you should get after finishing the blue box take a look to make a plate or mid lane big item going to him for sweat spell books at the heliport now we got the upgraded sights do now for him as he gets closer to the actual upgrade coming through just $298 short so far nicer Democrats vs. Yankees around the wing and this could be a slow into the attempt to charm you can see it as well for between the bot Lane Flats so much damage what a wonderful day for the quite as well as at 5 p.m. right back out for me as well boards the back end of that deal just didn't have to sustain damage to go against you
which is unlike Ender wiggin is really my point here I know neither Target bands on specific number Champion Carrie out of the pool strong Lane as well they don't want to have to deal with that what's great is that moments ago everyone looks dead serious we have the biggest group of unqualified try hard right now we have Young Buck coaching Cyrus looking at some Susie Astic a zephyr in charge of the pig and bath is really getting both still in the draft and they throw out too bad he is officially it's awful lot they are trying to really put on spotless show me to Toby medical saying in the pre the pre are the three main lobby rather that out of siding is what we'll see what Medics hours and hours of TSC practice yeah it's really simple couple time songs for broken hearts call Lanta bus is the fishes die right here we go was a very solid tire flat he's very aggressive and like I would plan Achmed now dromebox I think that'll be that strap the thing I'm concerned about it also. Roaming in a bathtub The Bishop's he doesn't do well alone he's a follow-up not only but weirdly leading origin so strange but you know that's fine professional manager and his personal time professional followers All rights ever taken away Nico taken away so they realized they have no idea why did just like insane and it's very very good at the gastro but more bad stuff out of there with a freighter is there is a very nice that's the thing great. Thanks based on who is playing as rione karma, Midland Sport & Spine Reginald exact words yesterday when he ran into the Hall where it what the hell is good anymore pharmacy at Roscoe do you talk about wind conditions is there any is that if we want to get the most kills and I'm going to I think he's going to try to escape afterwards investment as well he will try to set up on the stage and it will not go well yeah but you got to think Young Medicare later the potential to be embarrassed you looking me straight in the eyes Viva slots is a hot debate like everyone's feeling positive that's good that's the last time you use Waze with the tires are there we go far into the game versus EU Blue Sky surely I have the song to level one. Close open Spotify David okay what's the time now we're stopping summoner's Tales come on I quietly unlucky bit of a difficult start there for the NAC I commit a lot of resources there I think all that you've answered sincerely happy that also I did not. I definitely felt like you deserved you at her early game II invade I don't know if Matt is going to be prepared for this is sitting on the wall Brian now oh no we found the weak link guys Drake's awaken by Eminem Kobe Bryant Packers winning right now that doesn't mean it's original is on the, he is young but come on you're the only hope now for Europe we're 2 minutes into the game it's time to make sweet potato pie recipe that's it play around topside no flash turn off we were supposed to be Play 311 Spa more facts and fight against each other potential support against like I don't want to like this is how it's going to go first exhibition for playing the Giga toxic Domino ain't get the timer honestly understand when it comes from the random teleport from diarrhea stop playing and then like we have TP advantage and when you said early I mean, Young Buck The Last Hope for your teeth 400 ounce rate great romance morning quiz what is Ender in a kind of breakfast is over but the legendary sidhwani Olaf tank will have to wait cladribine Cody right now getting out Jungle by medicine only aggressive then why would that be cool down. Then the route that Becky Lynch Q to the first game as well NH coming back now on the map that extended the Golden Globe at nearly a thousand at off the back of diarist he's putting it on early deficit but this is his homegrown handle the situation and you find a way back at all. How is he so far behind in Galt California girl bounty to start the game out so that is going to do a lot of heavy lifting their slowly realizing that his time is it going to end up sick so they have strong hold it and I mean I don't know how to tell you this but it does require cloudy Kobe's on the level leads to control work what mechanics medical was sometimes difficult for him so impressed with stuff professional skills in order
are tough opponents and who is Rumble has been dropped off first fan right off of the table, the following two very quickly from mentioning the 9:12 bus but they were ginormous Jewish hat so much speed to the team now a toxin Aralia very common as far as our Flex pick power pick that are left with the Silas taken off of that list, and I've had one game on it but definitely priority greatly reduced as well I'm not too surprised you've gone from Pro play so what you want is fine but maybe he'll be a vital check in a cell look you don't say those words for us to be clear a fairly was going to sign up for the tank fish tank do to you if such wondrous trundlewhen we have our third spacing 21st pick as you me a band all right is this is Ronnie Dyson care enough about it they can take a later on honestly there are other good options to get better right now but it's going to be all about how she missed would want to play right I mean double it doesn't seem like they greatly enjoyed their sonidera games do they were effective sure everyone is a shock but I like the Pikachu face when I get to going through I want to see I want to see freaks version of the Pikachu face I'll take a picture of it and a lot of other sports coming in what does carnivore lira is on the table so there's the junk pick up no trundle I mean it is a galactic Vince Carter though is another yo very viable option vs. Edge Winery right there another one of those frontliners did you get that pic priority you can use it on the Tom can't because there is a Time catch on the team obviously you're going to have to watch out for whoever he's close by for the devourers but the very viable Target as well a lot of the times you can actually first him down before he gets out of the ultimate son inches thick skin and I'm going to probably reconnect you at this pretty early on after has upgraded sights Stone and I'll be the first Pit Stop easy answer seems like a very quintessential Cody Sun Vulcan laying here Cody son likes to be a huge damage Source later in the game 14-5 play Aziz bed Elaine face can be so oppressive Stoner Tom Kent as very very little to chill with left findings be spanned out and the long-range ratman from Caitlin I wonder if it's even going to be difficult going for klepto products for the Sona in exchange for you know the hell that you're going to have to use for it if you don't have the extra killing of the carrots before eating it this time around we have seen things like coins don't have either the Farm Lane there where are you know you going to go to CVS you just take the coin you get the gold that drops when the things you do you know when you don't kill and make your way up from there what is the rare build games like and Camille the bands for clutch his side he was going to move a lot of toppling often as he looking for a two bands that made the Twisted Fate and LeBlanc argan oil does lime pickles beer instead Clutch Gaming are going really good late-game here with us dear Caitlin wachs lots of long-range for later I think they're going to put her knee on a tank I am definitely feeling a tank draft if you have two tanks in front of this type of backline. It will be a very potent team fight the other end of course yes I did try and answer but it looks like this might be the case chase them poking long-range answered here with Team Liquid that could go to the mid lane by the way for Denton Jake Jace was one of the old pics that people use into a deer trying Pokemon early to get early lethality these have Rovers that might come into question or you can go for heavy Tok of course you can look at things like midlane is a collie will be grabbed play for himself either roll right now so typically impact has been there Jays player for Team Liquid I believe all of their LPS games have been in that order but they could fall a switch-a-roo year what will the answer be if they do expect impact to be taking the days once again we have our second LCS eyelid after the huge rounds of nurse really hitting the wave clear as well as delaying the shields than she have to land your stun on the Chain start using in The Jungle by the way as another option but we'll see how how many does up first of the chase sports game definitely missing one right here I do like texture effects of coffee you mentioned are very very good lately with your peeling back when I agreed very strong I like how easy is it to Segway your early game leave it you expect to have from the duel and a bottle and move around the map in the mid game you not going to the truck down with the Caitlin bucks each and then by the time he or a bunch of caught up you've got a cotton clothes at 3 a.m. is your point and it really does transition pretty nicely have plenty of Carrie Tupa forth with this phone of the adjacent is top as you mention the akali is mid and they're going to get a lot of healing healing and helps in the Tom kench to take the front line for the team liquid size and that Tom Kent told me to want to hear Justice write a reflective side so I might be a little more difficult for them to see how they can play through their bottom line for me here all right Team Liquid heading towards MSI crafted their own win streak looking to enter strong the Clutch Gaming coming in from the bottom of the standings off the back of some strong Cody Sun reliability and hooneys gameplay improving and we are going to be on to the rift Team Liquid your first place team I'm cutting my losses and 3:40 that is that's rough is not how I feel about this seemed all right well they're going for the in bed right now this is I believe we had to stack Team Liquid to are they just kill the warden back out no face check there money comes across lots of players I don't know what the five-man board XP if it's enough that to be a little too I've only seen it with three I know that you can definitely get it with three I think he even for but 5 might be stretching corned Ox down a zombie Ward rooms at work later won Gold chords AJ smashing the Botley matchup that's not true Vulcan 215 from hitting selfies and it is to spell tease for double if so he's going for those Autos kleptos felonies as usual even without the extra killing from the tereck got the Tom kench there in case you call Lynn happen yeah Tom kench looking to eat doublelift out of Finding Dory doesn't get hit with the infamous trapfinding combination that's very scary but also for late-game does Tom Kenny die in favor of denying skarner open it and so it's mainly an adaptation there instead of the classic Sonet Eric minions go down going to be none missed actually pretty son has all of them Elohim I talked to you last with the words you mind if I can just wanted the scoreboard lies to you but now that Pharmacy lost on the good side of the awesome Ford sunglass crabs one and then wait for the push for some more of this little book for smokin and really game it is ready for today taking all the farm school track how much you can be denied are you like I was going for the poker on the Vulcan less easy for Walking Dead the same as the fleet footwork Caitlin was super long range I feel like you know you got an extra potion that I agree with damage is definitely going to stick to Stained is it from using it once I almost there now shots and then she actually she was instantly when you play the animation on your own character you don't move right away but he used to block those ones out and stop link my stomach for this when he comes in but doesn't even bigger if I have a good start to this one has big way to farm for that way if there is slow big pokecord today's to level one you barely got out in time to avoid that trap as well walks off the edge First Alert right as usual for a daughter laying here with a Tom Kent and especially so which its long-range assault with Cody Sun involved in Caitlin and Lux is expected to get them early turret played for themselves as well as a large DX lead thing is there honey still falls off a real comes in and impact racing back and Who Knew by the way we had him on countdown last week and he was the one to say yes to Silas thirst no look very big on paper but he felt like it was still very much a viable left yet and competitive Champion but now we get to see him actually prove it right I love when we have to do to get to see the players put up that was getting ganked and that's going to be drinking out of the way taking very little damage actually doesn't even need to deal with anymore after that one yeah yeah that is from East J by the way I just tagged at 1 and up and goes control 7 Altura Road crank? For sure love it I do not have the 2016 Pro it is what is unforced to drop some Farm you have to imagine Caitlin should drop pretty much is 0 Across The Landing phase so far slowly work their way for $0.30 300 gold up from all that but pretty decent gold on the Sona here as Vulcan runs over the first room across the map with a brief forward trinket were two of them actually does the time that you would thank us so now we're going to start tracking xmithie here I like that kind of move should make me feel very safe in the bottling they see him up by the Raptor fit so it should be easy to track noise. Satellite else to do on the map except for spend some time passing by the amount another word that means lyric knows these clear up on top side but in fact goes for the recall after pushing in he does not grieve for trip play damaged with lyrics whereabouts unknown toppling recess with eight NCS difference there was an exact match to go to do all that much lb come in with the ability power coming in for 280 serrated jerk so done for impact mean you can be quite aggressive he wants to be Rick Morty come through and if I will walk his way back to Lanes with her is a bot Lane fight impact can join it who need cannot and will she probably catch the push in time as well it's very very good times I am packed means that recall losing their bathing Lyra unseen coming in Xfinity fully fully seen by clutch. They had to Ward's a new he was in the area now so there is waiting for the counter let me know he left on the river as well so they're going to push pull or maybe as well and out Goes lyrics recall even have a jumbo Farm Pikachu involves her up do right now is such a giving head larger through the bottomland they've already gotten one place and working towards the second pretty soon damage was that was not going to ask you though but that was running low on manahassett ET but needs to get back usually have math for 2 year for money for a tear by the way sunglass definitely helped out a lot with that so little bit more than usual tarek number and of course very high base attack damage the past has helped as well as hell to fix the damage is done so they were approaching I feel yeah that we need a few choose me I feel like they knew that there was possible danger in that brush cuz they were initially approaching together and then double starts walking in a zigzag there they had award or they have a work back to live at CCM too much maybe a baby be able to take it down GPS to stop the back there but it doesn't register damage in time the Cody Sun not delay that's very big the mountain Drake was actually in this situation is actually dialer the game because it is a Katelyn BGE service in the more you damage them the more the extra armor which tree damage can ignore so strangely impact for the mountain Drake another look at it from the TL side of Vision on that route cute yeah they felt like it was in there was some danger in there but if you do that you have to approach with Tom catch a lot closer Sona is very liable to get in first two down and if the binding hits both if buying for the Tomkins too far away to save doublelift that's what were they were banking on as their safety for stopping this recall that is just dropped the Vulcan Landing the double binding there for them to 100% the Sona and really give the money over to Cody's on this is going to find Infinity Edge progress
in summer it's not been the same if they are actually very heavily on the players as they've all been kind of vocal about how disappointed they are because they expect so many wins for themselves would be too specially though I have to say something and you look very good you know in their game yesterday even though they lost he had a good run did not make a lot of us are probably at is Rutgers game of the year so far he was dealing with the lane where they had ruin on the come Midland with the counter pick and he got focused quite a lot will do we can bounce back in this game is all ready to throw into fans out irelia and a collie off the table on the side of life Quest Karma after the Bluffs in 912 going to be off the table as well so far you me as being left up and we know what's available here as well to be traded Sports we'll see what actually come through another Swan as it isstrong ones who is the queen of the path right now I think almost every single team will be doing the first fix one of my points League of Legends sivir I mean you guys deliver that you got a bunch of the 49er lady attack speed level 140 is always super threatening people always have to keep their eyes out for flyquest on the side of turtle and was just going to be a second LCS game with the squad and already they're locking in the sport event work on one each on four other Champions has been engaged to Linda of the teamand has like an aggregate 80% go to the patient they are doing a lot of work right here I'm going to come through to keep the alliance against Time cast videos of Europe is one of the primary Champion for him so this is definitely going to be a comfort pick as well we should I use fairly effectively in the last game ever was spell shield and Tom can should be buried State rolled right now junglers and bought winners have been grabbed flag that's got first dibs on the most 50% presents in for a flightpoppy dropped off the table here against fake God and his ear drops Mexico Belton they don't want one of those carrots be stopped by a poppy you know it's generally does the split by the way is vipers Riven Jack Van is some restarts I got to say cuz I haven't seen him play it so far this year even on the team has and don't stop playing Jacks and apparently what would counter pick what life wants to play so Hennessey's maybe grab a mid laner first and then we see what life or blind is about the scaling and you know. About I question your lane so maybe they are worried about something that is going to tell them they were on their team with a substantial Frontline already and was that type of Frontline I was probably already looking for 5 quest to feel something off for Viper dinner now for me it is still used infrequently in the jungle I think it is very rare cases where you need to go ball early but Top Lane I think he's still a Powerhouse I honestly think it's an underused Top Lane Champion right now you get your Tiamat early try and get waves clear and then you go turn roaming for gang much like an old junker would accept that you had a farm with experience and pop play money and you get to have the same old powerful when do you want situation and nobody Mobility on the champion here and that we proclaim a view go for a gunblade at the senior one-v-one but it's almost always actually build a car build said he will go on it but it's a rarity nowadays so can induce me on the top when is iftar for you is he here hoping to repeat himself from yesterday's game where was a very very weak performance was counterpick but I think he has a very very strong are they done with the back him up and this could be a pretty good field day for pobelter engaged tools Netflix can be very reliable here as well Flack what does Juanita mean my bad either both of them have ganking often does why he plays Camille in stained red meanwhile trundle is actually an effective ganger with a Victor because wow a victory by himself very good Atlanta and a trundle by combine them pillar plus the gravity field does usually burn a flashed by themselves so it was a very low cool down abilities so could be so kind of surprisingly good combination definitely agree we'll see if it does come through and they can start picking a part sew in the middle anger is not have natural escapes. Two teams near the bottom of the standings of 226 over hundred thieves they put you back in the lineup in subbed out someday as a result and it's been working for them 2 5/2 y + hope you like the trip with the deed now starting at this week could not find the win open it today is the day 8 turns around w a one-week break for these teams regardless as they sit from home and watch Rift Rivals just outside of making it into refer I was just outside of qualifying that you know it's spring playoff team strong performance from them lot of people had super high hopes and I know they did themselves so they're still looking to climb back up the standings with so many teams so close it's very much viable for anything in the entire lead to make playoffs right now if you make a run yep yeah 6 play something to look for in 3 right now this is certainly doable and well within reach next couple of weeks 6% off an interesting enough water does not find the poke on to review at the angle not the range though it's going to be a top side start for both junglers by the way and turn on the red wine has gone with the Talisman so I expect clearing most of the AOE camps down on the bottom side after starting clueless transition and we might even see some bottomley Focus they're generally a Camille Canon matchup Camille actually is very powerful in short trades news so good because of the passive Shield that pops up in the first name as you can get with your cues she would like very short trades where is Kenan any sort of extended interaction is going to be in the favor of Ken and get to abuser Reigns match up against a cat around through the brush dropping minion aggro throwing out constant harassment so early levels especially that is going to mean that by four tries to avoid as much damage as possible and as much interaction as possible I'll just sneak minions what is going to be a conqueror Camille here we do see comments sometimes for the just W trading to make the middle of the lane a little bit easier but is going for the more all in all in actually kill someone so we see the bot Lane trading back and forth between both sides but it is a flak vest with the bush and these walking back here then go has yet to drop NEC Aston that's going to feel pretty nice because you just feel confident going to invade next you have 10 well he's definitely been confident you know in the last week or so if you can 2 weeks and showing up on stage been playing a lot more aggressively than usual see if it holds true on this dire right now again as we mentioned. Cooler starting topside so they're transitioning down bottom and amazing Sports to the party on the ward hit ya swept away with the lightning surge but oh my that is paint with you all live for Cocker freak he's able to project buy a bird hits the sun is the trade their God lives that low HB starting a door and slayed means that he is going to have a much rougher time in this Lane and helps out by for a lot like the ascent touring makes a pass on the top side of the map now because getting a steelhead early would be you do not quite worth Soldier walks back away don't believe he's part of a trundle W but may have and you know we're trying to lay there like I came up on chickens for Santorum though he got both of them pobelter walking into the brush lands the slow yep uses the exhaust that he picked up with the spell thief so do big costume of a natural looking for Sam to the topside do forcing fake other half and they will make him down fake God is gone a solo kill sorry for the jungle I like how you can see Santorum pause there with this is why I knew he was going to give the last Auto over to Viper but I'll take another look at it a Viper doesn't get the sun cuz they got used to the extra speed there but sand Hornets inside route so it doesn't matter he's able to turn him against the wall to get this done and then he get into range the top there but I know that feeling as a jungler or as you get a little bit too Auntie there's no risk and he just use flat iron from what do that was fun but yeah I really liked was when he first came in he actually gave me earlier I'll give a little more space to kill two little minor things actually a difference there since it's when was in range of the Passover Vanderbilt leave now if like was also very good start at 11 CST for Viper who has totes Summoners up has yet to recall though in cash in on the 202 school and Viper really has risen that's why these stars for the else you guys, 45 West North American players making a big big impact on the top Lane playing primarily all these carries Sean Camille now and this is one of the scariest that's very scary as you said if you get ahead early the TM at rush first I am what we talked about in champ select allows you to push that lane and it just makes the enemy jungler life a living hell because Camille can come over the jungle watch for any of the camp at after we destroy you in your own jungle or even make looks towards Midland really want to point out that I purchased before or down when he first he peed and he pushed the wave in the river to staying that he put a trinket or down in the dry brush up there so there's a chance that amazing things that was put sound at think I would get it at that and it might actually start the jungle and get passing look at the bottom side but makes a pass through and they catch a little vision them on the way out in Fort Lee I think the biggest fart About That Bass was this war that they left behind wait a second were you taking some aspects but right here by your red but this is one of the least sacked brush in the entire game which does provide fairly long lasting vision and we'll see if that one does paid some dividends at least it's a good no reward for spending that time going for the cheapest babe I got this money back to the Top by Central actually looking to steal away is red bug has the space for it to report a dead spot trundle if he looped through the bottom Lane jungle and it gives in front of his face you're looking for the show doesn't doesn't need this might have to say grab that gets this deal in a pretty clean I have to leave in the app again trundles far enough away this is a fruity doable dye fake outside what do they do when burned the Eagles to damage across your computer has done but look how taking such a lot of these is not going to Portrait by this permit at all and a very clean Ezekiel the Top Lane yet again for Viper video credits of fibro this time around finishes off the kill for members actually on the map roaming for flyquest they are getting out there for early and make it count alright here's another look at it as we saw the double Rome from a pulled out there and stand for on available may God knows he is going down here there's not a lot he's going to be able to do to outplay that with no support coming from the rest of the team and time so good move from flyquest capitalizing on this pathway power and Camille is Off to the Races now to back up those all in with conqueror so much damage output come through Sheen already you can get it converted a true damage this with a huge butt conquer as well going to come through and she will chase you down individually just spent the money as well as going to feel nice it is gunblade a pecan and as expected here for fake job but it is just a few continually down in money super comes out amazing does infinity War just make sure this has been in but doesn't feel confident enough to gank and feel Flash and Oates up for license I mean Camille is absolutely insanely hard to Fortune
and looking to shred the tanks with trundle now we are in a Champion Select Cloud 9 on the blues * 4 and 3/5 into silver off the table and wait to see what if one does one of First Take he arises not but that's why I already so far this Pat aatrox still is see what else comes up as we very often seen Chaz supports now as well carmelux Yumi all-important they're already targeting the bottom line here with a silver band champion in Pro play instalok you all across the board at all levels of League of Legends right now I take out very quickly it's a super good wave clear Marksman trying to deny that and rednecks in is a champion that has arisen up so so quickly for the Top Lane and use very effectively by CLG yesterday as of what they can do even flopping role basically haven't ruined go mid with that to really capture apply for to sing, band EU meme ban here as well luck still up as the remaining Queen of the support will right now also relia has a high price Soul enter alongside the intervention from before we saw a licorice have a decent at Ali game yesterday in that's okay so they definitely want to trade some of those pics that you're imagining write the atrox and irelia they can get two for one right now with his dad wanted being taken away field you have shown their very confident and just picking a trundle into it as multiple times weekly pick that up but in the first two picked they can grab two of those powerpyx I also would put a high priority on the lock that you mention for bottom line so maybe they split it file process been amazing forest EOG if any of the High Life Light yesterday with the Lux coming up with Dave Midland One difficulty of taking Aurelia and ate rocks together and cutting trundle is your very physical damage heavy so they might be kind of shying away from that a little bit and long one of them to go over to make sure they have a good day images tribution you got the Apostle think that they're not actually yes that one. That one is graviton cast the most highly prized to Port I have to think that they've got some counter for a truck then thinking that they're baiting Cloud 9 into an a talk to make somebody feel she has done historically throughout the entire history of the organization is always leave up powerpyx you know the most contested champion in the current bed and have something prepared to try and counteracting end game to Cloud 9 take one of the two irelia so far and again keep mine doesn't want either physical damage juggler as well since you went for those same to you have the same damage profile issues it's just why you work so insanely well with irelia do like that is one of my favorite combination in all of League of Legends as the Top Lane and jungle combination because they can stand so well off of each other problem as well going to add a little bit more safety here to the D9 Scott and everybody just staying away from the atrox after it's been so dominating such a huge Deep by force only took the Froyo type bonus right now I got plenty of stuff come out of the lineup is there really is going to be. what's going to happen across this past 9.12 was in Chandler heavy Ardent censer meta everyone should run High crit March 10th and it said you got tank Sports on both sides as real as an entree at Marsh minute it's a bit similar to the old versions here as well and he's going to go far farther and farther farther down that the two lists here maybe you'll get Bandit II rotation steel GE easier way they need both are stolen in less time catches Fleck and Cloud 9 need one pillow and also its glacial not really more focused again the Top Lane rumbles been a really North American Focus Champion I feel like I'm looking out across that allows the other we really highly prioritized it's actually our second most hit Top laner does BBQ have quite a few Rumble players and after that one away from licorice I'm frantic down final bands coming through coz the last band of the draft they can also can't keep my dick in a trap from those fellows as well look want dropped off the expect maybe Liquors take the irelia pitching nisky somewhat we are highly prized quite a bit not these you just pee wee Champion syndra is it going to rain moriana as well both those might not want to deal with a loved one to deal with ADD Accents in the mid lane because few weeks generally will play Champions without dashes but we'll have lots of damage and scaling for a big eight p m fight for it okay for my blend stolen going to be required here for CLG that O'Reilly's in one of the two lanes but not which one just yet those missing liquor store that championed just fine they've got a very safe bottom line for themselves so I'd expect you if you need to go aggressive with their picks for the top half of the map and Dave the counter Pick 4 ruin just getting fucked power of evil yeah a generalist made one of his most played Oriana hear the creator of the well at least you're at least the promoter of the nashor's tooth orianna style will they be able to get the four-for-four meal is Right Here Right everyone is going to feel good at once I said you wanted everyone to Pack and Stack up towards that something passes for Lakeridge every chance they get though it has gone for 9 and he has looked amazing on it so I think this might signal akali top and irelia mid of course you still do you know can't move them around at will but licorice is go to for the past few weeks Hispanic Ali it has resulted in back-to-back Cloud 9 losses so I would say not the akalis fault not you know who to licorice know absolutely I think is better than a great player and outperforming member and now it's the algae's turn if they do expect the akali top when it more likely one of the do regardless double melee and games like will come through yet again have see this matchup a lot Gangplank into the melee Champions a little bit easier to attack them with the barrel trading back with the burning damage in the store if they do try to hit you back and ruin is going to be a high damage player and he's got some decent rates are not super reliable for either seen on top laner here and can get kills with that Feller and I would definitely recommend for Gangplank if you're trying to use this type of counterpick going with the grass route to can stack up the health akali still very threatening and once you hit that level 6 as one of the danger points BP will still have to worry about now we are going to take down last 3 seconds give me a call in the top in for liquor if he's going to put of stuff up there that passes can help a little bit knocking down barrels ruined though has been a standout Wiggly especially in can evaporate Spence Karen's defenses with King tribute and subjugate is the one that she still thinks he's a passive it is being fairly similar things my mind is getting a backwards regardless if they get this one five wins in a row they retain control of first it has been an incredible split for them so far Cloud9 know this will be our last stage game before Rift rivals on Thursday they will battle Europe's best and origin and it's going to be exciting if we get ourselves ready to go to the ER as well and find a way this is just our new League of Legends we have a new mode we will wait to hear what exactly is the cause this one but it has been scaring back on stage for the first time this week it was blabber put a couple of games in we heard coach reprints say they wanted to give her some stage time use them as a secret weapon for a secretive for Rift Rivals to make sure that the jungle stop going to happen if you'll good I do always think it is very interesting how most teams will prioritize having the jungle so bright it really does feel like the most valuable role to have a substitute player at because you get to sit back during the games in best-of-five scenarios with the coach discuss your the enemy jungler sprouts and bring in a fresh and clear head for the next game that we were the roles that benefits the most from coming in off of a stickman position because they'll all the lanterns you know it's going to be if you have a substitute later it's mostly about how good are they how well if they perform recently Instagrams the lane matchups aren't any sort of you know big game to game different it's much more you know for the jugglers in decision-making absolutely so a quick word on what happened here we are remaking the game real quick same picks and bans reloading into it apparently an issue with power bills runes are they didn't load in correctly so we making that redoing his rooms and as we all load back up in the lobby will join up again very shortly so I'm doing that myself waiting for the game to go up and then we will get yourselves the first game of the NLCS week 4 Day 2019 lots of titles kind of available here for this one I can tell you're trying to feel buddy the game though I'm feeling for my own brains in my okay there we go lobbies up the password through the process me and what I see is be joining the client and and I had referee hasn't got to spectate yet a fool for McCain I actually want to touch on this because when players make mistakes like this you know any choose the wrong room absolutely I would ten thousand percent much rather have the waiting time of remaking the game then having a situation where you're forced to play with a sub-optimal rune that's always in the back of your mind you know that this game doesn't have a full credit so definitely taking our time here to make sure that we don't come in on uneven footing especially for a game with this much important at the top of the standings yesu the case all 10 players are in the lobby now so we will be starting champ select version 1.1 in just a second here I think it would be same pics and then there was no action or game of Records do if I have some areas directly to be fine for this one I have at once there was happy the ready to go the scene on players that they are ready by 4 I said he was as well Spencer has asked me what is your favorite meme have an answer to a question my faith internally sweating GIF guy actually really enjoy deep-fried memes like they don't they don't make any sense at all it's just about like putting on mass of Photoshop filters that you can barely make out what's behind it and the jokes are just that it's stupid I'm sorry I asked you the other story so I talked with clg's Academy chocolate bun cuz I thought he was in in the lobby waiting for game to start and I asked him I wish him good luck of course as I was behind it but with all the players but I'd hate winter predictions actually I think is going to win but I thinks it is popping off like a really good right now but even seal GK members thinks you had better have often had so much support from the other players in the league I think they're especially good them and their Academy team at at performing well in scrims and it always have this reputation of like oh my God like Cloud 9 no matter what the record is them coming into the game you know they have so many options and then that is true. A lot of people talk about especially Reaper 10 and how they're drafting it's very difficult against Cloud 9 to to know what to expect people compliment actually work for this this. If you are commenting C9 Academy is just like even there other Squad is there really really good to like there's some incredible tires out there so definitely or gets a lot of credit I think they are very very strong team we are into those not on screen the second round's the same picks and bans we are four champions so far for Apple to Champ select in the middle of the game and then be in it for real beautiful Graphics thank you for the auction team this is what they were picking the way they will again if we look down at once again the GP on topside definitely a possible Target here for early action as real-time can't just so difficult to create any action in so it seems like svenskeren top triangle of the map that includes we have talked about it at midlane up and up words right kind of cut halfway across the map and you try and get to control that area as much as trundle in The Surge warning much later is so effective and everyone mentions always be exchanged you know they are especially with Aftershock taken by Sage wanting early onset Sewanee does has so many options actually she's quite a potent ganker Spence Karen has been a lot of time in the past ganking for licorice and it has been time well worth it this guy especially on a college is worth the snowball definitely agree final Champions have been locked in place of shopping around so the 50 second timer continues and then the loading screen will begin is definitely top Lanes going to look like an exciting at peace here I do really enjoy that it was grabbed last pick your 59 side when you see that seal Jeep don't want to grow a spot lame they want us to take Farm you grab it a good scaling champion in the guys that I'm curious if I come out of her I was going to say how how do you feel about the build right now feels kind of weird to me. Never one doesn't it's a sort of like about one-third of games has the item into it I don't really feel like you sue for need it I think you're generally okay on Mana regardless and I personally always like building in portrait so you can maybe killed him an auto attack sooner yeah I'm definitely not a fan of it but I literally only tried it one game so small sample size regardless
CNET world did you ask a lot of people who your top four teams at Worlds would be it'll be top Esports gaming JT gaming and the baby G2 as number for wool suiting bg2 in the group stage lady gaming in the quarterfinals there currently beating top and they would win the final four of cups and they're part of the way already be true if they can get there I would put some brakes on this train that is rolling out of control here for suiting know because I do still believe top Esports is the more flexible team and I expect now that they actually get red side with both of these teams that hire with percentages are red side than blue side because of their preference for those counter picks especially for topside they will be able to make the adjustment we're not be ports are recognizing the main play that soon and go for are these mid-game team fightwhere is already formed up angel is already formed up and they're running off of there their Top Lane priority from din so if top Esports adjust accordingly get themselves a front-line get themselves stomach making team fight those making him fight with way better than AJ fix I think they'll be set up for a lot more success because at Jay's flying would definitely a little weird and probably was a regular here in the last draft yeah I would like to see maybe that's a sign that he played so well against fanatic a little while ago you're seeing the same that it's a lot of places as real answers jin-li belt is top Esports Have Nots Band Away Kindred is the champion that we have not seen parts of play all split we thought as to offend pick it up for world to produce all the on it feels like it's okay I've got other Champs in the pool maybe an AP jungle like Evelyn make more senseIsrael yeah definitely very comfortable for Jackie love is most played of the Year by far the Zoe and we're looking for last game is picked up so you do have rain for Ranger I like this for spooning when you have dim plus is Zoe a definite possibilities for those mid-game groupings you can get poked damage you can really easily fish for the stairs Zoe Bubbles and Jen W's are so easy to throw out with very low cost and get the reward is still high do actually find somebody with it so is there going to be the answer to do it before the last you know before you come through I should say night going to have her the options right now trying to figure out what he can do against his old team next year Nike came back and copies works out better and better and better to Oriana games in a row going to be his options here and navigate to see bands come through those teams have the exact same three roll andreally not a spicy pic into into Zoey Zoey with the out rain and out play possibilities on the Oriana orellana so much more utility and in Team by oriented to yourself Angel should be super comfortable on his Zoe as he always has been and will look at the support role for the Maine band because again that's where a lot of the playmaking is going to be sent we also already had Kindred at least been locked in for for the junglers they're still looking for some Frontline here and you mean has going to pick that you can just played a bit with the Ezra Hall 4% win rate in the LPL in for a champion with or at 18 with a 70% win rate going 3 + 3 is not as good so that what is a band because of the commons godparents still want to see if Leona is left available cuz that is more likely than not what actually come through and waiting to see those that is going to be the case as they do still want a bit more in which wouldn't be bad to join the Oriana and Lease in the way and Vladimir innocently being banned away on the soonest I Could Have Lied by to make sense it's an appointment for been because Vladimir super good pic into Gangplank if if they went with your name I believe Forbidden Lover I think you have a high probability with a Vladimir band that they do go with the Gangplank though so it is going to be the Resort in quite some time here for Ben they are really doing down there are almost predicting the adjustment of the yes I feel like and and they want to have the ones with the team fight the guaranteed log engaged start up here and since you're already looking at the Leona picking their supposed fourth the fourth the other biggest counter to Orono of the Bronx for the team fight later can't get picked up so I do like it there they kind of jumped the gun and they said they take the arm first only to have Gangplank answered on the other side has expected here for 369 there so it is going to be counterfeit Copper Top Esports every single time so far this series we are seeing Top Lane pick last of the red side makes you know your match up and then try to make it look good that once again it's still physical damage Jungle Top on the TV yes I'd been can fairly easily do armor stacking and he's not done in the first level of pretty good with Sunfire cape and ninja tabi looks like yeah that would definitely say this how about we are going to be playing off of this Leona so Gangplank ultimate is what he has over the orange for the early stages for that Global and you want to use that to follow around Liliana this puts a lot of emphasis on the playmaking for your support because the owners so good at roaming around you can eat a set up a place in bottom side and have that Haley combination or you can just use the Gangplank ultimate on the support Trump linking up with the jungle all right to do it all now if he comes through the Champs are locked in the lineups are there any time for. Being forced to find their way back into the Sears we are on for game two of our second semi-final of world twenty20 one of these Teasley representing their home country for the three piece of the LPL at the world championship and the chance to win worlds on home soil for the first time since 2014 car says being invaded upon and I don't believe they know because right now they know he saw the journey in Carson what are the things that animals that did touch on at the beginning of the top of the day though where the level ones that have been so standard 40s and that magical journey rewards soon with a deep Ward and nothing more counter wart on bottom side though this is your standard reaction anytime you do sniff out that invade thank you observers you point out the word here as Dracula was the one to actually walk deep into enemy Territory news his drink it first thing is you don't actually know for sure if you will recall the way just yet until you see them on the ward you're not sure what Sword Art and everyone else were up to but not a spotted as they go for Li Shang and it's going to be okay car so I can walk up and take his Red Bluff year music. Of course spots Bend I'm going to be safe with Red Bluff leashless starts on both sides by the way is barred wants to learn q and W in the first two men even three levels do points he was not that uncommon just going to really really hurt early Lane pressure sore. Has only Auto tax in passive for early Lane pressure exhaust already burned out a jackulate we can't Auto quite as hard and back a little bit but you know honestly not so bad this already burned on players here I think both lung Fung and sorta had to pop that but he's a bad deal on Summoner spells special in the bottom line free are you are you buying buying an erection for the level to you see how they're kind of crowd the minions right now yes soothing are basset backing off they they cede control they've lost the the war over the damage on minions and that is to be expected as you talked about when you do start the magical journey early there is a price that you're paying you either lose out on that lane pressure or you lose out on with a lot of bars used to do is leave your health facts around for Mid laners for the for the solo Lane impact junglers actually this time of course I'm making some sneaky moves as he gets around for a possible look towards men I think it was looking for a raptor counter still here maybe that's what I was going on but wasn't so basically I'm moving on how we know. I can still smell away is not going to be clearing exact same exact same side as what time did last game as well for the full six yes indeed plenty of damage to go to sort out the Atlantic you not go Journeys away that could be helpful and Jackie love is on the wrong side and that's what time is right behind him where are the teleport or else got to come down when can you get away flashes across everybody to run away for this one they will live but it burns so many resources those are big cooldowns yes the only discrepancy here in favor of toffees or would be the teleport that night hold on to you as Angel tries to make that trap come complete on the bottom side with sofm walking down through the jungle it. They had the fully collapsed upon in their reward yes bottom side for top Esports now have to play a lot more defensively near the ones going all their flashes first Kinder Mark is topside right now and no one's around I can test this one so we're not sure if I told him yet can guarantee that can did Mark but doesn't hurt to wash for 369 pushed in early on has not taken the first three call yet going to do so right about now try to finish enso FM with mid controls going to have no problems here at all Candor market number one going to come through and we'll do our best to keep track over the course of time ends to get the first Mark of the first set of skulls then the next three you can get off the shallow Camp of the Raptors or Grump or scuttles and then where you get your giant 75 in an increase into your range then you have to go deeper in to the deepest Pond camps the Frog and The Wolves or bus so easy early ones to pick up let's see if they actually turn their site where's the early Dragon do with the change that we've seen the bottom Lane standing fear since we open up the game talking about Gangplank ultimate and the big reason here for the Pick-4 3694 top Esports is it try and play ho ho he actually split them doesn't stop you do recall there regardless of the big reason to pick that can click is is for that ultimate and the possibility of playing off your Leona pressure why do that kind of relieved by soon and going aggressive getting some of those flashes down on the side of to yes possibilities are still definitely there though you know store. Offensively bone bone faster can also be punished just as easily as a defense that we going on a free summer hill going to mean to that poke did nothing to Angel and have no problem with this one Drake has spawned now 5 and 1/2 minute then sooning small gold leaves so far Northwest Play Again Play does print a bit of free money stacking up as time goes on aggressive Ward comes down they know they're not spotted hoping for an interesting play is someone going to run to the Jungle not just yet so dark walking back normally Swifty's rush comes through for one fun no surprise there Jackie love making the right choice and building the pickaxe half of mad-eye Moody I think to your by itself is actually a really liked our Trump speaking of which that's what night has Midlands Hospital what's especially if you are trying to play off of you know there's a possibility of bottom side plays you'd rather have that no damage right now it is about to be level six that you go for 369 and he even took the extra fairy charm in inventory along with the sheen to make sure he's going to have enough Mana to try and use the ultimate for that bottom side play I would say that soon should be looking for this also though as much as top Esports you know trying to plan around it you should always be looking at the wind condition for your opponents should be pretty easy to get the small Bart spa parts the chicken but the the market self was taken away cars it took to camp in time at what time should have bought three tickets to late and it will remain only one mark on the Kindred buckets to fight over the red UNG I going to be spotted out by and I scrap one song yep he's a guy can last you to see you right now outside steps as well no problem in our flight in the midst I want to change his real flash to do so but stays alive Garcia's first game results and it's coming to spell going away and now as well finish was the midline night haste and walks out not going to hurt too much to deal damage to them exhaust also used for stacking up these cool dance that are being burned around this Dragon area I'm kind of waiting for it to open up here with with pops plan to try and see if they do for Saint an early Dragon if we get to reset off your first to try and buy them from going to be call stop enforcing know exactly where he is cuz you can tell that connected it looks a little different so he knows it's going on down there then finish up with the way at 4 the cheapest is already in the time to cook top is pretty much passed yes it's possible but the senator of resources is getting really high special but even the counter punch to take a break so seems like he's going to be on the island for a while over the top side but then again you mentioned it before it's why you put gangplanks you can eat somewhere else and play around that Leona and have that happen somewhere else so the waiting for that top Esports player on bottom side to thing if we consider this plant as well because not getting his Blue Book now plus the tear that you mention him starting with Oriana really focuses on just pushing that way of trying to make sure Zoe doesn't get the wrong around for bubbles sofm a nice hop over the back of this Dragon he's going to take that objective before they even get a chance even if it's total crap there and you see the pings and they support room already to the topside for are you on it looks like it's going to be top Esports as soon as I hear the dragon roar will immediately try and answer with the early topside you can do it the herald is a lie but maybe be able to get there is a defendant cancel. O clock to buy for hello I picked up some time to run a fast don't worry about it a couple of caretaker shrines for Angel make sure he's going to feel okay is down in CS and then parsley and he's going to try but that water's going to the fact that we know it was at least leashed Now cars is not going to follow in so theoretically now that they want to go away then what's going on and will see you soon and go to play with very much that's what I'm pretty easily sustain himself knock you down Canton Kindred can very easily could have to tell David to so interesting exchange of information they thought I saw a friend walk over towards Grand so they're going to actually start off the rip drill but the word still is there and sword Arts coming so soon not getting away that they know that's one of the biggest things you don't want to use your movements too early to alert them Forte
find they are back onto their Playoff lineup the same 5-minute last time around but a one-in-four start is not great yeah I have to say I like but also a couple of wacky's plays in the Deep play aspect especially didn't have a really good ones we want our guys but they still need to do both teams with the subs not successful on Day One Pizza swallowed a number to hear free to head off the table Sona off the table little change for Megabucks Banning away the diaphragm bang and has been one of his most played Champions and a little bit of comfort taken away they want to push that bottom line a little bit more and see what else you gotand wait if you would just come out at the end of it all as I've got one funnel band of push through let's see is it going to be another bottom line Focus fan like the Luxor shiver or something like that we seen being used or is it going to be one of these style fries you'll break the effects pictoa waiter halfway human or are a loss of Champions open near as bad there going to be a Missy just a little bit. To put a trundle fan up against amazing here and find a party jungle out here for it right there probably trying to protect us and you know it says wani a nautilus perhaps some sort of deftly mean they're looking to run front-to-back Steam pipe is that a struggle as big as strength is cracking those types of TNT Fireworks vilest highly prized most prized champion in Pro play this year immediately he said one of them is taken out the table and you been with a trundle to grab their own big take if I want to really get here as well and it has ended up wanting irelia over the akali all right brake for people watching the first game I want to sound like a broken record okay Swati irelia together in the early game for all the reasons he said it's how they work so well off each other sitting up each other's Sons you can get a hundred percent unlock there so we'll see if amazing and fake God is able to bring it together those are two of the members that have been put on the team to turn 100 thieves bees in around I hope they can start it soon they are already ate half of the way through the first round robin and it says 0 and 5 start not a good Mark is how this season has been going first one they have the longest recorded a lost streak in LDS history that's a bad start for that has been a very rough on the roster also they spent about three quarters of every game significantly behind is basically a a freak point where it's a major test it is been a rough start run a fever go to the very best of turn that one back around hoping that they can find their way in and save up for Apollo in the bottom of the powerful early game options for 180 across the math now it's a few early play mashups and get real another possible running in later and game number one or Riu he was on to Leah did not get very effective rum to try to go bottom twice to the early game with all 10 members in the entire games going up they were out fought in those room but I think this game could be a similar style of early game proactive moved 20 + irelia is a very viable option and then loosen Flex something like from or no one of those before it can be a very strong Duo and that we can hold its own as well I went around it out on the fuse do you need magic damage somewhere in their lineup at least have that part covered both lots of tanks and flexible solo Lane are always interesting to see when the draft end up the Champions similar roles are now need lacrosse he's very good at removing that possibility what is it going to go with instead year for aphromoo available and some houses do my husband to fart play available in might be matched with hook as Aqua as a novelist yeah and then went ahead and play that front line with the aftershocks however and I was also very punishable the slow movement speed as well as the fairly low skill animazement a really well play thrash and well X plays can be difficult for Nautilus players to deal with you do it right it at least I me everything you want to do and see in power during Playmakers that's definitely true we'll see where Roscoe's on this Garner not typically a super-powerful early ganker but you guys just get there moose speed run at them and force them into a bad spot if you can land Yuri on the Garner then you can start to have some sort of impact in it deep do Leonard especially post level stick for echo-fox could definitely take off so deftly to be around keeping an eye on the jungler to see which one they do to get ahead early passing going to mean a lot intrigued by where the Negro ends up going we can see those to swap back and forth act committed become a bit more, but her there and you can see if you need to or on his ego top wait till 20 seconds to the last block come through and we can guarantee our matchups unexpected stay where they are one of the nicer matchup kind of like the harassment really on extra Wave Control those PDF that Wave Control results in are you getting something accomplished during over you as one of the new guys are trying to stick something with getting him back onto the stage she had previously been a mid-length assistant coach for the team for the entire duration and when he was taken off the starting roster and still been in the background but jumping onto stage once again last time Philly at this time with the knee go see if you can make that big impact 100 these are looking for Manhattan right now both of had long as they can certainly do it open and step up against one of the longest inning do open up on aqua Cedar Creek has been broken but total game together Apollo taco probably still number one in the league and we are on to the rec Pier all right option for invades fairly limited you towards popping up when the things you just D amazing do here on the stage Ronnie which I like for a lot of junglers you got to do that and still look you is start off with your warding trinket go place it immediately in a defensive position behind where you're going to start AKA The Red Bluff right here and then you recall and you go and get your Sweeper for your first possible gang crush is going for the in bed with his own sweeper though and he's going to counter this strategy getting the early gold and experience for his solo laners wasn't on screen there but he waited for that Phoenix could come get into range them can have both of your sole interest plus your jugular all split War gold and it still is enough for them to get that earlier level two little Advantage for your one-on-one level two. 6 minutes here and by letting her left eye means the full pen gold goes to both hello and rush for the extra gold income for fake God made you the rest of work there without much issue One Less Auto down that goes Rush meanwhile got help on his own top spot of the map on starter blue to walls of the campus of adults have the target damage of the machete for his opening belt d a permanent bank trying to push up that the minion wave goes pretty much even though silver sustaining and eats about a damaged in that trade but he still has potions everything available but the early aggressive move by 100 thieves fish opinions down 3rd Bailey memes level to get a pretty similar times but can't really trust box they said not enough space to go for the all in there and it's none of these get their own level there is no aggression just yet if I work spanning ability to knock that one down though he was so nice to not go walk up and take a trade also noticed that amazing is gone for the topside clear here starting red going down to Raptors and and Raptors up to the crugs you have a reverse with the red side perfect for ganking top and the Aurelius a Swanee we've been craving freaks might actually happen and still has easiest a pic of the sun is the akali find the first print the first killing Top Lane I'm happy we finally got to see it in action thought I was going a little crazy there really good heads-up play from amazing but also when you're facing a do like that for solo side I think you need to use your early warning trinket I see so many people ever since the Scuttle crab spawn was put to later 3 something minutes into the game they don't respect the 3-minute Jungkook angst anymore but amazing makes it happen really good stud near lined up against the wall by big God by the way allows amazing to get into c c c train that were talking about who gets the wind it up be stacked up assist Juanita passive before Suwanee was even in range for her own Auto Staci Easley got to Crockett off the end so the one recompense of Rush ran the bottom jean golf away the blubaugh body as well as amazing is stuck on just a grump being available does the entirety of the Jungle left remaining he only got take us to Camp I think that's a payment well worth it for the side of 100 and already I'd say this is their best early game yet freak you're talking about earlier about their stats they have pretty much never had a lead or a significant leaves as it was in the early game by Turtles okay once he clears out the crop as you said there's no other chance from left to go through to your kind of forced into a gay guy do something I get back to the bottom side and actually are able to set it up here do credit goes over to amazing his cell phone so that is more money into this Edge warranty not exactly where they would want it they would want to get the Lucian super far ahead Banks already up in CS and they get to push that minion wave in enforced out to teleport Rush take a look at Camp away and even awarded pop you put one down but now the spots going around yeah if you want to no rush does have flat Glass phone just yet but like I can fake God's nagging with the stun enforce The Flash come out reflexes on point for rush out they go videos still hot on the trail here to look at that solo kill this is a level even levels now a man and he lands this stud installer just recognize he can go all in if in the cloud look at the energy regeneration there a crow as well because there's a lot of many shots the whole time to artificial selection. I looked like to me as one of these best at playing to those reactions has really good even for teammates I like that we're getting more of the players and into Facebook's precious about the game but that was him after getting Kinks Lola will stop and clap while he's alive like I loved it has player to call BM lover freaks because you like to be on yourself I get lots of stuff wrong we're here and everything's looking pretty good how to pee still holding on to a slim gold lead the jungle difference is pretty real xpu eyes but is still on at these up in Gold amazing has got himself in a lane in a funny the top side is sort of in spite of it is already at a man oh yeah I like I was using the grass do solo call he's actually really good grasp user right if it's fairly easy to prepare and he's getting it on blood on this is stacking up help for the game so far it's really going to mean a lot for the tea but I really dies after that last Bush anyway was in a bad spot for him and it did allow fake God to get that extra little bit of Cs lead that she healed more than the Conqueror has from fake God's which has been so far you are a pack of Keystone but it's more of a
Team Liquid won yesterday through their bottom Lane in a begin to pick some bands will see what's front of these teams have for US optic tied for first team liquid just a game behind Lux actually getting bad before you even now there's so many supports and bottom line is there Premier band at the moment the Lux but you may also the stone at Eric has to be broken up Sophia of cancel a check is taken up by Perma bot Lane Focus bands at the moment we would have banned UT and 100% of their game for today does not play and they are afraid of it they are not willing to put it into drive or blue or red size though. Just threw the game state that they are in is optic now drop rise offyeah I know I'm always reluctant to make the jump yes they don't want it Nancy I said they don't want to First Pickett will see hear what they fall out with Ryan as you know on live it got a little bit of a rework one of his many but apparently still on 911 also extremely powerful right up there with the stylist in the atrox and a chart soon to follow so I'm guessing Silas does get taken off and they don't want to let it through is the possible trade off for first pick for Optics I think that will be a team liquid fan so Optics will be going into it may be a real vs. optic actually three and one on red side at all the games they're banning Silas in the Bluetooth off in the first picture I think we'll do it to look at wants to leave after this oneand we will wait to see you and it is going to be outside with that is the only across at least summer split so far the top five regions I love that so foolish child Stout Alabama with the quick to go for though there's a lot of the people in immediately jumped you however are optic going to stick with their tank top strategy right in the more simplistic set up to the T fight I think something that has been a big benefit of that style has been Arrow Arrow from the bottomlands been doing so much damage consistently in the Deep bite for the majority of their wins at least I know has a lot of silver games which is extremely strong right now and benefits greatly from having no not only the jungle cake and Bonnie but also something else for them to have on the front line for see if they follow this when UPS is why he also works super well with a Collie and Aralia you know if you get those melee assassin to stack up is done soalso possibilities here is very strong dual-income through 14 liquids II plus Ricotta's very very great bottom Lane is the Sona and Luxe fans were aimed at them but not those are quite a j on his actually signature pick he's got his own skin and BB guns I hear as well he's a Champion by far stiffer is left up that's expected pick up here for everybody that comes through not only does he have the skin but he has the signature on the loading screen for the champion is well literally so you guys are other parents if they had wanted to go with a Caitlin again and go you know Morgan or something like that and try and seeds in foot No Pain by binding to the traps as well as no rotate that our house around for the auto turrets but they're going once again for the Derek I'm already recorded as the rear akkad game who is named the first one is a little bit Rocky but followBarry Goodwin yeah the split-second initiations I think Dallas is pretty much the go to answer to work on right now it's just more Tankian Lane has a easy time of trying to stop her car with the task of Auto tax play FDT in the kit try and deal with that and there's the irelia that we also talked about already setting up it's my favorite parents with cyclonic it's absolutely insane irelia can start st. Boni Falls it up with so many stuns you can in the hundred percent is 0 most champion at level six there's very few options for getting out of that sun Lok with those two combining lacrosse Champions and that gets pretty difficult to deal with stock up. Getting locked in here which I think is actually very a pat on the champion getting bit more popular overall but it gets to Aftershock users here in the Nautilus Anna said Vonnie very easy old targets to become aan absolute evaporate those tanks went that keeps on false plug-and-play couches that to says whiny Expedia the play the champion for years I think is the best trundle that we have in the LCS he always will hold the tiller until the right opportunity off the times you can gain control go by just running at someone on Frozen Ground getting the Flash and then pillar a game where they flash do to try and get the follow up there if we would have tried to do top or mid lane bands going to focus pretty quick here though with the LeBlanc once again taken off and it is time to look at this draft right now because optic gaming are very physical heavy we could see your other go top or mid that still kind of open-ended so I maybe it's the Mage prefer, Davidson age for dhokla and Team Liquid say okay you know what they do is what position is going to help us be really a Top Lane to make brown play amazedAC to somebody else so I won't have to worry about that this time around is going to be the follow up here for optic though not going to let you if you want to pawn the car Hubbard broken down yesterday in optic hands but either way that will be the half blind pick right there as you know where they can go to either Lane but that's almost certainly not going to be in packs and we will get counterfeit fridge at the end of it all must Block in the other lane and their last solo and asriel it's going to be a you don't need to help me too much Champion but I don't have no bottles can punish I guess I could survive but I feel like it's right here again without looking for JJ yeah I definitely think earlier I like the hover over with the other option right 13thGuide to the coin Draven is the Xtreme Acro one that you're talking about trying to go for the Punisher on rakan and that's where you utilize Nautilus is DC take the fight to him popping after shocking Craven dealing large amounts of Auto attack damage but said she was the safer route looks like optic opting for Stacy and I think that's appropriate given that they have this Aurelius edwanna combination I always want to see irelia instead says whiny use for early on in the game so I think your jungle pressure is not always going to be around bottom you might need a little bit of inherent safety in Lane they're actually do that they've been kind of known for giving dhokla matchups that beg for Gangster win in the gangstas don't come so I do want to see optic actually spend their time up there with the Okla turn around the map of Australia vs. Gangplank impact had to read that are others probably Top Lane Pig games Lincoln really Champions tends to be a pretty good matchup overall and and it's one that is a bowl of phois what is best Champion that absorbing pressure is Gangplank he survives so many dive so many to be one even 3v ones at times so it's kind of a test of both player Frank there we'll see we'll see call from optic actually go up to try those Dives on him back many have tried and failed to task Global ultimate Farms up with the extra money and become so later game Power House with the barrel chain and what thing I am interested in seeing play out as well as how often lays around Midland with crown on azir he has been their best player by far they have played around him a lot and it's pushing has been a lot of the reason they have won their games earlier is here though not typically a flipbook you can hit first but it's not the same as much as bait or Anna Collier something like this for you really make some Headway in this by Ed Lane so if they can play itgreat but I wanted to be black to Pilot that yeah it's deer very much that scaling team by AV Campion from the back Spearfish homes for rent in here and if off the can get back on track currently standing at 4 and would tide in that four way tie for first but up top of the LCS if they win meant they can reclaim the Throne all by themselves optic undefeated start DLC time to take it if Champion agency liquid the hard part of scheduled ahead of them and this is where you really start to see our office is actually good or was it just strength of schedule like a quad of the games has been decent I think they can win this one and then decide to look at you like they have shaped up as well their game yesterday was really committed to me I'm taking down optic means they inch closer and closer to that first place spot and it seems like these strengths in the early game for Team Liquid are located on the bottom half of the map and these drinks for off dick in the possible moves would be on the top half so we'll see if it is a split map or if you try and show up your weaknesses rather than playing off your strength personally I'm much bigger fan of teams tried to play off their bigger strength and having their weak sides just play as safe as possible and try and avoid giving up much but sometimes we will try and go for that defense make sure it happens how to give details 454 Care Optical Genji Center icon eyeshadow to Crown & Decor to Jay's old team in the game again this is the Invictus gaming rakan so you know what are the things is fun memories little Squad upgrade to the new phone from Apple to Android you know like you're going all the way across the aisle I'm going to go with Invictus gaming is Android version so if you know what I don't know what that means but sure I'm on your side with some Toby and he probably has mostly Champion Pro play all-time 3 so if you played that long or Ian has been one of the milinkovic says most often been in the meta while not working he doesn't get a lot of bands usually has it always been Opie but has always been viable so I ate a lot but yeah he throws Ariana as the sort of town if you could say to a good team Fighters well has Farragut set up for a Sia and a gangplank you just ripped through the rest of the squad as Crown is going to put that first Reservoir. He is going to miss that first drink at Fall Out Boy the media is just fine to make that a state as the jungle lyrics on both sides. They're from Big you can see the effectiveness of that after shots to taking effect another one that damn is going to court first thing has learned the shield. The flow just yet three and that's what quite a lot of damage down if you don't check through this potion by the red glow so a little bit of extra damage they do the punishment in main phase meanwhile we had such an interesting little life Journey Through the Jungle here to commit suicide a cat camp at yellow crabs impact on the Gangplank was able to push up he comes down allows xmithie not only to get the scuttlebutt also invade for the Grump and deny videos anymore sources of experience stomach Smithy is hatching awarded Okla put down that could be they're going for it to not look at the sun just yet with the tiller available to me. That was nice to Avail training packet to damage across second of two V1 opportunity even if your teammate is close by I can really mean the difference in those jewels on the top side so good A little movement they're able to get it out in time we don't quite see any blood drawing yet taken stock of the rest of the lanes we can see big walking around getting some more control of course they doing similar stuff and then back to the Rhone Lane Spot Lane close in farm but at least double lift has been pretty close to equal Top Lane is very much impact Advantage enough boards be FM the wave has I do believe but now me to throw away but now that was pretty lashes the way they block a lot of the damage videos of crab do you was already going to pass Townsend way not a lot of time wasted for him and going for that game and it was very effective getting a flash off of double lift even though it cost big The Flash to start it all off a nautilus is very happy trading those because then you can continue to fish for hooks later on and he still has the ignitor available for the all-in quick War forts made it helped make sure you can track if the Drake goes down at some point in the early game at 5 minutes is Frost early and often to look for 1st Recon teleport comes through from SS grabs his pickaxe for Arrow arguably bit more power right now maybe that means about a nickel a better for us to Canada before toppling stilt NCS different mid laners resetting right now is brown is starting his recall Pancho Villa's magenta. Which issues though pretty tight everywhere but top is what the ultimate look is in fact Gangplank definitely one of his most comfortable Champions farming up a storm on that backside got his own Chantix 50 shows bottom to plants to plant with figs and knockout
winning record coming into this week's game but they're three in one command and effect bar from those top three teams Cruz ever run across the board was expecting yet DSM liquid 290 be dominating but it is at the top of the table and they are looking to maintain The Undefeated record I think optic thus far I've had a great start but if they can take down cloud nine year as well no beating this Tina is just behind them in the standings I think that answers even more question about where is the team's limit how good really are they did they just have a couple first thing I'm looking for a video start the game either 100 or 200 and once we can Cloud Nine 2013 summer Katie a 13-point * * 12.7 I'm sad I definitely would belike some of these bands are coming up from Cloud 9 we've talked a lot about banning the TV not necessarily just what is the meta and so many people have been kind of just I think autopilot banding at full you Ben Affleck fixing and that's what you do flies have to take that off the table as well as starting to play a bigger not metal bands whatsoever this is the thing that makes a lot of sense. Some people were talking about well should you be banning the DF I've been cramping for a lot of different style I think that often has not shown that they can play heavily around that Top Lane so now the question becomes does dhokla have a replacement tank that they're going to put them on or do they then Depot back to Carry's which is much more that's spring look for optic which really had not been working out for them as well you mentioned the band to me on 59 there is there prep essentially given the optionKimbo Slice counter picks in the draft Cena has collection they chose earlier from last Sunday was the gragas Yasuo in that was Barbara playing McGregor so this may very well be why he is sitting in on stage for the specific strategy perhaps he is more practice with it this is the end if they got to bring out and is really really exciting to see this already such an explosive when you me actually does the jump onto another member if you know that is a pimpyou making that be stranded sometimes too far away from the rest of the team if you can separate her out and when she is without someone actually latch on to see how it plays out in the game itself second round of bands are coming through his office now to look at the fact that cloud 92 bottomley I thought of the fact that I need a top laner and a jongleur so you're going to get dropped off the table will do it comes in there and he has been this year he is been the go to carry the guy that sings Really prior to getting ahead of this is also what's the LG ran with a guy in weed one they actually ran UV silver they had incredibly successful game with that really worth it can go over and pick up and I think stepping up the farthest place though they are going to have their opportunity to carry the game here to from the bottom sideOptical in Cloudy with a chance please diastole over the rakan band the allister band drop some is basil engage off bins and then there's the porch with Knocked Up on the kit but they're still Nautilus there's still several other options out there Kenneth another Top Lane band has been thrown at 2:00 you can do Nautilus but Nautilus never feels good to play this differ it's so damn easy to spell Scheels at ultimate that it feels like you just never able to actually hit it I just started would make a lot of sense here for a media's going to plug you playing another candle holders jungler in there someone who can be freely thank you alongside that there's no future fries are the main question on my mind is still really do they have a replacement tank for do cleft or is it going to be another Carrie trying to save that for the last picconsidering Ezreal here now would mean that you're going to be playing more defensive Lane as real problem is about as offensive the gas but I think that makes sense when you're playing Jocelyn to call alongside gragas getting attention to those toll lanes and bought Lanes likely going to be on an island there's nothing okay you guys go down to the bottom size 350 or potentially freebie tooth is jungle is coming down the block Buick used with the shield you can actually stop a lot of those their life is going to be seen Guardian as well so if a lot of ways to prevent that but they can hear for dhokla so it will be a carry no backup tank and it's kind of follow-up after that Poppy Gangplank is being as a fairly good matchup into that a call if you can hit barrels in the Stroud pretty effectively yapping said if you do fall behind a call he definitely has all in potential especially alongside someone like you drag us through pain play aggressively but it to me says you actually want to play through boughtDP survive on an island up on the top side use your office down to the bottom Lane is crowned be on the sidelines and in pain ringing in perhaps Garner with those were attacked that bottom line this is going to be a really really exciting game I do think I might have a very explosive draft but it's one that's so much harder I think to pull off with Joselyn a collie haven't been Dash through this team and Diving to the theme there's so much to see between humans ultimate the rise ruthless Garner ultimate they have to play it really well yeah it's going to be a disco on the palate Optical Miss playoffs are four and zero and looking sharp so far last, to the coaches they will leave the team against so far we haveit works for them it's time around don't know tank different size of the map and it will say if you're going to play Carrie based on the style that we have seen optic playing you can makes a lot of sense. They fix for this is my bad for them playing Garry's and stop playing with little play to that side of the lane he doesn't need it we will have an inside with Optical FaceTime stop was that machinethank you very much I'm here what's up with you in the coach of all states ever seen up tickets undefeated still coming into this weekend have to play Cloud 9 today did you get the drift you wanted to keep the undefeated streak alive reprise from the ship. I get done to come to be used in the past we have a lot of tools and I'll come we'll see how it goes it's a very slow, but I think we have chances to win I think it's a 50/50 raffle think it was expected given to the airplane scene at a special in Gastonia do you know we used to be about team replacing an academy used to it no worries Mustang Pacific or the game back to the costumes for the callI love that little bit of a peek behind the curtain yeah Academy though to be fair and he's kind of self-deprecating there a little bit but a lot of people have been telling me that last bit was that you just beating a lot of elcsd Instagram's in a lot of people using I just got to be viewed as a scrum partner because they had so many talented players so they have time to like to use going to be excited see if they can pull it off here it's going to start with some harassed what's Nikki back full HD here but this is going to beGuardian pasta block of the damage boomerang blade look at that look about a team that this is what give me Silver not only is that q that kind of beer you can drive it through the minions and and I can connect the only way to really Escape is just running straight away and getting outside the rain but even then you're going to be missing a minion movies new hits slow it makes it damned if you could actually hit the boomerang blade as a follow-up so it's a very powerful combo but as we see additional levels come and get your 49 on the Bromfield can be fairly effective as expected he is running Guardian there's kind of help deal with them that Folk really at War comes out for this key but this is what a fun things about junglers going early sleeper now is the fact that so many of those Wards are there so wrote Every Pro does them at the same time every game you like well you know if I didn't you put it down I will always put this word out and a free zombie where to look into place there and also noticed that both of us after on fleet footwork to deal with some of the folk of the are both malate Champions and they're going to be dealing with you mistaken for a centrally Kathleen McGrath GP very very difficult when you no longer have access to them anyway so there is any free helpful for a collie and likewise got to a also going towards as well as a lot of focus on here from cloud nine there's not too bad there is Big also put some if the shield and tricks pretty well but I'm already more than a full wave a headgear for Optics is that is very significant know in these early levels and it happened to play it so far back so far. Eventually be here comes blabber looking at oxide plant BP Flash and he was going to the right side of gameplay he doesn't even need to flash follow so that was actually a very beautiful Jiang fare from blabber really well Play-Doh Cuzzo well-timed orange and we'll use the flash to get out still that does mean both Summoners down your Ford Oakland he's going to have to be a lot more careful in these next couple minutes all right now if any way would push toward face the fact that a liquid has more plus that healthier Canon so it's probably has to be a teepee coming in and indeed it is we cannot spell how far what's up a longsword to make him feel pretty comfortable is actually trying to hold a wave Inn in such a way that you know if your classes that for an expose himself to any potential aggression you know when you do have it pushing a little bit towards you because it was there certainly can be a dangerous spot for GP and if you do not know where gragas is you've got to be very careful but it's going down already at 5 minutes and they're down a lot of farm because they're down at 62 weeks of barbet is not really big deal this early on and you can see it yourself in that gold DC up for both of these Vault liner so if they ever run out of man or else or whatever is going to be thinking right back in the lane and and stay he knows present their you've already rare if you want you can pick you up at a medium to your attack damage items without problem as being a rat ear is there for stinky so it's not a terrible recall in any point in time for you to eat it by force if you can keep as real losing 10% of all farm going to keep going there and if you can actually just push him under the turret and then be able to recall and save your TV that's even better right you know if you can force him back and thus far it looks like they already forced back to base videos just Jordan board it and that was all that it required that she pushed him off because they're very nervous about a potential dive at first recalled very likely here diesel stepping boards will be able to do to prevent that for now but he's down below calf help as he eats both sides of a boomerang blade and how it is absolutely roasted in the bottom line for the sheen or I should say that this more power now bill machine right away and not talking to your so he's going for power try to stay alive where is First Blood turns all the face around back to type gold found on the board of the killing this key is a really big deal you're also going to be able to turn it into an infernal if your bid and jungles are getting more priority that means the bottom line is more dangerous than the bush trophic so do a lot of good gunfight at 1 till for the tide of 5 9 and 3/4 double longsword plus the pickaxes a ton of 80 here so he does shredding through it one more time by simply perfect vision there a way you can have a reactor that from meteos Bodyslam flash for from fog really well done steak plays hashtag alpheus take place at LCS official new Twitter account who dis for the ALCS then now it stopped Wayne's bike videos on the right has a red bump and that is a clean one for nothing earlier jungle pressure he did not have a splash action survive and pencil all in no blabber getting a lot of work done already here involved essentially in that toppling pill as well that first what's a really off to a good start regardless he gets it down and the day just turned off push back into his jungle
I just didn't respond to you there how do you prove that I was here I would make it to the cameras on and they wouldn't do it but it would be fine either way I talk to that was today when he was grabbing lunch then I was like doublelist I need some spicy infant information what's going on do you say like freak why did you follow me here I mean the coach getting fired over now that have native with rate so I assumed he was joking we'll see Bobby start a lot of people do pretty pretty highly public that they were taking some breaks at work in a little bit burned out after MSI week 3 now though they have to ramp back up I know they were not happy about the fact that they were out to this sort start they want to be make you throw up there in a in a really comfortable position. They are very early on in the season blocking and play off securing their world strips need sorts of things are really important to the squad likewise had a good spring split they are off to a rough start here to one and three other than one of the things that people were expecting to perhaps Talon those top three quads and no they did have one really good win against you at the time that is one of those upper echelon to use the people have predicted at the beginning of the split but still it was they are going to need to and look at the smile on his face hovering the York impact hear us all a top little bit stronger as we switch the time to take down a figure with a do you want to play styles of course the only hundred percent camping across the top five weeks in the summer split is Silas a truck the most out of the top cleaner overall but will be what I left ends up going could go mid or top eight. We are all the house not really been getting played in Jungle warm is it in N A I recently know there is still tainted Bloodlines of rides are we had been seeing quite a bit of that before styling I've been developing is diving act independently of work on a people are not always feeling like you have to grab that do it together we've been seeing Sia Nautilus dialect xayah rakan so even though I teams are often than for Savannah or Contour fuel if they ask do you still have all these other great pairing that can be put alongside it yeah there's a lot of value here as guests Team Liquid as well for the day is really best on this Gators record has been I would take his best champion of the Year bisaya taken up you are less likely to want that Champions We Believe by good marks you also probably push for JJ down his tier list as well there is a ride that picked up for Jensen we now know pretty much a hundred percent of the time that is a truck stop with rides in Atlanta now it in effect next what are going to take against died in the bottom Lane players are really feeling that it is the ride of made supports that a lot of these guys are coming back in people are really struggling to actually deal with luck support in particular a lot of players have been talking about know just how what is a couch drawing is no gets all in Champions League Aftershock people don't think that you can actually worth it down a plane and go new Guardian it and how a lot of a HPD riding a team fight through that W max deal that you're throwing out and hitting your teammates with so you should see if anyone does Lucky grab Luxor if it's going to get taken away grabbing the ribbon I love it again brings it out I'm excited to see this time it's time to watch them fly out with him before matchup definitely very exciting in there. When you're having to Banter and chance like before so they are certainly ready to go by 4 was playing his signature ribbon against the attempt in that one win that they do have in this split. Farhi absolutely popped off and I came was looking very very good it's there is that work on band that I was talking about because such a powerful pairing it doesn't look very often draw that band but you have people are still comfortable sharing it along side and has died alongside some other high-priority support the right now both need their support you got the look of a needs a bot later for doublelift right now it's like West needs a jongleur so we'll see if we get some decent bands you have horses been banned me how to fly a quest to get rid of severe who is probably the right after Isaiah is really a decent sick as well but it's still much more in the pool overall and feed liquid are they going to push on their sport fan down because like us get first dibs or do they try to pinch been to one school a little bit with only skarner really grabbed up and only Olaf otherwise band there's kind of an ocean opportunity down there and we'll see as the time ticks down but the final bands going to be running out of time and it will be at least because you see the spine physical damage with the ribbon used Tiffany want to win Top link to the champion magic damage juggler would have fit that bill well around that Top Lane the ribbon to be to Elisa's incredibly powerful really Adept at pulling off those Dives as well on the top of the map how to do believe that it was released paired up with the ribbon in their last game against the salmon is that work out quite well for them if we do get erect I hear people you can I give the edge to wreck site in the earlier stages but it becomes very difficult for exide of to fight into a scar on her because people are going to Warrior people are going to damage build these days if you bro when does he fight until they get caught it up by that scar know you can get Focus down before you're really able to get much of anything done and you're not kind of like a back where you can just build a Key West a Sunday after a job to do well right that's a lot more as a rock so long we thought that when they read through believe when they played against optic last week it was this Caitlin wachs as well to Victor in the mid lane and know they were seated upon the very very heavily they really did a struggle in that game too kind of deal with the with some of those strategies so it will be interesting to see if they are going to be able to pull this off themselves the Nautilus will be the selected gear for JJ so what was the fourth I mentioned earlier than 10:00 really be paired up well with desire it is not I wasn't as powerful as the response work on it's more kind of one-dimensional you have incredible engagement do not have that disengage jumping in and out of places for content to put that being said with the root with your fucking your ultimate you were setting up for those feathers to then be following up on that with a route from desire so can be quite powerful in that regard but that being said if you cannot all in lust and Caitlin will put you in it we poke at your turret and they are certainly going to be drawing attention you have to feel from Santorum from pobelter everything's we on those grounds down to that bottom size otherwise they can threaten those pearly Tower tapes and that is when Caitlin teams pain Snowball the game very heavily can move around the map and really take over both side Lanes as hotbeds for Action down you can find a hook on the Luxor Caitlin some really big damage can be done of course they're going to keep trying to speed run with you look at side and on the other side of it of course I'm going to be able to match up ribbon to upload Dodge away from both the the the sweethearts of the atrox to Dodge Iowa. - Board of damage and I can be very very aggressive only one will be very soon see how this plays out stylist pretty powerful off the steel HR salesmen pretty Goods Garner ultimate luck that I think are coveted mean 3 but there's nothing absolutely game-changing besides maybe that's an excuse me I do believe that that game that deal had what effect do you think you'll see if they can so I did have to put his was this bottom Lane that they did face off it really struggled to really get much done because of the power of the DD's drop traps on one side of the turret do you loosen Singularity that Lefty on the other side of traffic is really tough to approach point out as a favorite team plus he's looking a black vest have been very good team so far this year I always do like putting out what it spells these Lucknow Aftershock is this Anarchy stone that make a mistake that helps her stay alive again stomach Nautilus you can save her Q4 when there is natural fight game through the armor doesn't die in the movie to butt selfies in the games I've mostly scene of La Porte IN Pro play she frequently has to start playing defensively against other engage the fourth and get these very very late Quest complete the results from what I have seen I prefer coin unlocks even less ability power you get the gold to buy some AP yourself in the end of being better but we'll see those game plays out you think of what you want to non-stop you get free off the turret and you're at exactly and I think it's a supermassive dependent you know you can shove them in your this is something where you can be forming a gold off of the turret you're not a list it can be very difficult to all in as it's not elect elect your jugular is down here so you may be able to come to Farm off of that knowledge every time he's looking for at Argonne stack and some other with the really difficult matchup can often be rain vs range for a lot swear if you're fighting us something safe like a stone or whatever is going to win those trades you can't always even afford and walk up in and get those filthy frogzz as we have seen in the past and 9.11 which is no longer the current life. So the seventh rise wework not yet in play here in this games with the old version for the edl Damon does about stopping a thing much Silas anymore after the patches nurse a coming through and it was this make out of B those last week we really are seeing the champion in Pro for a while it has been such a huge Mainstay of these professional players are just so good being able to not only used in the ultimate feeling but also this way if they're which is really what was targeted and of course I still see us in this game and got pretty close on Farm Jensen waves is aggressive word for today at 4 with the ways being pushed able to walk up there was a very very good drink at Ward at slots blue and bronze especially if it's ever read side start the opposing jungler you can track the rest of that pass no problem you're almost always a Mewtwo getting ganked both of those doing kind of similar past year they did a full clear fracture Scruggs read now going back to their side Smithy did take an early beso to grab the Predator boots so he now is going to have the ability and with those are cool down to build it for some sort of a play but it looks like you did to do the get back out on the map and I'm just going to go to use that for a little bit of additional power in the room the game where it's important it's likely just going to be doing it since we're into scuttled face and make his first by and then look for some sort of a gank and it kind of has been more santorin Style this what I would say is it's going to be heavily prioritizing Farm not always going for this early level gank even on that at least game against get them when he was paired up with Viber Griffin know he was sitting at it level 7 without even really having attempted Yanks doing I was very comfortable just before we get out but this time he's trying to use in fog of War right now so here really nicely done there but not able to avoid the On The Other Side by Paul Belcher afterwards really good deed you change from them and that is such a good to start your Boris and Horton who did get the power Farm out five Camp, Smith there is a Flash not able to get away from stand for in the phrase Deeds are finishing him off before pobelter would have potentially gone down to that church. It really heads up stuff for me to get to capture or the Spire but I do a lot of far maybe if farts the drive time to krog so get some Vision dad has to leave right away but is able to run around himself so 600 gold Princess Beatrice play actually favors of the Caitlin Lucks Lane simply because if you do not have hundreds year old killed very difficult on the side of his Nautilus Daya so that ignite has been used and we'll see if it's a Hill Lane can continue to keep them shoved in the CSO in that regard so no major advantages in that way and it is keffe taken by turtles so he's going to be the one who can actually TV back to this Lane and try to keep it fresher just as kind of sauces Outlook post play so far out on Vision maybe I should be afraid of wrecked by applying very far from the turret and oh 78204 saint torrent a beautiful died there from flyquest bring up a nautilus Pearl is going for a reset he went back to Baton I think that's yellow is going to assume he's going to reset at the same time as his 80 there but Turtle teepees backhoe fought Lane JJ shows up mid the collapse from fly flights coming in from either side of her this is a flashes rise really nothing did you escape the through that can you play quite defensively for the knocked up the past of Auto 2 Chainz coming in from pobelter that is another easy kill and just his way down already and it's going to be quite behind as far as experiences down 12 CS also and he is going to be a target for these repeat gang because still there is the flash available on pobelter relate to your coming out with the flowers back and overall one time fee fee of course is already on cool down so a slow Road up for the PM liquid Midland air is like my stocks that are back in the jungle and 2 and 1/2 camps compared with 50 has but I will take that every time for to fill to get to gold up five hundred bucks please Midler has 600 goals there the plate of course he's pissed both those things he'll think he's an early start hearing you mention Rex I earn those Central in previously this year has been a bit of a farmer has been great so far I think that is critical Force like I suggested he was so damn good for them in Spring and getting yourself this sort of an early lead on racks I really can't believe in a great position the snowfall the game do your Champion that not only do you have the early success if you get those kills in the early minutes of this game you could be one be wanting Solo laners in the midday and you're also incredibly powerful tool if you do get that early Warrior completion he's really on face
this sort of crazy style Cody son is a very different style play raise a standard Marksman player so clutch have to really decide what kind of style you're going to play in and start to work with that quickly mail right off the bat Clutch Gaming have their ideas on some Jungle Band Zoloft first band is usually a little surprising for me we'll see what they can give it to you later on as they are still going to drop off that support pick and it is I'm sure there was a reason why I and end its could be proved out through doing lots of drafts but I think he is almost always lose Side Band there have to be some reasons unknown prefix before you don't respect that you're also your support as attractive as a very high skill cap as far as I know Des Moines he still shots and being able to jump in and out on Tuesdays popping off auto tax in all in all these sorts of things thoughI also could be simply a situation where you are not willing to bet you Obama I mean wild violets again first pickable here to get there if you want so I reckon and the Beast Engel Jungle Band of Olaf dropping that's a lot of answers available here a lot of them are still actively up yet because got nerfed that is still there call he is still there if they want to go that route Nico going to be locked in very close as well as can be both made our top but we generally do see Nico top yes it was also very rarely played in Flames it was my fault line but certainly expecting to be going up to author Silas could be going tothey are certainly a team that can Flex by a bit well right off the bat we going to see jovon answering pretty quickly in and you're going to pick bought one of the very end unless they kind of crazy Shenanigans and they're ready to go last week it was in a lot of their O2 but it have a fairly good performance you know what was the situation so where it felt like oftentimes he was reaching in trying to be almost as you're looking for these long-range Wiser's instead of combining it with the rest of the team I am happy to see if this time around because I do think the cataclysm set up for some very powerful if you can block multiple Weiser it's an enormous amount of damage and already feeling like clutch fuse again looking for team play a very good to see what they can round out this draft with you to Golden Gardens dropping to the big as of river marksmen off thewho I was David Italian singer probably are the top two overall bot laners League of Legends as far as Marksman are concerned also worth noting that the golden Guardians bottomley this place before it's as real Tom cash so are they actually going to be in a way, cancel or not yes it has been kind of Nerf as far as I know the rank one open it for now that's something out to be grab them course again no stylist in trouble or is only matchup so right off the bat for frog in and now it is read yet ruled as it gets here and go late great do that with Jinx do in pieces going to have to be a guardian have a very magic damage heavy composition when you're looking especially at a half side of the math aliera Miss certainly can be looking at things like in early cow or lemur tread best type of deal can be very very effective and that is always a concern I have when I'm looking at the three AP top side that being said I could go on it to offset some of that they're looking for it feels like the last are switched around as well. engage Gulbis Garvin and not really good team by back up with Rumble and drinks and Silas good all-around can easily handle the side lane himself so you like the Click Five On Five to go to the guardian more required distance in setting it up you got it didn't work still shot Reliant for example I either way I think still good chance it will be very interesting I always liked looking at Silas and in what time opens there are two steel and wild Corky's ultimate is not the most compelling Azrael thrash stage 1-e and Nico all are very powerful the certainly have to be really worried about what if you file it looks like when you can steal an ego ultimate to have so much guaranteed set up for it with the Darvin and the Nautilus we're getting ready to go on to watch turn their face around golden Guardians star in the summer split they are expecting and it is pricey tecnico so maybe this one here yeah so it is on hit don't think you would be going for that ruin if you want Go Ahead Tours blade and that being said you know yes they already have double Martin but I do think it is one of those situations that the kind of distracted themselves into where you have to be really cognizant of the fact that if you're if you're allowing your phone Cisco so easily into magic cyst on the top side in and make it come here early AP that can be dangerous but I'm getting wrapped around on here wow that is that hit if that was a detective left that would have been a slow into I think it would be knowing that it would have landed cuz, I would have fired and they would have gone right over the wall on to that one answer that was not frog in right that was a fake frog in so he doesn't have Valkyrie there's no way to get over the wall and it would've been maybe a flash down by the fact that concert. he backed off at just the right time of the tribe rush they didn't have any information that it was coming over and do the contract is going to be starting with that sweeper will be able to figure out that Ward and applied where he goes to a program to get level 2 off the first wave so if he's at equilibrium at all against money he's going to get to First have the route available to have a good chance that I keep battling with Rumble off the rest of the wave and I could be pretty meaningful as time moves on and on song that goes back up to the top side here and now we look at both these guns with safety driving the red Boston do you do a Lincoln Avenue in Bala have you really exactly where hanser does go you know how I would love to see something along the lines of a width and I think that can be very effective early on it if either of the people that would mean in The Rumble in Tempe right was there but that being said you do still have to be worried about Jarvan and the potential for early Gangsta with that sort of a bill because you're not building any sort of defensive stats against physical damage from looking for acculevel to now is Lyra always not going to spot the ward is it comes around so he doesn't know he was seen it might not matter there might be no chance to stop him off his blue buff but yeah they turn over without a Golden Gardens Hilo sweeper misses you will still get this blue buff steelies doesn't have to that's coming through to him vertical jump length but I think they actually didn't notice I'm not sure maybe go into vertical jungling from that position because almost always you will see the jungles make that decision when they see near Jay for coming in and being there just goes and takes the blue you can see who even expecting this going to check that blue but it is just going to be a three month year for Lira he's going to be able to get the additional camp all right forget I'm done going through the fog of War right now and actually yeah I mean that was like I'm just like watching it back and forth over and over again in like Jarvis like walks by the floor they saw him and just no one noticed so that's pretty sloppy honestly from Golden Guardians to not have spotted that out unless they spotted him know one thing and still decided to just go and give up with rebuffed but that seems pretty strange but it is it is possible given that are there was a pushing toppling from uni maybe didn't feel that you can make that in Vape not really sure either way will be the free bus start for each and every feeling good about that opens tell if you can have a pretty decent I actually admire camp Lee just Inn in current kills for contracts and are you going to have slight Farm leaves in top and mid right now is contracted looks around pretty nails to do and now honey bunny a really good play Anna Hans are good damage there I'll send it back but certainly by the rumble you at the way of pushing and you're able to shove him out you're going to get to see if he almost guarantees you're out of Haunter and who needs to have the luxury of just pushing this in and walking back to Lane so they don't have to look for any sort of curly Dragon play if they want to look for any sort of early bot Lane plays as well and I will see if he can get it pushed in and try to get that sort of an advantageous reset sound goes me but yet again we'll see how long a who he's able to greet on to this one it's always nice to go to stay a bit longer and get a bigger recall off but simply to doran's Blade plus the refillable potion would have to come back with a thousand gold and now we have fallen under pressure is Leah comes around the first plate goes down and Golden Garden Place so far back in his Duo would be a very second plate right now lyrics to wait in the wings there's something in this could be some damage going across and that the flight was pretty sun sun damage come around there saying hey I'm here be smart and now Hootie coming down as well as they shut up the waif how well will this dive go through at the Swap Shop take out here for the Fitbit always still alone and I'm going to drop him that one is to kill a whole lot of seven deadly TV back in his own lane yeah really aggressive play here from clutch and I love it they got to be events on the top side now getting that Jinx the head there are already winning the to be to straight up and Christian invoking doing great work in this matchup that we will be able to see if you back and no recoup some of this Pharmacy vintage but still they even got frog and CPS Authority down for the bottom Lane end to kill gears look like this one more time II play was already down it was good Pokemon the volume which didn't help to dissuade earlier you can see the father on the hook too kind of counteract with Russia trying to do there and you know they were hard committing to this because he had committed to CP they pull aggro here in just books on house Jager around pretty damn well bending of the reset it rabid up your from Lear who is voice being commit that so I can kill 220 music thousand gold lead now for clutch but not supposed to guard his testings around early stages life from last time he had no coffee or Demonte is up to that top Sides Now Judy answering in the Middle Lane so not sure if this was just because they want a cat make up there faster because I believe he did have a seat be available but I do like the moving you having Demonte now has that pawpaws weekends deal from Haunted right now so let's wait and watch what the next play is going to be so you got still at 1,000 gold lead clutch burning after that bottom jungle yet again this time now they know it's no 7 is down there they just saw Olay flash Cody sun has often spoken not that far away from 6mm self but another frog heading back towards the midline Now look for what could be done to this poor Corky is looking this coming through fog of war that trinket without spot for the rotations that contract might do it tomorrow not seeing him but there's always a possibility would these tickets are going to bottom and well they know exactly where he is and now the number for us to actually try to fight here around this blue book case is a little bit late to the Play-Doh on a good smile and give him a right back out of that one's that's between basically nothing against that she told us it is the Gardasil to stay safe right here sitting there with their boss and their own hand not the champion they wanted to have it but at least it's under their control is a good attempt it doesn't get much of anything but it doesnae that leave from frog and as you pointed out so I can wear these little piece of pressure but Oleg contractor able to handle that one pretty well we'll be but you're making the move for the dragon is very powerful level 16 Seer and when you do have a little thick by Jarvan as well as a stylist who has pop up and failed to engage into and when I was at 6 as well you're going to have that guaranteed engage and Kylie impactful pop Blossom wave please the midline. They had a timing out there is no more to be had is that Drake was already gone and now what's that going to come back up if he can take himself 7 rockets and went through with that to you on this package is just going to get out of the map I'm not likely to be able to really get any sort of Romans done with it just using a
plan on right now what are one on scoreboards gear as we look for what's going to be coming through this game store that dropped off a truck just the thing notes on a Tarik going to be coming through you me taking off the table as well remaining at that under for them presents the one time from biofrost that was enough for no one will ever want to see it again the pretty much any pro games as it was a very very attractive in that match with no waiting to see what else comes through ya ever allowed around but I will wait to see you when the last time I feel he's an aggressive course they're one of the teams that would have been probably willing to let out take place on themselves as they were trying to connect tickets backlash against TSM is optic throwing watch sport bands at biofrost discussions pretty instincts they do tend to think you can still play a lot of Harding age that men to Italy and Leona and Nautilus in these types of Champions we even I believe saw earlier today in LA CA poppy played against it at the W can actually block you eat from from jumping back and forth off of people you can get this done with that because it is a dash so it shouldn't lead pencil of shut down phones with play making that you meet has a row don't have that the rest of the grass has been focused on the flex pics on shutting down date is still up on the table so is rally at a likely going to be one of those band out but what do you propose I party junglers and it also could be an option where they don't go for either and then look different apps trade those kind of powerful definitely could be the case here so if it comes in optic ar210 those wins last week were against hundred thieves and Clutch Gaming through the other teams that were about a table and unfortunately for them still R CLG was the other people wanted optic that missed playoffs last time around so what I'm here to see though it is with play sell improvements how high can off the go can they take down to the LG can can they you know it like they have been able to do in a few just let themselves and then and then from there there there any playoff teams and then start sounding with what's think that's really exciting for optic because they didn't make Rodger changes coming into summer right for them it is about refining what they already had about being more together on the same page I think oftentimes they had a lot of tragedies that that made stet that's a dress made sense in trying the South Region always been execute on what that's what her strategy would require you know when they were going for school bus there when I was getting vision for this before so they weren't always Yankee for the football sure that it's kind of what I'm trying to track it. Can your guys's make sense but can you send a follow up on the steps which are required of that trash and so we'll see what comes through very high-profile pick up in Silas was grabbed it right off the top of this one ruined hate Sorel ES300 power people some exciting and toppling personally and xayah can allow for very easy work on Segway Tours end of the first half the draft going to grab cream of the crop pics for them as there's sheets if you want it if you want to take postal is very very early on it take the best known as I think it's in the game and I'm curious how much they think OKC or how much they Next Band face yeah yeah they're at their is away from these I really works as well as the General Lee is going to be a successful there a silver certainly can be a pretty decent answer into it if they do like to go that route we will see CLG though if they grab their work on here have the opportunity to be in on some of the good support answers things along the lines of no more, even after they are going to go out there, they are going to elect actually prioritize their jungle here that's far too it is weekly grabbing his Jarvan and he will be going up against me deals on 20% acetic we want me just only had two deaths across the two games and one of those was executing to a turret as they were winning the game so certainly performed incredibly well and we'll see how weekly who also had a very strong Week 1 new in particular in there when he was very dominant again under these I was really pushing amazing around the map so we'll see if he can come to replicate some of that stuff so hyper violin Gabe jungle pics grab seal Jeep Wrangler than they actually pair up the duo down there still the Jays fan comes in keep my CLG to get first dibs on a Asus Banfi wines down they both teams need a support and a stolen actually exist and sociology gets the better of that one and we'll see there's there's nothing they can remove and then we'll kind of figure out what they want to take some salesmen support and encounter pick the last solo but we'll see. I think that would make a lot of sense unless they have are going to really kind of at the Norfolk that is conditioned upon dress the trash it's really good but only if they don't have access and then you will see people save a support pick-a-little Leona Banh sinh Vera's is office team is kind of heroic encounter I've seen that be very effective a lot of time to visit may also a be hinting towards the fact that deal do you want to go with a different base support you know you you also see Leon has a very strong answer to things as a long line of his are they played last time if you want to play those for the folk style engaged is often very very tough to deal with the enchanters are gone right now they are the atrox on a truck balusters here but yeah with John is going to be Lux now picked up again we're still assuming Aftershock most likely but it is going to be of support down there I think that makes a lot of sense based on Leon event know this is another one of those pokestops at bored to death want to have rain she does want to cut a dictate the pace of that line I do think though if we could comfortable blanket that I can still be a good answer you can also look for other hard engage answer's no thrashing certainly isn't an option if they wanted to go for that route copy works very well Zappos Darvin and irelia so you could take this up for your Top Lane here give that to doka he played it last week as well as being able to block a lot of the dash is there you and that is worth so much really is power is actually driving back and forth through these men ways to deal with the use those recess in a fight can shut down a lot of what I really want to do definitely agree to means that we're pretty much guaranteed now that Crown is playing Silas here in the Middle Lane and plan around that pic now is thresh comes in for bit and if you're rude you can take a lantern but if you can do that and now it's time for Stihl G's final pick they could always move locksmith for crazy with that but that seems a bit less likely regardless though we'll see what they want to do around of the composition what's the weather going to be what I want to do if I can go there as well they take epoxy counter pick which Victor sorry I was Vladimir that's what it more looks like they're irelia versus file at the mid Vladimir beating up a tank in farming it in the top my dad very likely will be that sort of Jackie but we did say that last a week or when Crown actually did play Vladimir a guarantee but does look like it will be the result irelia also works fairly well on this island has an ultimate that is not very impactful if you do steal it great you throughout the Army don't have any reset you haven't accused actually use off of that gladimir should be able to kind of force out a lot of Mash Bros it's all different bilcliff and it's always think it's very important when you are talking about a tank if you are a different type of damage as a top laner than the rest of your teeth be all the force out spector's cow or an Adaptive Helm and Berkeley tried to leave early on dopa means that when he gets a G by Guess what does irelia G4 call physical damage in your going to be less prepared for that reality when you get to the campsite definitely important we'll see what comes through this game if they can make it happen to an 0 a good start to the split now facing off against counter logic gaming with their new changes a new top winner imported in replacing darshan who had been a long-standing member didn't get the pills back into playoff form a tough fight against TSM was the most recent loss over the beating off again be the thing for them American ready to go loading up on to the rift we are ready to go in this one versus TLC could be a really exciting one cuz this does feel like it feels he that's more set up for that bush is optic who's more looking for that team fight now this is the two or three can you cure for optic where they essentially have their main consistent damage dealer is only are right you know they do have for pseudo frontliners and then Arrow that's a lot of faith in this marks player be getting worked on in the team fights yes Crown can put for some purse but he is not going to be the one to actually be winning that fight on his own it becomes very heavily rely on that silver and it's cool to see them putting that faith in him once again into his credit I think Arrow has come a little bit back more toward form of this split and I bet you think back when he was on Phoenix one that was an MVP performance he had that title to his name but it hadn't been the same for me last year and a half or so this feels like he's kind of getting back of that for him he's been a good performance so far weaker opponents to be clear but still a possibility will not be enough you will walk away after my live there and wraps of Austin is more willing to commit to it they could have flashed over the Senate and guaranteed that kill but you are never certain that you're going to be able to get it and actually do end up getting both Kasa TP back to Lane since they waited so long to do it so that was honestly a great play here this is from Pee-wee's Vision you did actually spot someone up on that top side but assuming that the jungler not the bot later he had no vision of these guys but that's none was massive the boomerang blade does connect on both sides Crown getting that first password reset in the Sun and outbound the bottom side help to hook for two so far been doing a really good start as bioprocess junkies just 200 hp he's already because I don't have time to go back to base so spending the spells in midline and then having to walk straight down but he is already out of only was he in the mid lane fighting exeggcute or the brush in his jungle because he didn't know if they got them anyway cuz I'm cool down and that is a very difficult start now comes the part where you get little too when you start using the spell shield and a spider was play Dashie Super Deluxe a couple times and bought Lane doesn't mind game of your spell Shield versus for clarity and if she doesn't pop it you just burned spell shield 22nd clever nothing funny watching some people will play against ever you do sometimes see players doing exactly pencil sketch out to the side of them trying to get the in a throw of buying attention Officially missing out to the side and hoping that they will your reaction uses Bell shield and then it becomes a specific good enough to actually sit on that spell shield until they can guarantee that it's going to take him from and then use it that becomes a pretty high-level mind game and I will respond to follow that butt up on the top side Brewing is playing klepto he wants to Farm off of dhokla he wants to scale up and really put himself in a good position not to be dominant not only in the team fights but also in the sign language is really where he loves to play get down to make sure I can stay safe and wants to go right away on to her a CDL class without Farm doran's ring is such a curious dark here though for the 16th at all it's almost always going to be a dark steel or even if you want to have more potions that can go that route for you just go to the door and you'll allow him to have multiple potions at the start unlock the door and shield and it is still quite a bit a pea in the health and becomes more 80 which is pretty good and it's a five on hit damage in Vladimir's auto tag pretty crap so I get an extra 5 is helpful so it's very much my laning phase is better and if I shouldn't pop is an issue it is not the best aggressively hey I don't need the extra postage from the dark steel I don't need the reason for that you know I'm not going to be ready for a sadorian shield isn't the answer in these types of situations a lot of players will just try to go to the greedy by which is going to be something like a ruby Crystal and go between the CBR but again as you say that is left breast if you don't have the AP you don't have to be on his help your theatrics so we now watch as the middle and come through again temporary for me for Tarheel but as many waves bigger big trade comes in there but can't get return Auto Tech on the crown who's waiting and wave during good stun and a half a cup Crown goes down regardless and blows his own summer this is a no summoner build planner who just got a skill in a 1 b 2 for first oh my dearest music by the first it was blowing air out anything actually will stay alive quickly to kill the algae that is really big and you can see the power of evil what's like you want to go with him so he actually does grab the early recurve bow is very likely will mean he is going to be going hard core for this with the probe you replay it's a sin for the reset does go in getting a very low careful not overextend but there is The Flash just too little too late he goes down to spite flashing out harveyville able to walk away but oh my hotels in his Tepee still on cool down one level one so despite the solo kill their this actually may end up putting him behind look at how many minions he's losing down in experiencing that is the punishment for that level 1 play definitely coming up big here so going to get to watch it one more time. Trying to go in the Sun but Crown what's the menu at first because of that minion Advantage despite the Dodge on the side just doesn't matter power of evil didn't have a minion to get out and the ultimate slow is more than enough oh okay well good pick up there and we're back on the map with a $500 difference cuz you're knocking down some more.
I-4 in past years so I want to see them getting back to what they learn in Spring and we have to go to keep an eye out on the game the game how it gave Ian and Greg are performing because these guys are competing for the starting spot. Definitely something to watch for absolutely of course Greg had a very good game last Sunday against the LG Acadias back in so far as soon as I get Saturday Sunday foot on expecting road to play tomorrow for example and we'll see when they nailed that one down we are the champions like that you mention irelia you meet vandaway in the TSM side flyquest dropping stolinas off the list do want to point out we seen a lot of middling a truck over the last couple of days here as well so that's Affleck's pic in and of itself and a very strong man with that being targeted Dust Bar in a three of the key ones off the table to the bar and I still rise as well as a collie but these are convinced that have received the first and Anime VR going to be as high priority coming into this week I call you and Chase the big still in as I got into this weekenda little bit and 1.0 banter flag with the 40s and get first dibs on this one and waiting to see what comes through we had I believe a pair of Rise games out of filter himself rather than enter to win a pretty good while doing so do at the bottom and comes in as Szechuan e as both you've been away a jongleur to you than the first picture being taken off the table here by to get them to their is the opportunity to take away is tarek I do think Derek's you can function quite well independently of this Donut for you still could go for something like at Eric acronym for us to pick some flights which I think is very powerful in and of itself and then still play at an apartment is very very interesting because this time last year or to say when I stand alone but you can't play Sona stand alone so far we've seen so many even without these kind of crazy as well as the stand aloneshe fits with almost anything go ahead take the turkey won't matter if you do and I like that Evolution that we talked about that's very very interesting to see that adaptation and that their opinion, has weighed on that matter I do also think the fact that you be has been so prevalent as far as presents at least it wasn't very well in scrubs and I think it was kind of showing some of the teams that hay and generous support in these kind of base before it can actually be quite effective and one of my concerns or you're not going to able to have that is that the economy is in the big game where you have this tank support paycheck and brushes and putting down words and that was always why a lot of people said if it's like so no couldn't function in in in the right and now that you'll be has had a lot of success working Sona independently more often it is kind of interesting to see if we can find more of a shift towards that even Bob Ross painting of Zyra last week and it is doing the Googlechange of matter is that moves around cuz I do agree I think it's a whole Suite of Champions aren't thinking right now. Probably could but you mentioned tarek and Akron together but is CSM who gets the least Jungle which is a nightstand out for me they say Okay Jayce is most important role in her everything laptop and now Lux is picked up and Azar to support luck with Aftershock but we can leave seen her mid as well a little bit Yeah you say it's only picked mid kind of has that counter Fizz do is when we've been seeing it recently I do also suspect that it is going to be bought land but a very different route and tarek and that in Akron with Linda I thought they could have gone for now they haven't You're simply giving DSM that quarterback I wish they used it a few theology last week they had these three pics plus I believe Jake themselves as well as billion deadline for Puritan and that was very effective for them this time for strategy is pretty Telegraph from flyby so this is Dad looking to attack the top side of the map and there was an interview last week a cue from contractyou would ask about AP junglers in and he was talking about he thinks at least can be very effective only one paired with one or two Champions Jays or an act that they have the jcf this is someone that can bully out the top line that can set up for Dives where the elite really will excel so your GSM is going to have to pick a very I was thinking a self-sustaining top layer of pain play defensively because I only want to play around the territory can use that Dazzle Bastian, absolutely and of course we'll see what does computer finish off this Ross where we have still be so willing to TSM yet to pick flyquest get old Smith final counterpick Year's Eve bands are nearly done Camille dropped off the bench super dropped as well as you can see several Watling bands have come through trying to Amite wildturtle Champion what he said you know Caitlin got some bust recently she's looking pretty good now is bring this one out dad and then Caitlin + Luxe in a function similarly to have work on it and Caitlin does if you ever able to hit a binder you can trap right out of that no Post 6 the birthis going to be bringing with that ultimate that final spark is quite powerful to certainly there is the volume potential there if you can be on point with those bindings and Pike into the Top Lane thank you ji 2 evil to bring it out into the world we can see it mid as well to fill winter almost certainly regardless I'm expecting top into Jason well if you want to go to Camp someone I think you could probably get rid of camping bike reasonably well and not even a blind tickets on Mid laner I really don't think it said right here koreana probably you know I think that goes back and be pretty effective rise also does work here you know that says give you a bit of a flex pipe potentially with with a pike and the rise but we are expecting certainly Pike to go into the Jace arises going to allow them to play in those islands thensee how effective the counterpick is going to be here for Evan Jays goes back in the mid lane keeping the ribbon or the question is just because there is a potential to steal but hike into that Jade if that's what they want to go for but this is very aggressive you're from flyquest it feels so much about the early game you need to dominate with this Elise you need to have bullying Lanes here and they're really going to try to ramp up the Patriots vs Viper alongside the lease this is definitely going to be at Pike is going to stay up there I am excited for what those two players can is a very physical heavy team you're lying on Jungle Italy sand support locks for your magic damage so if that's going to be I'm really excited to see if they can pull this one off really think he needs dominates yearly game if you allow this CFM Squad to get to those later they just we saw what they wanted to do and we thought against the LG very easy to ask you diving onto a champion like luck similar to do what they did I get the ball frost on his Ira if you really can abused does low Mobility bait supports with hecarim in combination with that tarek so I have to get a lot of work done your league everybody dies, 1 + 1 0 and 2 the big storm we had coming into summer split was who could crack the top three of lap splits Team Liquid TSM and Cloud 9 black Westworld once I got the knob it was a slow start for them and then Torrance ederle packet wasn't going their way but now there are others against one of these top three teams they're up against TSM team a deadlock Immortal in a week when is a good time to strike for flyquest certainly isn't something that already kind of noticing here is it actually coin Sona the first time I've seen this does make quite a bit of stance against such an effective Lane like the Caitlin and the West because you're simply not going to have winning trades with him often times very early if you ever do get bound up you are going to actually even just died to a trap was whining combo so this is going to allow them to play quite possibly and still maintain a high level of income so you know it is damaged will be down a bit but he's going to complete that fight song faster and then be able to start his farming faster as a result those are going to be more Mana Regen to dispel these would have given to a he is on heel duty all Lane long to keep through the alive little bit better at that as well and we are going to see what happened to these little ones as it is. The roster Camp as BSN leeches the red stuff for a ktnv Duo fly right over the line at the store this morning not deal with a two-on-two too early on is not that one down and he's going to try to bypass the brink of War Camp Hill be spotted doing so as soon as early levels you can see turtle and JJ posturing very aggressively they want to be able to threaten and onto this Lane and rubbery smoothie that has to be taken the farm before has been actually completed question of that is usually a how they are going to play it out that is very very very difficult for him to actually get done here again to locked in a Caitlin and not only can they actually no bully out that to me they're very effective at knocking down parrot place so that is certainly another part of their plan here if they do win that to be too very heavily you can start to move them around the map hike is certainly not someone who can cut a fold in that want me to type scenario either very low on the wave clear so that they are could mean a lot of her place going down across the map and right now she care cuz I've been allowed to get Farm plates for CVS on Stone and four smoothie kind of waiting for a farm to get his weight around as these battles keep going back and forth to book The Odyssey does with Aflac Westside the healing of what these I'm going to do to not die in this one has then walks up grab that little bit extra golden 7c ff14 support is a fairly slow start here now I am curious if if this Lane is ends up being so I just for me directly and then taking you know whenever the coins do come in. The place I like they're going to have not seen points on a myself as the farm roll but I know they didn't Envision I've been seeing you this way you can actually Farm you know without having it turned off like this. These two would be so is that might just be the eyes you hear this will be a much lower income Eric then if you know certainly an adaptation on the tragedy which I think makes sense in this is a dive you cannot really pull off because of a deer so they're going to have to back off but already getting some good ship down on the spirit Acadian right place right time though so just wait this guy but you are making their own yeah, 19211 e Lake Nona is the primary from a member as far as I can tell so cool new look here on this one but it's still an early trip taken down it was about to pass directly to be there in he did and stayed alive on this one but and this is still a few on to lie to myself and you just got hard Buddha Lane off of that but even with this strategy you can see it's been already sent back to base hopefully for him he has enough for that coin upgrade he does have teleport turtle is playing TV so we'll be trying to really keep this Temple up in this bottom line and I said when we go back out of the map is Ben bringing his first teleport and getting just the fairy charm Andre Philip ocean not the most exciting start also become an upgrade which ya zal thumbs up to me silently and his freak don't miss that won the coin operated horse early gold income that is so much of what it is about this is a really smart at atation based on the length are playing again I wonder in a situation this just makes sense actually just go Aries and instead of klepto as well right because for the similar similar thought process if you are not actually getting a lot of Autos off in lane at the klepto gold is going to be very low you're not going to be like actually stealing a lot of things I will have to go to tractor out the game how much he's really able to get through back by Coon because if he's not going to get tonight I do tend to think Gary would probably just be more effective I actually grew that Keystone tries to hear one thing I do want to point out with this coin plus Farm Sona gold basically identical to Wild recite the ten CS difference the gold is within 12 here so this is definitely working out he is on parody completely and eventually that will be a late but eventual combine there has to go for a little bit of damage there has been placed in the house so attacked back for the JJ has Steve Deluxe tries to crawl out through the spell T cells have more gold interior otherwise do fairly equal quick check in on the top Lane a small farm in my mind is actually winning in Siesta and will long term but this is been a fairly close one we want really hasn't made many moves you did go down to that bottom side of a Dancer by Katey and so not really any commitment to that besides that he's just been kind of power farming here know he is up and experience over akkadian currently level 5 to level four but it is not the kind of explosive early game that I think you're really hoping for as wife West I do think that you were hoping by the time a chrome is 6 that's important is already killed a number of people are forced a lot of summers are or kind of breed is some sort of significant Advantage for his teeth and that certainly is not the case just yet and right now Central flying away hoping he finds heckerman rotation apparently is doesn't walk by another controller doesn't put down earlier listening pop the blast cone and now goes to fight this war Das the Red Bluff has spawned right now it's getting is taking the long way around level five. Both these players and is missing in a glimmer of early game the grass is coming to your house or at the Alise it's not to kill this is really nice and you can also see if you look at the mini map of this bottom side of the jungle look at all these wards that they do have in his whole area these four words around there for quite there trying to establish control in this area because water has the pushed in midline so that would allow you to then set up a situation where you can bring that for me and fought for potential 5 of that is what they were kind of showing in early levels they have been able to pull it off. Seuss far but that is the kind of things that you do want to see I will say it is a bit surprising to me though that he has been playing war two words
set up coming into this matchup going to be exciting one one thing I do want to Team Liquid head analyst tweeted out his team Power Rankings last night for team in the LCS so I got to see that High Praise from NLCS stand for the country pretty cool and either way you're looking at and someone taking them usurping them in that top three it's probably your playoff opponent once again off the table so that bottom Lane safety there that definitely had quite a good performance on not going to be available the atrox of course we've had off the table for quite a while since that first game the ceiling on the current patch has gotten out of controlstill bring the big ass and get the stain long enough for at least 45 to get in it I kill it or is this do you make you don't have a downsize all right will call Bar still available what is it you want to remove what can you counter pick time ticks down and they will still available with Alpha possible Silas answer as well as the rides are there a lot of muscle flexing I think a flight question me has been one of the teams that did you realize that's especially for Top Lane a lot of those carries extremely well I'll guess they are going to grab that one Rises going to be at the flex of toys Jason I call you as high-profile so later still available we'll see if one of those gets grabbed there's a day throw it away and do the kind of colors that somewhere else are going to go and if instalok on the oval right away with only their is denied they said no we're going to grab this as soon as they could be flexible over here from Santa and Elf on the bike run for some reason completely hate the champion that was what it used last time around he said since one for the record said he was going to use it at I think it's a little shout-out to himself to get the double lock on in the end sky and rakan for the bottom lamp without a lot of people have kind of gotten off of Israel as of recently because of the speed of the game especially where are the early as real picture seems like it is giving some very good power open a wild turtle and JJ has been a very strong bottom lamp one more attack damage Hill tots to go I think all the ER carries they were coming next in line are very very strong right now and are top-tier the first item ever complete so you still got a solid early to mid game I want to see more Triforce Azrael come back but you're not going through the item you're going to space I think I would also generally take him and games where I need the safety as opposed to just blinding him all the time by themselves they want a high price on the list maybe we will see one of those possible running supports that have a big impact been in to be paired with that Israel has generally want their bottom Lane so they can focus on there so that just makes sense to me with the lineup that they have the actual players on sir and frog in this top triangle of the map along with contracts kind of where they make most of their early game plays this based on what their Fielding so let's take a look here they did feel a lot of frog and targeting guys here don't want to have to worry about that long-range damage has been very very diverse mid laners I have you know he has a lot of these long-range high damage AP mid-length Kaling Champions is not as good in that regard but has a lot more generally speaking deal with a lot of folks out early better than a lot of other Champion the main strength ER of fight of course is the mobility and a possibility of those all in you can stand up your jugular very effectively expect a very offensive liorient the jungler Jarvan definitely a good combination here you can gain from multiple angles and put pressure on that lame without would just be exciting of course right now if you have the midline has been known matchup so what is let's play 280 watch this game for quite as long as that's what frog and has been associated with anivia is Champion for almost 10 years now since the game started rocking has play the champion in the mid lane definitely one of the most iconic Slayer in Champion pairings of all time and it has very frequently been taking two different iterations of Rise album by Charles rice has always been an ultimate and the wall of the Nivea I've always been very good schools against the champion just got a farm early as far I'm up here a lot more yep I'm going to chill for a probe you real quick if it's going to be exciting around the board Viper I want you to take over on the absolute water games at MSP when doing self and Viper he's going to take down golden Guardians on this pie you got to step up as well as fighting one we're getting ready to go on to the red boat these teams very very sharp Squad 1040 for Flagler because he has turn around once again want to go over all the incentives for ganging up I claim yes the bike if you don't think the lane is going to get pushed in is going to get her ass down but Pike has such good all in with the mobility with a bone skewer for pulling a back that's game setup you can share you money if you get the kill and he's level 6 has the ultimate so that we could be a lot of jungle attention towards at top at school for dinner the Garvin at 1:50 for the assist if it comes through waiting around for what's going to come in is Azrael poke soundtrack to do some damage you got to be able to get a klepto proc I'm more valuable custom how dare you Vision stay fly tried to say bad things about words difficult jungler I like this guy with Azrael it's not going for the max range Mystic shot you just walk up wait for their Dodge and get your auto first you have been fire your Mystic as you can get an extra chance it's a similar strategy with a lot of skill shot Champion specially or in the game where there's not that many variables you have to worry about well early pressure goes Golden Gardens way to get that Warden try brush it will not be at least of the flight was do was going to be Jarvan just taking that red by his Lonesome very slowly and recs I doing the same redbus do you have a negative armor with Barry Switzer Auto tax Pocus come and take them down so low as to why right size ceiling red as well as it would take 20% longer if it was blue and really do much for her and you also always wanted to clear out your red side because of the air we camp and all the extra experience in there because they're both going to end on the right side at least for the very beginning here and we talked about tonight Jason being such a volatile match of fear that if left alone with benefits of golden Guardian if you leave it completely alone author is going to be able to get for a play money is going to be able to get that harassment is going to be able to get DCS played itself out the extra variable that you have to throw into the match up that gives pie the threat and the reason that we saw chicken International play it is a ganglion is not one that's going to win outright in the wonder what it'll withstand in the ones you want but that's that's that's it doesn't do you help it out here so we'll wait for will not come through and right now his teammates santora has cleared his top jungle and he'll be walking back down to the bottom side it was red to blue drums the now is to wait 30 seconds for the scuttles to spawn cars going to find a ward going to self 10 gold and not all of a sudden I was going to tie my pretty soon anyway Supercenter in 20 cs212 poster board and they are going to split the shuttles top here for contracts again he wants to focus on that top side of mat to keep concert in the 151 and try and avoid any sort of interruption there meanwhile santora now that's an option for the bottom half of the map you can see he could go for an Invader with his bottom line pushing up there's a big Advantage for flyquest isn't really game all Miss bottom half of the map Golden Gardens want to have a safe bottom line but picking Ezreal top 10 seeds all of your early game basketball quadrant of the map and that means they here we go we are going to have that invade we get to move up front JJ may be able to take away and punish contracts due to their bottom line pic contracts had to give away his rookie wasn't challenged until this point in the game but he's supposed to say OK top quadrant I'm going to wait 25 seconds Four Tops of us font then take it to say that Jason keep pushing and in kind of gave that space there was time to go for his blue before that that invade ever did happen but he index words make you sure that haunt their could keep pushing cookie flavored out of the blue but I might be worth it long term the top we match up and it's definitely worth it given the composition that they have fixed and given that even if you can go for your blue it will be a risky fight right anivia early on not very good at roaming down to glass for you and your Ezreal Tom kench Lane also will have to give us get there through it if they come to help you defend with that about the truck and that's where he ended up there it's still golden Guardians up about three hundred gold overalls of squat nights devour going to get up and try to cool down it is very long but and that's a bonus of the do a right to Tasty Tom catch Azrael basically in the game here and you can see exactly just firing from the fire within the two shots always put a lot of time in on Tom Kent has been quite on point with the devourers as of recent contracts movement after the four of Rex ideas for with very little peanut purple bar Spike here, both the sides in it and push it but it is a 3 Camp lead for the Jarvan of full level in Leominster gold I just getting very deep now even though it's Jace does have the priority in the top matchup it's actually so deep in the jungle that we think Viper of kind of edging towards this area to and pulled out easily collapse for no man on the side but nefeli low on health left maybe UCP not going to find that hook I've got to be able to walk away but still down those three Camp to talk about don't stress it is turning into a bit of the the top Wayne vs Leeds has been the same with all this jungle pressure top for Golden Gardens he'll keep his arm in a way but Jarvan poke someone the farm is actually gaining that money back in the jungle match up and it's not going to take too long before the Jarvan has a super substantially over contract becomes even more threatening Aaron with him picking up the challenging Smite gives him a lot of opportunity turn the tide beer in this early jungle if we agree just yet but plenty of money on both these players and they're out goes desire pickaxe plus a couple of longswords is a lot of extra attack damage really on theirs if you did come back and Elaine what wrong with this BS it just gets two of them down to one more Auto attack and it still supposed to say yes I miss that that's unfortunate really yesterday you were popping off about what was on screen Their Eyes Were elsewhere meanwhile topside Viper is going to have to use the TP early on so if you saw him collapsed onto case contract out of the Jungle and is an answer here very quickly by on Sir was going to be able to use this early lethality to continue to throw out the damage like I just made this choice not to go gay for the spikes and it was going to take over bottom half of the math projects coming over with the robe know on a new vehicle and as you will end up in 3 on 3 right now nice pickup camper contract
you're missing from the previous when I bought individually 40 was completely fine as a player and flesh will take a step up now today and I topped ashelawn Squad here in the ALCS irelia top of table very very very fast the band also coming through as well the fact that but I think they may have predicted some of us trying to do but Rumble Jason one final band going to be a rise in a C9 side and now clutch what really the first pick on Silas is up to keep mine so is a collie two other important picked out there as well alright I'll start at Eric has been left open and they actually are allowing such a kind of be the dare you know to break it if you put in your kind of stuck with Sona without a against the Tariff and a collie trading hands and seconds in on the second an interesting matchup with stylus 2 Coastal me different ways that are a lot of different changes you can make with in the match of as far as the Conqueror in the bill that you go Silas definitely has his windows with their later in the game versus the college alright well I'm going to be up directly one-on-one we'll see what they all go if you like any of those players can play those Champions hack trim Nico Kenan all Band Away fanfic lemon gaming what does being on one Accord Cecilia Stoll in a crab for either side and the jongleur here as well as been one jungle bana to top lamp and 59 second 12in followed up here they just like the acronym makes so much sense with the donut Eric the super already gauge damage juggler Kindred also can make a lot of sense with the Deep by composition it's in a much different ways not your heart engaged so you have to get that from somewhere else and they're just kind of taking off another one of those high damage done that has another ultimate that can save this also Kindred vs Rex I tended to be a bit Kindred save it if I understand correctly which means that opens up and grabs right away by coming in as well as a solo Lane Pike right now so getting there in Fraser from Wonder Over in G2 cuz I wine yes it is okay go I mean it's flexible you can play it as well as cute but I definitely expect it to go in the hand of the Jungle also pretty cool fun free I thought this was a really interesting last pic to me the ultimate that ultimatum so good at actually getting the kills on a pike the hardest thing with pipe it's blocking and dad is still slippery has all this disengage can't get into the deep Waters and go invisible but Camille is one of those Champions that is so good at all in a pipe the Top Lane is going to be a battle who need liquor is it was one of our Premier Top Lane matchup yeah and they are going to go take it to 11 this is exciting because ya booty again essentially why did the pike it was indeed a Liquors getting last pick for top-end says okay you're playing top-flight probably kamila's my business spicy absolutely junglers that can make early passes there recti definitely has the advantage they screwed up one of you enjoy doing with Ali thin but it is going to be about how they coordinate and track the enemy jungler to get those times. is it going to be all kinds of fun to watch for here is going to be an electrocute for The Stylist to conquer for the akkala look at it ruins we put ourselves of this one the second game of this new gaming roster with Cody sand on the bottom light they have Titans ahead and go in Cloud 9 and now we got C9 themselves over the key turn off the LCS summer split Ping's already going down 69 jungle here looks like clutch might go for an invade see it looks like it's hot outside Alcor Spike can be very good level one that can you can be pretty nuts Oconee Flash and there's maybe just enough follow up with work on going on the war that they expect to be there but the rest of Clutch Gaming will catch licorice unawares licorice good spot right now and he will walk away know someone is burned Lil Bit of damage dealt but now it means that drunk control goes to Clutch Gaming side to put a water the red. Well you always should be responding on the opposite side of the invade as soon as you see that you can see the move into your from C9 you react instantly go in and get cancer Wards on the enemy jungle so both sides to have those before it's on the Red Bus I do really like those of a want it shows that it's in preparation they know where Liquors likes to sit at level 1 to even had Lehrer show on a war that they knows the end foots down I love that kind of love 1 preparation is sadly doesn't mean a whole lot of enforcing your pudding to learn hookshot which is probably but they get that anyway and now we have the battle starting with a blue buff fuel for collecting stuff very aggressive looking from Clutch Gaming going for the NBA taking away this blue looks like some? Things are trying to split them a pure give up their phone Bluetooth to the East Side lyrics and they continue to farm out this guy's going to be already at the thing you have to watch out for always as early on Farrakhan definitely extremely potent and they're using that to their advantage so far as soon as Lira shows on this Ward on the red box that will alert fence Karen that he is gone from his own side Passover Zone Ward here just continue clearing route answer right now if it was perfect information about these sides do if you want the top side fighting I could do more damage been in here but clutch knows that spend went red deck rugs down the Raptors and kind of the camps that Leroy had as well as pretty as I surmised that was blue bromp onto fat red buff so and now is a run through the fog of War we probably have some guessing if games against the jungle sides we were taking actually a lot of farm you're doing the Raptors as well not going for his own bluebuff though I could have gone through fog of War I believe that is a ward in the river put down by the mate so that would have been done if it happens if it okay to drink if I'd have nothing for almost nothing take away yeah he's going to lose out on his back to fight him rather than going for the reverse clear though and that is going to be the first objective and though they're both trying to lose them right now in mid being pushed out by Demonte means it's pretty easy to own the bottom River you could see Cody spend the bulk of doing the same so there is exactly one campus events during can take you out of jungle Camp Lunchables with that yeah we should see where I just crossed straight across mid lane and grab the other stomach wraps answering his Midland is also put stuff right now though it looks like the desync Top Lane is going to be the bigger tell licorice is moving over to make sure there's something Force been scared to take washable wool does nisky flexible Chase q auto could be out to kill him that he should have flashed cloud901 already worried but still on cloud nine with first one to Cody sun and 1/2 minutes in and everybody is partying down on the red bumps side of the Jungle of fudge gaming except for who needs the bike is pushing on topside he will get a turret place as well as which of us a minion into that turret another look at this replay here they changing jobs Amante licorice had come in and called it off but as soon as they see the bottom line also move up do you see on the mini-map Liquors also starts to convert that to mean that eventually Cloud 9 what has more numbers cuz they have everybody down on the bottom half of the map so much damage do by police on here trying to take them off but this is able to cut him out long enough for the arrival of the C920 Wheatley turn the tables to get the extra feel alright so this means we have a 300 gold lead to Cloud 9 but no control here honey holes in the crab and Leo grabs the shuttle now as well who need us at least still down in farm is licorice comes back up top went after the recall after reading c p and has more items and more CS how many will be on the back but somewhat here is licorice at the shop at least it's going to go to the kill a wild snake that hard to keep alive but see you not not terribly far away from the bike is trades aren't you doing in tailbone putting drops off at some pretty good damage that all the damage up what we talked about earlier the hextech ultimatum so good for Camille here in the one-v-one with bike definitely has a huge Advantage so who you going to have to be very careful and now that there's a lot of extra money on the Camille as well as the approaching level six you can just give them play very far back right now is being pushed around by Demonte a bit and has that assist to his name I am roughly equal across those players into that thing under 4 without too much difficulty and now we have left gaming again more pressure in this bottle a in and look at the farm different just 45 on this diet to 19 on Eric that this is more than double plus the mountain breaks up the first what Cody sun has put gaming are alright slaughtering the bottling to onto it is not closed right now really well don't actually going to get a little bit behind but not this much behind and Lane versus is diarrhea console really aggressive looked also the room up into the jungle was while they were more minions killing off their opinion so a lot or deny there and that is going to be a fairly big gold sink here and what are the reasons why the gold is still so close to even seen I got the extra show I only can see you as they pass once again by each other than bit later still a bit close with the Mazda is winning in form of Ralts actually largely a several Lane lead the jungles up in farm didn't quite well it's actually really only licorice about who needs for his laning phase leads here you can see the gold despite the extra kill has now down to an only child afraid of back and forth but you know it it's it's pretty close your overall as a game and let's give me I think so far being somewhat impressed if you came into the split you would maybe not expecting to do well against C9 but this game pretty well so far back as well before be to there are no rules of the P90 second plate falster play going to drop now as well and how far back to have to play threatened by the time that is completely split map right now Cloud 9 weeks I down on the bottom meanwhile top cyclists Gaming's weak-side there who needs having to defend against all the looks from Licorice and Spence Karen roaming around big big Cash & Go on the plate on the bottom side for Clutch Gaming very nice PowerPlay there to push in and get some gold out of disadvantaged can't right now 900 gold above sneaky not a completely Fair direct comparison but still factually accurate 900 also up above the Derrick which is the one for one right now in this point in the game until she can complete that and now liquor to retain most that back up a liquor still does going to head to know Straits got licorice has command of the topside you so about 300 go to wave or a head from the kill that he got on the bottom half of the map and as you can see trade goes pretty close to even as the potion and passive from Pikeville can heal uni back up and just find a flat fee of liquor stores in but pretty easy to do in the back of the beach too much of a difficulties and even though you don't like you in a bit of Mana make sure the minions all go down spent staring now lurking around. Looking forward to keep this one in the fog of war paint. Tulira offer Supply in a bottle closest down in Plymouth from the beer in the depth of the damage the ultimate that's the weirdest looking for place not going to get any kills in a 1405 out of the top side looks really good there is playing out their strength Racine I try to focus on the top that did you get the two V2 Advantage Missy rooms up there but it's too late and that gives Tomas an opening to go for clutch Gaming's advantageous side of the map again passing on bottom this will be the turret order a kill going to go over the Clutch Gaming as well as every single plate light number four and a 10-minute birds for a glass Lane is working wonders of the roster change this and maybe clutch turn their faith around with this player upgrade is another look at that I was going to get a ping on Lyra from the past of wear recti give me daily goes in guess the doc up stopping him halfway through as a hectic ultimatums game from Licorice and you did real flash out of booty full commitment but you can't ultimate no big difference there by consummate get / do execution ultimate gets the kill on their Tower
they ran into a bunch of frogs around their overall cultural practice and and put their putting on the stage of these teams here trying to change things around going into the summer split will see which one of them damn rather finds more of a diving a champion slides take it away thank you very much. We are here for the third game of the day once again it's the only thing they get their start a wind here in a good tune-up game I feel like both these were Squad that did Miss playoffs in the spring split they both switched out of players in this is now the combination that will win the game on my side of things are both good choice for the team's I think I have high hopes for both these flies yeah they talked about a lot on the battle of the changes that need to make changes to make paint yeah after last wet and they both did so in addition to the new players amazing and ruin on both team I also considering a wiggly fairly fresh on to the lineupare y'all coming from their Academy roster as well as silly go and I both those guys already played on the starting roster but have still look like they need time to work with the rest of the team and really melt can do a lot of Stella Lane bands of we're seeing the irelia collie Silas and Rise all taken up the healing monster anymore we will see this special kind of stupid smirk on file Frost Fate Zero ending face if you don't have to pop off to much I do like the fact that all that you do have to get off of your mark been some time to get your auto attack so you can get your shield and your bed is a very dramatic get your killed off and getting to know that cool down as it changes over your level by the way is definitely one of the finer points that's who you me and we'll see how well that is used in trades we've also Isaiah was talking about but jumping off the clock is still shot and then jumping back on so you do have some health you can use to know scrimmages you don't have to just rely on your mark then you give me at hello Mr armor in Farmers fine or else only slightly downspout thanks for supporting is a male a chance of hopping onto Champs Lakes Edge Ronnie and end in Frontline with them and this but I have never and will a lot of people are focused on the uni Ezreal Poe combination silver with the boomerang played in the Ricochet takes out the wave and you be able to poke them it's so incredibly annoying go see if there are you get some Vision you get them control around that bottom line we can be very very impressive I did went on the TL side now it's banging app removes turn to pick that one up definitely a few of them on paper should be incredible that because I've had a pretty lackluster spring split but I'd still believe in a pedigree of those two players on at these a squad that the top three teams in the end of the year and it wasn't quite there but we'll see what Santa looks like for the second round table yeah I mean that the team that because go to the star power that you look at when you look at the roster very high expectations amazing coming off some time in Europe so time are the Jets coaching jumped around a little bit not quite sure where he's going to land as far as being back on the actual Elka stage but Garvin definitely a jongleur right now that has a lot of option where the few that can still go for the early King free Scuttle crab you can still just go Red Bluff level two and try and get that really pressure off on one of your soul ain't that special we can be effective so if they have any early targets here for him to go after to try and snowball ahead typically though we've seen some day be the focus of early and bang be the focus late Sunday is definitely done quite well in his Lanes go see what he can get after these ban yeah they want to play a Ouija Nico has been about Champions. Clear through trades as well as somebody definitely well versed on the champion but it's also flexible so so they could take her up very standard Warwick cover for 6 a.m. favorite Champion that one pretty much for power of evil he was or not who knows he's going to roll the dice pick whatever he wants and now we got to figure out what is apoplectic going to be could go to mid lane instead they got to kind of keep track of both those matchups pain the very safe blind and that seems very likely for us here if you're is a d can be booked in ya Canon can just focus on him and he can stay out of the flame spitter rain should be able to use the exit visas to try to avoid harpoons as well and also bring and equally effective APA ultimate to those team fight if you look at the squad that coz of drafted here it says wani Frontline very standard here with strong support backline threat for later in the game so very clear John Cena fighting are for the tlg side the combo with a hot pot Rumble Jarvan ultimate on top of each other is here is that I have for later so definitely have a more possibility similar to set up right then I do like the lake antifa hear 100 things but of course they were scaling scaling very good as well there's no I feel like an obvious but lots of really strong points of power across the border to be a lot of fighting to be pretty fun here as we wait to see them anymore swaps where they are and they are these are the ones for sure final remarks from the coaching staff and we get to see the very beginning glimpses of worth changes the right ones were they enough to turn the face around coz famously last year missed playoff Miss what is well a bit surprising but it did happen open the now the new top later no longer with dark trying to be enough hundreds he's hoping that a switch in Jungle rain amazing back last in North America spies years ago on TSM the world's top eight then back in and out open to bring hundred thieves somewhere good super excited for the bottom Lane specifically as well so busy I work on into the uni Lane how it is going to be annoying for those all in the idea attack them maybe they combine it with some jungle attention maybe early game at will tell things already coming down though we might have some Ventures out for a possible invade group that steel G looks like they're going straight made with everybody that's got to be a look at it in bed spot them and no yes map where can I go inside the state and look for something but there's a chance I can get Sera. He's not a very safe location right now definitely can jump over the wall they could have actually made their way all the way into this jungle during that what they have not I like that we also got to lie in anticipation similar to 100 thieves experience their very authentic definitely approve and now they're rewinding a little bit here invades for the Deep Ward but actually a c is it just the one sweeper start both sides with the sweepers starving as well and with the zombie Ward to get a little bit of protection all right nothing too dangerous here I do always really appreciate Superstars level one I think it makes for very interesting mind games and great possibilities here and especially for jungler lunch break you can do is actually start with the trinket Ward's go out and place it then recall before minions spawn grab up your sweeper so that after your clear when you're going for your first game also be able to use a sleeper to ensure that they don't have vision of you first get the value of that trinkets to clean a used for at least four solo queue as fast as ready so it's damaged, it's also because you can't support with her little help in the damage based Championship cut down is actually very very strong at his presence of mind not manaflow band cuz of course it couldn't be but it's a lot of mana and a lot of damage that is the point of that champion always want to stay attached to your 80 Carrie wants to go off and get that passive Auto attack jumping on with the shield is able to get a good trade there with sticks a what level do you Max right afterwards you look pretty good for this when I connect rating of Southeast damage which is also very effective here as you mentioned in champ select with the silver images early odd they get control the Wave Bar prices going for auto attack trade-in to the q's grade as well while sick stay focused mostly mostly on the minions exhaust for 85 Volvo to be less aggressive version where that could help feeling to the server is the forest EP on service was you going to be really focused on staying up in the lane keeping the farm going in now. We're looking for some jungle action early Recon can go for the all-in engaged soon as amazing just wrapped around it is a push-up ways they are very far far will aphromoo move and there's a spot of another way drive from Newton ice flash gets away from a thing or not to summon spell down there worthwhile game simply time of isn't being also didn't have to lose too much dies at the turret that's one of the drawbacks sometimes of skanking the soup push the plane if you fully commit for it then you're a d ends up losing CVS in exchange but in this case it's just amazing going in gets a very valuable Flash the only one of the lane off of 6/8 and already you can see the change in how you have to play the way in there's no flash you also have no vision this early on in the game so they're going to have to respect we looked out the mid lane right here is power real battles with his opposing member insulae go now in the top laners ruin with the Quasi counterpick there's an expectation that. Not a guarantee and puts in the Canon gets the scepter Nancy is doing pretty okay up there but for evil inform this is a rebel who's been able to form so far all right breast recall for amazing is going to find him on top side since did the red clear here. I'll just might has been picked up. So there was a little bit of counter jungling as we would be able to get one extra camp that means that we have more to farm under threat they should not be till they already knew that they saw Jarvan top at 6 is going to get Savannah back here to off the level up maybe you can clear out this way is bank so much damage to this current they get a plate by themselves very good for the hundred piece you out tonight and finding us active root on his dick say just pulled back as well for 6 I can still bring his own teleport do you know this from earlier and right back in actual money doesn't put them out enough for a pickaxe so he'll be reasonable here I suppose U controller comes in and won't miss more than I think maybe two minutes yeah definitely good for the hundred thieves Duo to be push up so they can walk back during the timing window of the teleport usually or teleport can really do you think that and give the extra advantage over to the server side fairly quickly and are already walking back so should be able to make it down there pretty quickly better recall her bag as well for us 10 more City Art by having Warhammer instead. Such a pretty solid you be a course in the sheet back in by just using you and me and me a piggyback in the teleport very curious to see again if we have repeated ganks from amazing on the bottom side it's very effective Blast Burn as you could already see the instant results were how you have to play the lane you know silver hassa play more cautiously biofrost cannot harass as much because you need definitely very horrible winner it he carried it in a Flash however they also call Wiggly defensive Vision that we seen just now placed in the mini-map by CLG is a very good answer all these three trying to defend against the dryer vent on your map. be able to see the driving force amazing back into his own territory which flag and dragged away has been heard in the lungs in the river is done goal so that's going to be just fine is there a spot around nice people is about to go to space out. Look on the fly fly away from an open wound come in just yet I'm amazing just assumed that it said Ronnie is gone since he saw him exit into the Russian has left with weekly stays around with eyes on the Friday to find a gauge are the jarvinen CLG first flood on the top part of the map this is also opening up bottom side since they know that the jugglers. Yeah you got no vision of power of evil orianna gets the bird
just kidding of course but with that we are going to get into game 3 in today's LPL Clash will be covering the pics of men's hair from state farm animals that's going right into them things I did before things like the Lucian to send driving a few things like an idli the one where is some talk and find some top 40 the canal and exciting things like the grave perhaps you can use as well well with high priority on gin as a first pick even a conversation will be like okay is it the Grave is going to be a huge priority here it has been a band away but even when it's open you know teams opting into that Den priority in first pick in to believe in Nashville wants you on right side or seen it from both side so that they can you bend at least nearly Graves open if one of them Gets By the way I asked you miserable as well but we see the Night Champion being taken out which I think is very smart move heading back to back champions are seen when is douching he has been or have two games in a row that's the grave so I'm expecting to bed now and again first big factsthe same draft because right side seems to say the museum in the past its textbook are simple. We can go to lunch if that's going to get to the early gameplay then but even a wreck so I could be good I don't like it here is again karsa sofm legendary Gleason players and so the fact that you have been such high priority to then pivot and then have such high priority on listen to we already talked about you know how is real influence from both of these 80 carries we did see a little bit of a hover of the Calista the like this is a lot of agency a lot of like pocket picks for all of these players and when it comes down to thisvolume at 51% I can't play my opponent this is exactly the type she can't be what you want to listen to someone like me doesn't go away from your come for the pits open at this to Pickaway something that Jackie love is super comfortable on that their insurance until he's in your dream about where you can catch waves you can be safe on your own you can use your ear wait to get some reason to leave him but it can be counted it seems like I said I'll bring the tray even hear anything related to losing it because you don't have any food options to go to Center can take our paying fast for things like a cape in the Draven even things like I said I do really want him so we can hear that Mom did this yesterday pick Caden on blue side left their football picks at 2:05 to take want to go from like 8 to Morgan County so Kate and Luxe towels work better I'm expecting some kind of response from swimming perhaps as your car might be one of my brain to fold or they can just pick up.longer cuz I feel like if you don't pick up the dog around 3 they might struggle and up in the end of 45.1 paid already talked about how the Champions on Sunrise together you hit a lux binding we thought from on team liquid that comes out you can put out massive amounts of damage and now I'm sure it will double down on a schedule so I can maybe support like maybe by to take away the, to make sure the absolutely want it to be too or if a Sunni or just going to like stack the bottle and I know that they have the as well he can place a few can form from a distance and then find a really strong set up support like that Leona and then a double down on escort from finding some sort of hard farming jungler and then allowing Sword Art to be the primary dank assist or set up for that care of simple things like hecarim are still available at what time does play even if you haven't really shown at world so far so he's an old-school pick for himthreat against the Luxe valse Opus Luxe occasion is running some like a cleansing get popped in a c c combo things like the ear pops even think like LeBlanc if they want on the side of puppies for sale Hannibal composition and it's like a plpl stapling classic there for leasing but that makes a lot of sense of the team fight so I don't need things like heck out of here I'm going to things like Rectify perhaps even skarner could be good if they can find Carrie top which I think something is always believed it would have been on the horn last game if it's past time on orange decide who is playing Harry Potter the Deathly electric oven if there is no feenew things like a gangplank are also still available by Banning Pilots it does have me reinforce more like a game plan going to hack room is kind of a pic to round out the competition because I was obviously would be able to take away those big key ultimate so it does make it safer to pick those Champions would you know that night and 369 could have also taken to Silas I wonder if you might want to pick away GP here cuz he is so good to their comfort think you could only have many Pounders other than maybe some rainbow painters things like the j-6 you want to go into a ton of matchupsPittsford hecarim hits the ball delivery feels like I'm expecting some plastic countertop 369 it's such a good matchup GB fish and always have to push it looks like in to the midline of Ariana from Angel and I mean if you can look at something called you know they're diving your back line as you was playing on his own in the back line of himself so the chimney or end of the hector Mobile going in the back line Astros being self-sufficient and I liked it I liked response until Beast would still take him H don't don't allow yourself get throw pick an assassin with an old with, play soft Christmas Waltz of every single Lanediving in the backline who gets there first we've already set up the heck remike Becky there would be here if you suppose you are worried about that all my God you're so excited to record but still talk about Harvard cable first lesson is Jack's rolling he's on a leash on the sidelines I think that you have made as well spill on the riverNicole well let me tell you he wins. Fasi the single Target damage the Raptors are the Raptors going to school so you won't have a problem with that then it's really good and if you ever Your Dragon control as well because friend is really good to me Drake with a Q and A wr3 to get a decent engaged to the owner said no and you have some cycling pressure into the mid game when it's hair was down for the tunnels. The power farmingthis is about the set up towards level six maybe try support form for it to get it very early on in the making plays into the side light and most importantly setting up his top laner for Success like he's very brutal early on but you want to make sure you can get that out of the way and then make an unkillable with a channel that later on Echo running oversize fifteen52 much where is on the other side so I'm not sure they have the or they have to have a decent Team 5 confidential around stuff like this but that was so deep inside pressure so it all depends if it had your side pressure and going outside pressure you're going to do somethingboth racks of Thailand's which means we're still going to see Team fights because that's all you said you guys are excited for Games 3 thank you very much shocks and we are out of the rift for Game 3 of Tide score between top Esports and spooning in this best of 5 and already we get excitement at SUNY are going for the rest of the bottom side I think is really smart cuz you if you get a sunburn still out there Caitlin likes laying you can destroy them and then I got to go from Moore okay I will say that this they used in early Caitlin let's pick from Top Esports in the first game vs tuning in the semi-finals and it creates the situation we're both junglers not just carsf have to deal with the possibility that we have to do it a possibility of topside volatile matchups plus a Caitlin Lucks Lane which wants to Perma push want to get to under the tower wants to farm their own turret plates off that tower has the possibility of falling prey to a Leona Chen combination that's why it level one looking to get a summers fall off the bottom Lane could have been a really big thing for sooning because they want to know. can use the threat of your all in with your Leona Shannon coming down there to punish the ever pushing Caitlin Lux and you can see who you enjoy going for Summoner he'll now Guardian is very typical for sport locks it was actually nerfing building used all the time as they're going to kind of Step Up it is that you do not win any two-on-two as any Champion it is always a lead that I could walk in and auto attack and must run away makes to make a play happen but now 369 go to play Christian early on and I am intrigued with how did early game is going to play out because you have a push and topside a pushing bot side but a losing Midland cars navigate around both dreams of the map and it creates a very interesting dichotomy he's going for the red still here first this way you circumvent the problem of a Shen going up trying to help Jack's because there was that starts on a little bit but really lay her on Jack's early on and especially if you have a lease in cycling on the top side of this map by removing gen-pop side can't you make it very inefficient for the shenda go up there and try to help that match up and Carson's going up there first reads bar is charged up for 369 but he's one else is there going to be a stun what's the time in the bottom side of Shield come back out jacket way to safety for The Flash come from Sword Art comes through trade it back though it's going to be a killed him and one for the back for Lux still dedicated carriers are both team to play that lady with no fear freak when you're playing the Bentley on his side of it lets you have to follow up here on the jungle do sofm want to set up car seat in the back Little 3 for mites for help me that's what them gets me very easy take of drop and carsmith is onto pants to for right now rivershed can not be trifled with black machined flat and it might be been going you got to be kidding soon in 240 topside Fireball Jutsu BSO FM style of me on full display here but we are going to get the Jackson early lead are you kidding me this is an overwhelmingly great start for suiting gaming considering the Champions the life that they had this is a dream scenario Renekton down in farm down and kills to a Jack's bottom side already burning Summoner to Leona playing aggressively getting that Advantage there sofm forcing the early Smite for help from cars that finishes up the group and they go for the kill Bin does not hesitate this is a rookie on the world stage your semi-finals to get the extra skill and then right back at it all night long man to get sponsored. W feel does it mean too much and I can walk away back to mid lane as get shelved and looked around for CS difference in mid Angel picking up a bit hex flash behind Jackie let's go to be found out stunden play not alike he is going to fall baby wearing something to the first meet up here for sure Sword Art also sewing is style hexflash over to punish the flares just keep on coming for me to Flanigan's Jackie love like you might have one in the final but you're not against the LEC today buddy you're against the LPL we're going to take you down soon as I got off to a great start so far in game 3 night has Ulta manage to stay until it's and damage walks away night's walking into the summoner's rift in the whole thing is on fire right now is I have a head in CSI here on my echo matchup in midlane what's going on in the sides here top Esports number one LPL teeth are coming apart at the seams and it is due to sunnis flexibility something that they have been criticized for here and they have really shown up such such big moves here in the early stages now got to calm down though and look at how they play because the veterans here on top Esports still going to try and retake control the Kaitlyn luck still wants to pull the same game plan nice deep were there from Sword Art does see the hover from car seat though and they won't get it off the ground right now I mean it's Caitlin likes being on their side of the map is just such a beautiful Vision here for soon and gaming because the aggressive play from sword and how long they've been able to take away any of that priority from Angel and we got a 2000 gold difference than I got stuck on the G2 player actually because he looks like say hey look at this match if you one but if you try to find a b o v e level where is the Team Liquid Flair where's that number MSI semi-finals from last to look at something about a tail Jack you up it's like hey member losing in the spring split to JT gaming and I can tell you suck on it
rematch of a spring split finals in his number two and three teams the world I'm just speaking slightly Impacto and the rest of Team Liquid show me for several years now right off of the table very early from Team Liquid one of those flip wishes they had to deal with it had much time to practice on the human also following suit gas pumps in Lawrence right here with wheels come through this one is a Jason is also added to the band tools impact could take that one as well as cademy league is everyone it's so I don't have to go deeper into that story for the team. Be on the table. Liquid bandage on you in the garden that top plate or Midland the fairy Bible a scary on all of the flags at extremely good games on the champion and is definitely first Aurelia and Galley are broken blade in support of course very strong enough to support Team Liquid as they already have incomplete that bottom land for doublelift a core JJ which in Spring was probably the number one bottom line and leave but I will say I do love that Jensen Hubbard as real what do you think I have to bring it up if I'm worthy champion of Jensen and doublelift encounters like solution will Ben still hover an Echo Show versus even after that mistake and that finals you're calling back do some big game breaking a mistake because he locked in set up decide what he's done after galio goes in for the flash Hans of Teagan Hunter for Census Bureau people he was in at CC duration on either the Galleria lane or the irelia lane her being able to set up right side and always being able to close with the cue reset and then get those Auto attack and set course we already know is Iraq on locked in here the duo of the team liquid side hit a CZ Spotlight pic for has been just difficulty that probably next phase of fixes breathe what was the first ban over in game one as well and Cloud 9 in the turtle this morning has been so driven definitely being a high-priced big apparently yeah I've also heard a lot of priority on the silver recently in scrims for most teams with the rise of power of Crisfield Sperry recently over the last few patches John Silver's ability to get that wave clear so instantly makes for roaming for your support and that's great for something like a Leo man when we might see her band against then now as well as we wait as the time ticks down one more band can be and if they were dropped her off the table would open up the top side of Matt for logic record almost all of their spring Games Team Liquid Israel hola amor early aggressive how are very strong feeling very fast clears is Olaf and get all the way around the map and now you did last Dolan we need the most pick champion from the spring split for impact that Kenan but if you think that goes like that's going to be locked in after also Ken and comes through he's going to go right back and think of what he had which is very helpful yet exactly hybrid build going for some a pea in the hextech revolver upgrade super early on into the gunblade so you can also swap into a lot of a setup is not the best solo initiator if you have something split-second engage bike work on its debts up those big storms that big are we that people I dream about so so effectively on the side play enter here with your zero wall you have to watch out for that because it's such a good answer to mention also ways of pushing him out and and and knocking off for us the team Galaxy will do that as well so it looks like I have a very strong conventional two-on-two xayah rakan every early the phrase that is only to the second half of the W as well as one of those Champions poppy ultimate you can guarantee he's dodged that second swing of the W and then say 22 kind of there and you do whatever you want around the champion instead on this could be really powerful to see what comes in as you got broken plate back on the irelia he has been impressive impact the same though on this cannon has the kleptomancy could had a farm some golden convert into the mid game to this looks like a rematch of the finals of incredibly strong team to put that back in the fridge number two TSM fans been waiting for this ever since the finals ended beginning of the school year nursing now on is beer a champion for him as well but looking for a bit more scaling in that mid lane see where they start typically again he has done has focused towards the top side of the map ever since they added Broken Blade and this guy is really grown into a star coming over from the tsp really found success as the team grew and put more and more confidence into his play really peeking at finals allow it is Vladimir play around a lot of those fights in the NL Team Liquid were victorious they went to MSI they took down the defending world champions and their back looking for more by the way you guys are awesome thanks for that CSM and see how are much less active than you and the early game except has been living with you so we got you know five gold is exciting without setting is TSM it seem like a chance so they did get onto the Raptors so if Acadian goes with the classic red into Raptors and go get some early information on this Edge Ronnie and tracking will begin it's pretty effective for Olaf to be able to get a lot of Hannah jungle and early on you can see the two deep words on the map right now that were placed by Team Liquid ecstasy ask these to both of those games they do get Vision on this Edgewater freak as a marksman player and every time you see on the bottom side snap it happens sometimes you're the best of us. Just double if that's okay I feel better about myself and you can watch the first person I'm about this Midland pushed in by Bjork Smith make sure he's not going to get the set by Olaf I can have to just text me if he has 12 pallets and even less Mana as the War II comes down and says okay chickens already gone if he's going to be a 3 cancel could recall you for Smithy all right let's do it goes with here on the first recall because you can go move speed and he is going to go with the Boost what's a control board here for the vision plan on the top half of the map and he is water walking plus nullifying orb so he's going to be really quick actually going to end up between those Lanes in the river there that I could be pretty powerful, well we'll see as you can talk to the cops I know he's only barely a camp behind but you know with the refresh man Tamar and they know 100% that says wanting is bottom half of the map because they had to be bored on the above as well they know that they Sewanee will be threatening doublelift in Corte De Sol xmithie has full power and influence is irelia Lane hair we go sit Sewanee once again showing all this just grow up by Scuttle crab now yeah I was able to find it with the scryers bloom so please get some experience and gold for himself and doing stuff and then they will hundred percent on the bottom River Lily Awards already going to be traded as well we saw them previous game that seems really like that you come into it or and you tried those pretty equally red plus a passive he gets it he had the timed out and headed to write for that Scuttle crab I definitely also would have been pissed if I was the dunkler because you want to save time by letting the Red Bluff burn kill off just go grab me to walk away from it right now though getting a look at the in bed here from Xfinity on the go you got to believe I feel pretty comfortable right now is I can't even talk on the rest of the camp that was not was Gordie Johnson pretty solid and also kept impact safely went to the threat to seven broke his leg Yeah I mean they definitely do you win that to be do they want to keep up the pressure on the Troy to get your bottom to talk but once again we can see the bottom Lane has this small farm Lee Joins the Team Liquid Duo very threatening human touch on a little bit and Champion Select but the Zyra, I'm so potent early on a court date a of course was one of the stars for the team on the international stage as well you know I had a slow start I think most people were pretty much redeemed in their eyes 2000 G Series as well as a finishing up that term for difficulty and actually does run into for JJ I said and he's looking for the Deep Wards controller going down actually gives you an alert so they know he's there does getting time to rip recall actually get the recall off but just mean score JJ maybe what were you going to miss their whatever you do stay on the bottom side I should knock down the word or self I believe in regardless is 40 - 2 takedown now the rest of you is that you can as he's approaching level 624 the TSM side I would turn your eyes for say Szechuan e a r l e a combination irelia is able to set up the said why he passes so effectively she'd Dash in and also its best app for own done so there's just so many ways to see see a Canon who has very low lifes if you're able to land one that you can stain them effectively into a kill so I think that that is a very big point to can't text right now you can tell a Smithy also worried about this is the level 6 is are coming in right now that's where they kill pressure becomes extremely real Georgia's top with a broken plate search for 14 liquid impact with the slightest sidestep their Dodges the ultimate from broken play there is no cancer kill it was Liquid. Wayne first they find the first kill x movie still around now and actually not going to be any teleport left broken play head used as much as earlier that means even / plates on top of it that kill is more far-reaching than we initially thought EP down really make this so difficult all right Brooklyn play yeah I was in fact moving down he's just this is the ultimate there and that means there's going to be no countertop kits at Altima hid he can get the counter kill on to impact it's not quite as bad a situation still would be positive for Team Liquid in this world do that is going to be a very big group impact actually going to take that and go straight for the Proto belt he's not even going to go for he's kind of halfway point where we were seeing
Remax the third-place match Kiya Cloud 9 it was expecting to be the third best team for the top 50 North America to make it to world you heard invert us want to shake about doing that feels good to be back brake first game of Summer looking fresh already with the Draven band coming out on the side of Cloud 9 Donuts are combination also being broken up from the side of flyquest their Convent and drop them off as well if you want to point out JJ is still starting right now for it does mean that as we speak in North America has summer last year's they are now the same as to how to take a look at here and they have been very good for fly but but a pretty good year for them so far did I most likely do crack in the top three going towards world we did it you meet is dropped off the band list as well apparently knocked him in early appearance don't work then that's what I'm notbut it is silly driving to work on band on cloud nine side that you me and soda ban from 5 but yeah we can continue to update you on the bands while we're working on this a lot of support Focus I know surprised that you know the wreck on another one of those flashy initiators has been taken out but you mean we're super excited to know first of the games back in summer into the band bucket here at Champion a lot of people have been kind of on the fence about it and solo queue it definitely has to choose powerspec literally on poking in length is a lot of damage actually could have made support in that regard by the way has them band out by Cloud Nine answered by AJ's fan in here for the black Westside keep mine we are still on 9.10 here for Week 1 of the ALCS so all the 9.11 nurse such as the ones on 2JZ is it right now in this world who is Elaine engage support the galio with hot flashes with Ignite definition very strong combo for possible to V2 plays Saturday wild turtle and JJ longest and go in the North American LCS last spring I think there was a most underrated they consistently. Lane 2 V 2 killed by themselves so we can see how they do grow up here upsetting you on some more of the pics after the galio pics by Cloud Nine flyquest answered with the irelia and the rise aurelien rise was funny as we had been free game chat work about the riskier Banh Trang and toes are called Allie 1 and 17 irrelevant it be played in scrims do I enjoy that one also keep mine if you want to see his beating up on Danish mid laners European nna mid laners probe you spell out real quick check out for wealthier and maybe he'll have a good one there and this is going to be on as the final fix get rounded out in flyquest then grab Raffia a lot of it has been very similar with the super powerful flexible pics Porcello Lane being high priority Aurelia rise on one side stylist answering on the other died this is not a very big deviation from the international play that we saw on stage what is the New Horizon your game but it is 4 damn it. It's super scary when is a head right because you can reset the oil it not Reviving if you don't get the kill can sometimes me and you'll for junglers I do like to focus a track Lanes if they get behind early you can try and keep them behind and make it that way for the majority of the game so quick thinks of when I hear I know those bought the bottom and slightly cut off that is as real and Stage 1-e Band Away by C9 and Fibber and play stuff and Away by flyquest though stop robot Landmark seminar band and diet is grab right off the top gear as well to the lock that and even though when you work on his band earlier on it's going to be another late-game scaling Bieber recently booked as well help this dying for a wild turtle died in the last half-year even without the possibility of the rakan combination filled with so much power in the champion you got to mention a little bit earlier build very very easily into these print build and has a lot of Stacy from some of these dive tools with the ultimate hecarim also being locked in here very very powerful force been scaring that is going to be him on the warrior Trinity forest hecarim was a critical part of the C 9 strategy in Spring contact that guy that we expect I do want a slightly consider a truck still flexible Zekrom yeah I don't think it's going to happen to get paid. Top tech room jungle most likely but we have seen those Champs played in those other respect roast and now 500 that I made her debut here and there and then finally I think solidly in The Meta really a champion that's really good at diving verus by with a point-and-click with these low Mobility carries a good try and get that back line kill the Target by it's also quite good at snowballing Isabella Lane so vile irelia or Vive plus rised a very easy to execute kill combinations playing off the other ones crowd control absolutely tasty or get the Killer is the 241 up Top Lane could work very very well peppermints and the jongleur there in silence for this gives me to pick as well as I do want to take a tonight because this is been something has been taking over solo queue in very high rated game is the ignite headphones now undertaking ghost or Flash for that early first really game for oriented Summoner spell do so maybe not applicable to Pro play the look I'm getting right now in my chance that he moved over the ghost sadly not ignite but I think it'd be pretty hard to see as well there's always a chance and now that we are loading screen it is going to be closed tech room sadly out here otherwise nothing too out of the ordinary here in champ select DP on both mid laners 4759 doing two teams that have a good cry make Metro world number three and four teams in the last flick first game of summer we have a little bit of preparation your wild turtle on the diarrhea also taking clams in addition to the safety of the ultimate spacing of Galileo Lane quite a lot of possibilities here for use cases on that Summers bail if I have that read to you Auto W Auto all the things very easily trigger on Azazel Dahlia or even trades with the various if it got a Playa grow a lot of gold alright chant from both sides hike up in the crowd Cloud 9 fans very very sad of getting reverse sweat in Spring and flyquest we're so close moving further up in playoffs as well I'm at the correct that I am sorry that is a bug on the graphics of play right here on my screen it is lethal Tempo on this is it is not a love like the nephron that is a conqueror self soon enough but different please don't do what you're seeing on the screen right here if my expected refuse to believe to be believed this game and as we get ourselves out on this one let's see what these players have in store for us little ones have not been too aggressive nothing to outstanding happening right here is right for the jungle to start looks like buys going to be on the blue and a bottom side start for spent staring as well and remember now that we are on the new patches with the later Scuttle song lyrics are going with much more fuel level three beers do we do expect them to be forming up quite a bit more rather than going are those super early ganks Vian hecarim try to get a couple levels here so yeah they both just clearing out there besides and pulls from both Autumn Lane and they both get there a little bit late and Only One Mini Mystery air on the side of turtles and leave us episode one is doing be very easy tasty single-target camps out first The W very good for that though we going to get through this year I do like to pay attention to how the enemy teams are trying to track Gold junglers Anything. Both of the option of either rotating back down to the crugs or going over to blue side to start on the Wolves of likewise not completely sure if it's going to have a job to go over to the blue side going to finish up get that man origin of generation it done first and santorin does a full blue size clear device that you start machete it's much easier to do the camps that have left markers in them to go pick up the Red Bluff and we might see some movement here that's still a long time away so maybe even want to fight each other just yet just out of the trunk right there and now the sacrum is there to fight Center on push off and we'll lose a couple of small Raptor that's why I think that one but it's pretty risky here cuz you could be the reason to Thorne goes back in full Beltre has more Health in the mid lane but nisky had shoved a wave Inn and also was rotating over to the side so go snugglers kind of pull off of that fights in curing was not chased out there it's just you still had enough in the tank to the threatened following that roam you got to go crab it's fine just about 20 seconds ago and I was going to go to Spanish no problem at all and now we do have ourselves the other top total being taken everything from you as well as fence for infant have no meeting at 1 so it will be a trade but I'm pretty means one thing but the other side of that means another these numbers on a fairly similar Farm count would be quick at the top when it's + 4/4 y Pesca start for him mottling play the advantage for sneaky in laying alongside please a pretty good spot for the wave your on topside for licorice to is holding it right in front of the Tower so we might see some junglers called over to help push this up Viper work for himself does feel a little bit risky heck Roma is definitely a depth at coming through four leg aches because he talks can set him up with a small knock ups but it looks like we're going to have 10 tornados by hovering around too far away and you could delay enough to live able to use that to jump right back out of this infernal chains and no harm there either the Topps go to helping and yeah he was okay and not get tonight too much when you finally get that recall off double longsword in for Viper and the other pieces of the p.m. at One allowed so what helps us as well as we can say recalls off in the jungle has red spots for both books all right so currently then the telephone Advantage is still held by liquor if she's not gone back to purchase female Viper with the extra-long stores in inventories going to have that combat potency that I have to watch out a little bit on the side there meanwhile book junglers with the challenging Smite I do expect some early combat hear from from both of those guys they do get very very powerful level 6 All In all right though we are just waiting there was a chance of the early aggressive so far haven't seen it just yet you seen by her play free safety saw both busy and his W-4 there not many of the top five. Could we go out from JJ's Brown Deer as well and doubt taking down the old as he goes for the dive remember licorice had not purchased it was on the level 1 items are on all power comes from the flag Quest support as JJ was headed towards the bedside so sometimes you need a hold back a little bit this game though fireworks already fireworks Indiana to get back in the land do want to point out that of course be top link skills weren't for the fact 404 first why but if you mention TC Advantage I believe we're going to burn it just now shove in part of a wave so that hundred gold cost for losing that fight really on me taking off my pole vaulter I wish they had a little bit earlier licorice get some Revenge with a ROM down that was nice of a tipi difference status what happened are wronged in the mid top season 2 fight Viper will avenge do well through this pain inside edition 49ers disconcerts gain when on a dual rub into the enemy's jungle three-week want that topside fight again yeah I mean you talk about a little bit earlier but I hate rocks not going to be able to have your bubble 5 or earlier one going for on Aurelia this is what prompted the initial dive that got us all hyped up before ashes for it actually think level 6 on that three play number two on trying to walk back to Lane at little bit greedy on that inside or out hit on smoking the wall they're allowed it he's he's done for Viper being up against the wall already using the dash method no way Liquors could Dodge that's done and it allowed by perks to go for the all-in now
mobility of this Champion creating chaos sharing gold changing matchups and we are in a champions for the last we are in the game 1 of the NBA Finals Team Liquid taking on G2 Esports and what shocks me already was he was on the receiving end in 96% of their game of the Tariff and it's sealed themselves actually dropping off the table so I take that back we do have the car so it is G2 with the galio the tack and the rise band fascinating do they actually look to take that one away typically when we could playing on the right side on to denying that rise take away from their oppositesso successful for G2 so it's so weird to see each team batting those two Champions out and leaving up the junglers but take a look and there is going to be the first one blocked in so much success drive this tournament that have the ability to make the early games impact on the different lanes and again I want to reiterate the rabbit has been updated shoes blue stripe for game one as was there right at the higher seed this is Wonder taking the job and bring it out of that prioritizes outside of the map in the semi-finals that usually went through the Solace into jungle pick was that be the wreck side the job and and sometimes even this Ghana but this time I not have Lisa gets through the galley should be the priority to the midgame invite is a huge part of the identity of Team Liquid speaking of identity going to log into Skynet this was the champion that he used to get that full steam victory over Invictus gaming taking it into the right side of buying a lot of success and I think Team Liquid Spigen want to go Tom can share cuz they were afraid of these iatric on Duo and they have the option to pay recana very big pic for Mickey X looks best when he is on the grass so we can go forward start the team fights perks of course really good on this is alongside of the player when he was a minute later would still play Sia and get funnel on it certainly a lot of expertise was camping this is a from your bottom line for the second round couple of power Pick 3 or 4 g2a biggest moments for this player has been on that can create other reasons babies are kind of alluded to possible way from Tom came after the recording you know with a charm up you can collect multiple members who does have to be a little bit careful of the burst damage coming out of the other side and often times will see teams that are against work on especially in the mid lane grass some of that first name if you're trying to kill him upon initiation because that is the weakness of the champion bit squishy I'm looking to take away some of the safe takes that impacted Austin defaulted to the cannon being the main one they may look to take away the Gangplank but he didn't actually played a single time in a best-of-five again Invictus gaming we'll see what she look to take away off the board maybe they look to take away Jensen singer or if they consider a big threat considering as well if we are going to see Mages the route in the mid lane here once on a band for G2 Esports how good is there homework what do they think Team Liquid woodpec to best round out the composition of Vladimir is off the table at impact Elite plays long-range face laners who don't need help to get away from the one be Tuesday and then Flank In the team fights the Cannons the bladder and the Nikko all prime pick for him are gone exactly those big ability 14x have been the common thread in Impact pics of a couple of last bands they're on the side of G to try and take that away but it goes right back to where he started in the group stage in fact the single best performing player of the liquid Gangplank was a Mainstay tries to save space on the top side in a big difference between gameplay and they can endure Vladimir is that the ultimate can be committed without having to use your telephone to the other side of the map now we see the Swain coming out from G to expectations all of this will be put up towards the top side this is something we saw from here last year and was a very common ancestor thing like the Jeep in the forecast this came out yesterday against the side of cats and he was able to have a huge amount of impact on the counter pick possibility here for Jensen in the middle and give him the reason for their win over IG was Camp rookie he's a good player he can carry us through that strategy did work and now how is Saint Vincent's number one signature pick is here in game 1 of the final figure from G to such a good defense against Garner make it so you don't have to pay those qss packs is quite as quickly and quite as Focus their the Black Shield such a good defense all free will see how they get through the early game here because again my eyes turned towards the top side this Wayne picked for G2 seems to be one of the most advantageous points my expectations that both teams that she looked to invest a lot of resources outside the map I wouldn't be surprised to see Yankers that you make a level to play and see if they can fight off the Cyrus on The Voice for yank us will he go for the bottom side like you're talking about or try and dive the gangplank I got to see after game 1 of Champions left a best-of-five there are at least two more drastic of we're hoping it goes all the way to that face game is on the 10 players hands now you hope the guidance you gave him was enough you hope their practice got them ready for this event this will be the first ever major championship for North America in the first free Europe since 2011 G2 are the new ones the hole that mantle in Europe in Team Liquid or Built For This and we are on to the Riff that headless trophy in that soft lanes that head will be replaced at the conclusion of his peers of one of those immortalized by 2019 I didn't want to rebel in a couple more seconds for the fact that merely us being here now in this finals D2 and Team Liquid have for the entire competitive League of Legends theme into a paradigm shift u n n a fighting for everything upgrade my Mac O B I like it according to the W is coming up soon they could look for play unspooled a date. Flash Barry early on questionable decision making that from call JJ waiting in the members are coming to get washed and then having to blow your flash for it North America already on the losing end your of the level one but t l Osborn Lane will be able to get priority in this to visit Cuba and Mickey. Assist in terms of the early jungle advantage that she called it in Dublin right now gang cosas in the river right now settled funds in a few seconds he's already next that brush as well if there is a game to be had and we saw towards to it's not going to be to selfie but if there was a way would be there meanwhile Xfinity clears out the Red Bluff and the rapper tip for heading into the top side Scuttle they will trade after the Visions been given over looks like it's headed towards the Scuttle crab to try and content and does not have the support of his Lanes he has the damage though and with it being stunts metal do bonus damage gets it out before is opposing Junction show up in 53 how often we see the topping was pushed in expectacion is for this match of the exchange of going for the possibility of an early gank look just trying to get down to the felt pads for sale for Yankees versus Mets immediately on Spiner you can annihilate so stay away camps even early on that while you'll notice is that one that running the rest of the undying rosin be typical klepto so we often see a full swing pics for the reason for that is because of how impact lights to PlayStation. It can be difficult could you every now and then you try and hit me with your cue while fun fact I'm going to hit you with mine and you can see how every single time one that's coming out ahead in this place has already passed out as well good training as a g to do oh yeah and good Focus their you want to continue to attack the Tom kench there's no flash Encore JJ as well as whittling down the health bar if you can get through the potions then you can do so much work pressuring and forcing them to lose the edge control word go down for Xfinity in order to clear out some of the G2 Vision but because the bottom line for G2 was able to push their they also get the spires Moon plant and information on the enemy jungler swear about all three lanes right now the Madonna has consistently pushed up in this one versus one it's very difficult for many Mages to trade against the mold because you see the toilets swirl it goes down it pulls the push and the black shield means that you're often going to lose out on these small trades in the way the fact that the level 1/4 Jensen to corrupting potion charges very early on took 90% of his how far end damage off the Invaders from D2 currently we're having a bottom from Yanko in that fog of War right now and he's an upright right there so there is a plate of you had if you're not going to believe it because they playing towards the back of slowest remember there is no security has happened to focusing on that weakness that they opened up in the level one attacking corejj no flash on that's on catch first but 42k we see the setup janko's comes in from the lane double at the Gorge expected to be present to the river which is why they were bringing down and notice how they completely ignore what you were just saying it Cody wanted to let themselves first one Dan Katz walking up past the minion fear I don't look right to throw out the arrow get the flash off of the 80 karrie as well great fly out of G through have a custom Dallas well there's no Ward on the target with Logan's in the back and it looks like for now we see free call pedrito can't be stopped there are more than a prostrate positioning that from corejj to keep his 80 carry alive 6 Minute mm is 2 goal lead as they find multiple successful trade with caps does for the shield on a lane with a disaster for Team Liquid that has gone on the bottom side key to our continuing to keep up his pressure double it's on the war here Kidde recall up with AJ still far up in the lane so as soon as it complete Kinkos in PDX know they can go for this and notice how close to Atlanta to just go back to base and Wanda is waiting for the potential TPS impact immediately comes in at this point xmithie an impact realize they can't play split apart and they get away with what minimum one member because doublelift does not have teleport on the berit and they forced him back to base so even if teleports go off they will always be answered and she too is able to take advantage of those numbers and I'll get you a key West woah push the start of the game system so I am at Safeway's constantly getting harassed and is full so kind of plan to his current he's not. Overextend without a flash against a level six swaine that already has a very big disadvantage in 1500 gold up watching the trade name on the bottom side yet again it is a relief for the DL side of things but to kill sound of a lot more on 1st and we now have your temper stop playing now comes the cage on top without Flash no easy way out right back trying to run now we're just yet but you're going to play in Ultimate and it might just have the damage always running for dear life, Foresthill of the game Jayco staying on the warpath here because of the bottom Langston and again no flash on impact and he immediately goes to attack it your point it out so wave in a very bad spot pushing away from it games like with no flash is taken down
Champion Select the trophy on the line for the North American or European Champions and when their own blue side in the same way they can afford to give it a priority by the guarantee that strong jungle matchup Richmond definitely wear how it all had started Tarik is also going to be banned near it again on the other side here's the nose do natera games will make their way into the finals yet already Elsa with Silas still up and available to look spry about realizing what they need to take from this tournament to add to their own stuffto really make a new Team Liquid and they want to still rely on those team fighting and those drooping towards the mid-game however if they also talked about wanting strong matchups that will allow and enable some early action from a Smithy well big Japanese black alert a collie Silence by Colleen south of course very important as well if you look at say Okay Jensen on D call Hugo can still go to impact I want to cast onto Jensen his akali and efficiency in the first Jensen during the Crusade has struggled on both side of the Mansion I am proud of Jensen and Team Liquid to be able tothe confident that take this again but I am also a bit cautious and some of the learnings and takeaways for Team Liquid the Conqueror Rune change the build change I'll be at those become a factor as theirs has been locked in for G2 and take it away from Team Liquid the timing right now is do they do pestana alrex eye or do they just looked and looked at the Lock in the bot Lane by then there's going to be an answer with this guy on it but if you go to the store just to have something else that is prepared so they decide to walk in that boat by in here and this gives the freedom to choose walking right side cuz I'm a can of course immediately bad guy here in exchange for a strong bottomley match if they know that bottom line will be targeted they will Whittle down doublelift champion pool here to compete with the bottom size because thatis what was exploited in the last game yet there was a level one there was a flash blown but that is where the game was made for the side of Team Liquid in the mid game they can look for G2 often try to split up the map of God and see if there are windows were they can find these tools and full control of the game I hear of course you got decent jungle pics would you two can keep Banning away junk has one side to look at a force can start pushing way supports for Mickey X the other one is we talked about how cracking ankles and stopping those really going to be important ice can do that outside of the Jungle roll with hot shot try to track the wrecks I say okay she's topside we're okay to play aggressive bottom side has to be recalled and put them in and walked over in danger down here and it gives me to play around one of the most annoying thing so it has taken off the boardmy expectations are the less you look to try and grab them did they know right now could be to lasondra even be something alarm I told you about fresh I think it's something that Mickey has play the DS come out during the regular season Pike is another option that he could go for depending on how aggressively they want to play sealed game 5 with Pike in the can and there's a decent chance we see that his magic dust Team Liquid blink and say we want to play that how do you turn will actually come up in this Champions the way what will Team Liquid answer with they have to Blind for impact that could bring up the pike still away I thought it was so effective against the kennet and it's unable to punish the Pike in Lane even with the rain Advantage because pipe with a passport can back off fuel up and pipehas an all-in threat to the Bone skewer as well as the mobility of the champion well part of what helps G to win that match up is a lot of pressure and a lot of skanks from the mid length and from the jungle going up there constantly a great earlier from G2 Esports is there counterfeit into range matchups and it's a lot of pressure from asking me about Champion Select throughout yesterday and my number one responds so much for the versatility of this team but you know the gold-bearing later on becomes a factor of the executed such a big part when you cough up with other possible sources of first damagejust have a funny story for you I was talking to make you this morning I was like is today the day you get to prove you're the best player on the team he's like I hope so I really hope you can see right now is I'm fine as long as I get to play another hook champion in the threshing we spoke about take the tension on the side of Team Liquid there is so much Mobility who potential potential rather on the side of this be truthful as well.all right pressure is on for game two of us who if I was North America versus Europe in the seven split they've been in Europe most dominant team of Europe the last three and a half years that is unquestionable and it could bring home yours first trophy since 2011 due to its is the new run for them seem like we were built for this game to European continent right now free throw looking at this bike seesaw game one day I feeling excited and then looking forward to seeing what they can do up against Team Liquid who have tried to attack coming as a game so I do think they should be hyped lineup batting cap perks the captain of the team willing to change lanes and they still find success take a look at the invade do Olaf alwaysgives you priority with the Axeman that combined with Brom is basically a win in a level one Skirmish so we're trying to take looks here while on the top side of your math U see two members of Team Liquid trying to cover that pixel brush and dispersed a little bit late trying to match the early aggression that G2 demonstrated last game but she to ask you showing a lot of respect staying in darkness trying to avoid all of the vision so that his starting point is unknown to expanded yeah recognizing the fact and Olaf on the enemy team with most other iOS Vale as well as incredibly powerful as far as level one they know they have no place to testing it so they don't get themselves into a dangerous spot looked over the jugular two-year-old you may not have seen him quite a while probably should have been easily clear for himself are we start here on the Raptor camper as you can see what the Talisman start no problemwhat alarm is on the right side and she started on his blue immediately transferring into the Grump which means that he should have information on way to get enemy jungler is now because pokes and Mickey came to light a lane rather late you'll also notice that Jensen is actually adapted cappza's akali build going full the Conqueror and likely picking up the Landry's later on so that when they move off to a side length of the account become an extended trip for those things we touched on learning from your opponents and see what was victory over the wedding world champions IG Benson walks in Lux into the Zoe matchup learning from the North American LCS finals yet again here at the hands of caps learning from the akali side of the Silas monchi and you can hear from just more than us as shocktober G tooz coach after the draft reportI just got a chance to catch up with Gtunes coach a grab that I forgot them about team morale obviously I forgave Lonnie said it's the same as before we're not getting overheated we were confident and we still are and of course ask him about the pike pick once again I ask him is it's not just going to be the standard for you guys you said no it's still very situational and in this case it just works out very well. 80 Carey has no dash so it is a perfect pick them also what he found about thiel's composition he said well nothing to be surprised by this is a typical Team Liquid composition and if they don't get to leave early they don't win the game so he's feeling pretty confident about this oneEncompass the bottom line is double shutdown a 200 hp do flight attendants rest for Yanko could go for big Floyd Another flag Pin Oak Court JJ II First Blood match beautiful landed by Mickey to set up the play on to double if absolutely beautiful execution that she to boost blood once again it may be questioned to the best pike on the team is but no question who the best threats on the team is Mickey again getting a lead on the bottom side of the map for G2 is the one that picked up the first blood on this wreck site everyone knows how devastating is Champion can be a now he's looking to release some pressure meancomes out and forced out by Captain like a parent to get sticky and it landed here we see keep your eyes on Mickey and notice how he goes in between the minions just as it dies double is past the wrong way he gets hooked underneath the Panic why he doesn't take a towel shock the damage is already done which means that he's supposed to flash early and then call JJ has to give up his life so that his 80 calorie can survive but that's three out of. Bojangles to look for potential flight once again ball thing as wellwhat did you do my quit looking at jankovsky flash live in chest pain is on the board but now it's restored your day you will be shut down as well as you answer back on the akali one kill for silence on the situation jail new expected while the display to come out they had three people all the moving towards midline position and they knew that the rights I have no class cuz he was the immediate so they were able to come out on top in expecting with you I've looked Hooks and I text remember that extra bit of damage enables you to defend it into one another look at it and it goes on the right side still staying underground so he does get the Ping to Sea-Tac Smithy and corded are arriving before JJ makes the dash in to start the action here and in which RV Cleburne onyango ticket the first killthat's correct. It doesn't have a flash because he went bottom side and killed the prom taking the Brahms flash as well before JJ also no way out of the fight and mid laners both get killed and noticed Mickey did not use his Lantern she try and save Yanko she made the decision in the moment to try and bring put into the fight they realized my jungle or is already gone rather than try and save him lights redeem the situation by there if you want to point out that Justin has yet to back he still holding on to his teleport Landing as long as he can for a later bigger power Spike there is finally item coming through that is a Cutlass and if he has better item so far is Mid length and despite the extra kill for G2 because of a cannon on the top side with klepto you can see the Team Liquid actually slightly more gold still a lot of it and Spacall Matt Kennon match up though I know what's interesting here is that yesterday when we Wonder playing his bike into Conn's 10 and it was actually surprisingly even I think a part of that was Tom wasn't familiar or used to the match up with the cannon into pipe here we seeing a lot more confident play from the side of impact not only does that show his confidence on the tenant but it also shows that he's been paying a lot of attention to how one that plays despite these or somewhere where the Jungle the tension is going he knows a lot of folks around the outside of map to become book to play aggressiveBlue Cross Lanes right now it's Cheerleading full across-the-board the first blood for Yanko Santa's do bikes with these extra Farm being Olaf most is Goldie 40 L is in the top Lane this almost 23s lead for impact expected base the match up again the way it flips is getting pressure from your other teammates and I'll be washed and Jensen fight off back and forth and he steals you walked away in the wings here threatening to turn that one V one upside down and kept back off right close to you can see the break point for this Silas vs. akali Matthew once you get the gunblade in particular when she gets that Leandra said she'll be in a much better position but in the interim with cats having that level six and having a couple more items under his belt is coming out of head in a lot of these folks right opportunity to die of a little bit into those adjustments that cat showed in this matchup that sentence will probably be learning from you know they are game is over time adjustment
haven't where you had double of tell Jensen I will get you that LPS title and I will get you out of fruits in here they are doing what many thought impossible for North America only making a shot at winning a horse that looks like things are going to remain the same for the side of you two both gallion taken off the board priorities like they're going to be the job and once again depression is how old can liquid pivot will they continue to take the return of the boat was Silas be the priority for job and be taken away it's off the table not really really good trade a jongleur for a solo Lane pick and it will be dropping taken away this looks like the exact same draft that I can remember from game was driving off the table and 50 most fun a jungle you likecan I change of what in their bottom latest might be more late game with that type of hover lot of mine has been such a focus for this series so far me to have had the advantage back-to-back games down there for the SS on the Kaiser once again very comfortable camping for him & Stitch onesies 4X Missy's will be the front line does have the possibility of for Spartan gauges torch on Statue don't care what they going to have to dance with the calliope that thinking well to be honest you put nothing that can handle is now there is one right now they would like to go. She going to be the fire in the middle and I look for counters in other lanes not just in the lane with work on something I thought was going to come through last time around trying to take advantage of the weaknesses of rakan I am sometimes we will be Champions like that towards the midline actually focus on killing him on the engagesbut not so far if we get the LeBlanc actually opens up even more possibilities for liquids do you get that Spindrift liquid draft for ek221 scheme by a little bit of scaling. Outside of the map but they still provide a lot of value I know they can round to draft out with Mages in the middle name as you already talked about Kobe and they can save that for the final pick as well so to me it feels like liquid in this game 3 it looks like they're saying we want to play a 33-minute team fight fear they remove a team fight made from casting Noah's here you can't help Gala to the mid lane we get first dibs I want to see if it's bendre or less Bond reform or engaged to the indexed even more than doubled being on the damage off with a towel storage sheds Juana Diaz set up we'll see what comes through a lot ofthe place are on the table the only can send a Team Liquid is all they over stacking on a pee damage there is a lot coming through on the side and he got on my bike I said while being an ATP canceled the chat a lot of it. So the question is what direction do they go blind if you don't Libras really like Beyond hit Nico supposed to be a good matchup into that was very good. That could be in a slice of champion first they take the Nikko they expect of Latimer I think I could be on his way here we'll see what the second pick from B2 is going to be around it out currently they have a lot of speed for their engaged not a lot of taking it so it has to be execution faced the thing that the hovering theright now I expect you to come through yet I think this will grow in the hands of TAPS in the mid lane I'm expecting them to you lies the high mobility and the level 6 hole in potential that are really it does provide not only provide more ID damage to the squad but also do you want the main Dynasty against trying to attack the early and often with Rome from your jungler and your support Darvin and rakan will Triana citarelli up and getting killed on to that bendre early on in the game now we know this seems pretty well it's not allowed to the final game of a 0 / Team Liquid go to North America in Back to the most comfortable stylishthe biggest thing a TL have to be cautious off the early game from the side of G2 Esports even though it is harder to play tolls about side of the map of the games and Alice. Do not be surprised level 450 Mickey going back to Rolling Meads grouping up with you and then kill exactly I expect a lot of effort towards Wards around the river and the river leading chords mid lanemy phone is out of the trophy only one of these canals look pretty heavily that it supports from Europe to the International Champions as well begin this house in the first few sloppy splits and then a world semifinal eating orange with an MSI file no chance the trophy to beat Team Liquid that is one of that has m coming right up to see how things pan out in this game through the pressure is on Team Liquid a lot of hopes rest on the shoulders let's see if they can bounce back exactly Team Liquid you mention any championships OG to but this team has had a similar percentage of success with three championships list to their name sent franchising steam liquid has only no success in the North American LCS and now in the finals on the international stage this is their chance to prove that what they were built for not to be exactly that what they whoop that's the biggest thing that I'm looking for a team liquid we know they have the potential to battle the best we know that they can upset world champions let's see if they can do it today as work on that sneaky level one place is made it into this project committee has no idea 650 taking a lot of space which nickels Wheels fall off CC of flag of all going to land here and we'll show him a bit low is he keeps ticking Halo actually from Jarvan trade those bells go with junglers both burning flashes just me it's a little bit of vision of the end learn Bloomin birth natal plus the Keystone toy store Wonder means it is going to be 18 if you as you called him out and not the wits end ruined Kingdom Rush 4 on hit damage it will be a lot of magic damage gigantic team fight ultimate sin Wonder can definitely counter engagement seal tries to do today once again unless they should be able to get Paris on the lane and they're already going to start the push-up very valuable a game designer Raton and I do often like the outfit and silicon pick because every time the Recon tries to go in humidity going to get it something you always have to show respect the game which means that this was Nicki and Brooks coffee as aggressive as they would like to play aggressively you know what you can if your jungle shows up at level to level 2 off of red is able to get the heel first out of + 2 letting the damage of the EQ there and then also getting flag that is true Summoner spells once again early on Accessory ankles early Yangtze might be thinking but will not take that trade like screw pops on to him there's one right behind as well that is not a fight to be had no top Scuttle is the battle level 2 on both the sides that go take him to Camp Mickey looks a fight now I know Smite for a Smithy while Yankovic's does has he have himself but no chance to get that Scuttle crab and Caicos is going to hold on to this might and just Auto it down they felt level 3 leasing some Minion XP helps that a lot as well as if he is both shuttles here for that Red Bluff just been spotted level 1 play on the offensive Reynolds they do have the summoning spell advantage ss still only level 1 as you post about freaking Business Bureau has really struggled throughout this dude so much focus and put on the trying to shut down before everybody has EQ available. We found them at TLC has a take what formed a candy people 23 to 10 in CS down here bottling is getting smashed into the brush here for the gang goes doesn't have vision of the he'll be sticking around now still threatening the DL bottom side. It has been left by himself if they go to looking for the engagement GTV Sports three games in a row first and once again G to successfully shut down SS there making the series impossible for him to play and I'll capsules look in a fight chance and we'll keep after winning trait do you know his whereabouts at Smithy sitting at the counter will it be a information there with the war that goes past is over 6:50 for the counter play in Team Liquid get something out of Midland jungler down and this is the best situation for Team Liquid to be an officer that early to have sit-down boss try and get Jensen ahead turn this into something that can carry the game or Team Liquid on the bottom side of her go back to the roots of an easy dipping gate now is mechanical not put himself in his own and Gates this game right now only three it is a reasonably close we can watch that Midland bank again yeah right over the World Vision there so then you call a committee and it is to be a flash Spotify double if they found where did they must run away there are no other way we just watched out doing what he can to try and help his Lane is on the top side of the map but it's nothing he can do about the bottom side, just barely put on a rampage throughout summoner's rift top to bottom now we still keeping up a PS4 but it is still waived exactly the biggest difference does not have teleforce so that is a ton of experience Rampage came into another successful trade and Performing just now we get to see what happened to doublelift stuff / knocked up coming through from Mickey went double it still has no stomach has failed us from the love is do it was too much for double if the handle any chance of getting shut down to sleep been insane this series for G2G two people expected the bottom line to be their weakness but they've turned it into their strength with attention from Yanko in the early game perks and Mickey have been out there. He's also a Mickey is also fighter that post has given so much credit for what this guy has been one of the most consistent while the highly rated players in support of a position in Europe and he's brought know what to do to his share that moment with her experience read Mickey is definitely an experience Team Liquid you to Rally around Jensen in the Midland the syndrome with the kill level seven cool down on the ultimate coming back up this is a possible point for them to get kills at smithing is here find better damage cap still not choosing to go forward there they don't find us opening is that mean you walk 7 light reveals locations busy trying to hide away they still don't have the cool down I said there's old backup from here to find the QE nice Juke by Kathy will be hit a little bit while he's not going to play around with single-handedly is the best mid laner in Europe maybe the people who cannot buy an advantage and a Gentleman top lights everywhere is an absolute Slaughter here Tri to dominating all points of the map Jensen he goes for comfort with the syndra team liquid try to play through midday in but they cannot lockdown caps the beautiful side steps for dogs to start getting some for himself and then throwing out the ultimate to get multiple products of the QI enabled him to catch
you have proved in the LPL this year they played their team owner only our team is absurd Buffalo sports are going to head right now and I have to tell another fun story before we get into the game and it is very much about the last time the Buffalo Zoo Buffalo actually what I want make me laugh was coming to the game the two teams has like a buffalo please don't take belt off of the games that they had at Worlds meliodas back in the starting lineupI had played the first four games the Mainstays Chevy Prizm 01 Ford not start they want it so he is back and ready to go at least overall was the main starter throughout almost the entirety of the BCS G2 of course we know from them new in the roster Mickey X to do with the roster first down to the bottom Lane and they have looked incredibly sharp three-in-one so far poised to go for him like that I think one of the areas that a lot of people are looking for for 6s or the Farms will Buffalo is that bottom Lane trying to get do Korra and palate off to a very good start to the day can try and take over well Turks and good in Lane there are opportunities for them to punishfor the side of G2 throwback to last year but no surprise that you would go for the Papas missing it made the same in yesterday that he believes Jesus proof are in fact that utilizing rice not just because of their ability to play the sepoy mutiny on the roster but so far along with a strong fault line in the temperature later on Rockside plenty of the front line damage off with an ultimate so as well what's that between both caps and Rise so they can outsideon the side of GQ where they can actually make early moves he's going to be very big for them standing up for that mid-game because that would be the area where funds will clear all ahead trying to get that early advantage and get those gold leaf rolling I can follow any heart valve control removed from the auction bear make sense to help keep whatever backliner alive or that's either the soul into playing rise or first on whatever Market he's going to play with her calm down a silly reason to pick something like a diet because she has a little bit of that sell steel to see what actually comes through here caixa off the tables or Calista off the table if we look back at what I did it would be a very to get rid of has come through I'm looking at a potential thresh maybe he has gone to things like thisthe pike as well as kind of Narrows and something a little bit more aggressive in This concerns me a little bit with the draft directions that going forward to Kaiser if something seems a lot I don't think that she's the strongest one be to Camp something like an Israel that could be our which means that it could be a situation with hot on a rolling his the entire gets annoying and I definitely could be difficult they could still do go with a range support like a Morgana that's a lot of pain and the black shield who's plays in Europe to bring it out and as a region someone has a high priority pick all the way up until even during the playoffs but it's definitely a farm Focus jungler but super good against low Health enemy Target collie caixa and recs I will all feel that cost is Ultimate later on in the gameis actually the choice here picked up I think the expectations from the side of g to oz at the Academy will be going through small plane but either way I think they can do well against something white and irelia I think that you have to be very cautious as that level six. The world around from the side of the road are my expectations are on the side of like the dive support that they have been able to draft here in the last two picks up a gentle on top of a Collie with Oriana or adding extra damage does provide a really good punch in a possible win condition here for the Buffalo that you have to really good primary Delivery Systems you meant to be a call either Rectify of course as well if you landed Frey sneaker you're flying right back where you hit and all the rest of them can all follow through so it aggressive team fight heavy backline killing companies near for funds with Buffalo G2 Esports one that does fit what he kind of needs. He doesn't kill one of the last letter is to look are there still arise and if it's your fault of those used to Lucien there's a lot of damage up here available on a well-rounded there of course I 131 T Morelli and Rhys both good at that as well so be looking for these teams have played their wind conditions played their play Styles and I've come to the fitting these teams has is wengie to typically play things like the coffis it's not until the making a 10 to 15-minute box where they really start to kick in together usually pay the early game of the first 10 minutes remind me to pay bills in early advantage to try and get ahead before the contest of Champions early on can exactly where the enemy jungler is and then you just walk in and get the rain flow with your wall but it's not from that you do have to play very Walk This Way is ready to go on if the last game of the first round robin you're in the middle of day three of the group stage here at MSY a G2 Esports a have been a pleasant surprise for lease I need to run through expectations here for the European Fanta there's three and one beating SKT in the opening game funds with Buffalo a team they are now expected to meet based on current form in a foreman run with it later on fight against IG is going to be telling people going to be watching for with the g2 Squad regardless they are here to give one of your best performances that a messiah see this team has pretty upset in the past we already talked about wolves last if they were able to get a movie to win against you to eat a lot of what we seem from them in this tournament is that they found early these they actually found kill advantages gold advantages but then they make that one crucial mistake and the end up floundering and everything starts to fall apart Wii sword against the flash. We saw a couple times it seemed liquids in the plain states and we just kind of want to see them convert those early advantages into an actual game with this little one not as spicy as the last 2 IGG games we had seen it it's going to be a bit slower here is caps and na will do a bit of battle here in the mid lane is a farm and this is one we did talk about it in the draft wet irelia against Ariana little weak in the early learning face Colby irelia Jennifer Sparks Mickey's not going to knock at their first Glen's got here you could have got the damage up for the kill a level 1 Class Auto for the plasma text is quicker free 2 minutes into the game we're talking about the bottom of the phone booth Buffalo they find it to be to kill Thicke ex did not get the dog back on his Justice by swell first was haunted for ecstatic did not claim them flashlight and he goes down does have displayed so you can see him moving aggressively Landing that unless you identify as a just a function not connecting to help by the field going to get this kale but it's still a forestry called double Summoners out of the G2 support that the only one up is that single cleanse for a person bottom length is massive ear for PVP really has been that stand out for them at this tournament will do what they can do because the lead from the bottom side if you can get your shine to level that is transferable then and it really does put a stop to a lot of those all in place. They have priority in both did and this is allowed meliodas to invade into the enemy jungle and steal away from to Buffalo solution take advantage of a wall he doesn't go for it Stop & Shop in the recall here they've got Yang Coast in the backside if they go for Yankovic's, he's going to get stop how far is it from all the way around to stop being critical of G2 Esports that was an overconfident play kooda just flashed out he could have just in case but instead chose another lands if you have the support room and look at this it's so tough forecast over the Oriana ball into the queue to try and get away meliodas actually taking power a Girl by hitting The Fray Secor and flashing forward no finish it off the kill do and then he Dodges the critical Q are also mangoes in that situation because he was even though he was planning to use on the meliodas is also hitting minions so the reduced Dental damage was not enough to find that kill and now the fault line continue trays going between the two dogs one comes up and then walking away make you not able to make that trade look too good do want to point out that person has gone equal in farm despite the death despite the summer disparity he is still farming just fine if the kill matters in that gold is relevant but delete otherwise keeping a bit equal looking to see what round two might be down here over all this game S40 in the Wild by goodness stuff on Buffalo are Standing Tall today continuing to throw out these place so aggressive in finding the rewards even making his way down towards the Middle Lane but the Buffalo they bringing meliodas for today's game in the primaries for the first two days but so far his early pressure with the right side and three of the four killed and I'll make you could take all at once again young girl with a 5-0 in 6 minutes which supports on the road pallet find the time to your once again getting Mickey and another killed over to the Buffalo was picked up by Rex size of a bounty on his head that is something that is fairly risky cuz rek'sai she is definitely a bursa Bowl champion but my goodness that is going to help with the snowball to get in early Warriors and a burst damage is insane and I want to see phone through Buffalo keep Snow bowling this bleed they are in such a perfect position for they've been in this position many times before I get as many clothes as you can build up what advantages you can't afford the cost at it's a level 6 boss and I'm going to look back at Mickey does it really react with enough cuz I think that you two were probably had their eyes and an offensive look they're looking for the place they wanted free on Midland and probably just walks up Elaine to talk and the follow-up there once again for PVP and I'll fight forward control and probably knocked that one down controller goes their way as we take a moment the one point of strength D2 is winning topside Wonder with the rise pic into a collie does have a huge Advantage up there on the top side or calling now approaching l o six point but I guess Big Carl take them down 03
is IG simply playing with that food or does IG look sloppy joe sides when you look at was last year they dropped two games The Fanatic and then they made the run all the way to the world files looking extremely convincing so few always have to be afraid of what's the left in the IG text me the scariest thing about yesterday's game their 16-minute victory over SK Telecom wasn't even how quick it was it was at the stars of that game where the jungler and the bottom lamp that is not what people used to praising about Invictus gaming winners the absolute Peak players the Cheyenne rookies gods of their positions but it was Ming and Jackie love on display with some very interesting pics with a Camille and Draven coming out so I'm always very excited to see what this team will draft absolute they are incredibly impressive of the Bands almost done here we can talk a little bit about Flash those here of course it's his the big story is the rebuilding year when to two star players went overLPL this year and it's okay what can Flash rules do as an organ that never miss the semifinals of MSI right now they are on the outside looking at they do need to play a bit better IG will be a great starting point would be phenomenal would be great we have to remember this class was had a fantastic game yesterday when they played up against me to open the game going in favour of The Flash also feels like this they are gradually ramping up throughout the twin of my things ravva is getting better and better and now we look at the draft things like the ride and the akali are we going to take the akaliyeah with a stylus band out here no surprise idea me delete will take the leftover arrive for themselves such a potent power pick for the squad definitely threatening a top or mid and they also get for the premier support galio in the bottom side with Tom kench already banned off the table provides so much playmaking I would also really love to see an odorless come out from the side of plants will we see multiple teams pick it up as an answer and the it goes through the food away and you couldn't end up in a situation likenow bro I'm locked in here certainly, Gretchen's and mail it got near the BOK close by as he Kelly Hansen gel paired up together and that's still a hug right now on this guy said it was going to pick us even want to do with your last pic and that's not locked in I mean again is Gentile I personally am just not on the bandwagon here for their sin Sal big especially into something like a Leo does make it kind of hard for a champion wins since I was basically has One Direction going in with the team v a gallon is a really good answer. If he can make use of the pros of this Champion since out still in the early game can go for the aggressive looks we'll see if they can make it worth their Kingdom on your parents with the Frog pick up that does give you possibilities on the bottom side I'm really excited to see Jack Halifax on a stable champion this determined that I don't think so far ahead yet a lot of forests and I believe he played a bit16 minutes from the I walked in right away to make sure they have their top cleaner for an early aggressive disc me to Jesse Tate or expecting the akali to go into the Top Lane or whatever the flash will decide to play in the kennel because they had the ability to save that right now they just saving a jungle picture that final thing but they did or didn't know that a person of these most play top when is akali and there aren't any across the year for rather he is a mage player through-and-through Vladimir lesandro down if he's kind of fixed so that walked in there and now they need just a final bottling march to pick or Peter bodley made them relief and I think that Comfort is really important to focus on that Oriana you talk about him just picking upwhat is the champion that rather created the big play vs Z2 to give them opening in that game flashing in on first try to punish birds for is over aggression opened up a possibility or Flash wolves will be able to take that game and that would be as a lock in there also going to have that flexibility on the bus. And I can't get this evening is Cain plays the rosicrucian apportioning no Shadow as fast as he comes out from him a bit more alluring and if you look at the enemy team they are all quite squishy they wanted to make sure that it was make the most sense to women in the game pain can be punished especially the Champion Lakes in jail now it's specially it will get at determining answer if you're playing with your food what are the indicators could be a catalystbaby I should decide to go floof are there plenty of rain Champion that you get inside your point of gallium comes on top and you like alright I'm ready to come out as soon as it's done and then you go for the fight the reason for having up by the way if you have a look at the patch notes recently the shadow assassin cooldown was taken out to eight seconds went to transform a strong so if your toe Invictus gaming looking by far the best team in the world the best need to make it into the top four on the outside looking in Invictus gaming are 44 this oneand we are on to summoner's Rift Invictus gaming looking at a 5-0 start Robbins there has not been undefeated group-stage team IG on the road for that onebut is there more CC Auto attacks started to flash a way it is going to complete unless your enemy flashes into fog of War so that it's all about the timing there and they got both the kill and the Flash out of the Thai thing here to be said Friday is that it was two classes for one but that is very little to say for yourselves after first blood but given over to be afraid of a level 2 came early on I think I want the akali get fat trout it's going to be very difficult to gang so I think the fact that we can start with a long sword early on definitely a great through the game Advantage if I can set flash. For Success my favorite part of that is that the shiz rushes over their head long he's right into the bush that he doesn't even have that option to try and get out or Flash wolves on the board here versus the defending world championI'm a little bit sad to say but the first indicator for me that name will be his ways and will happen if you're going poop one then you want a birthday images funny like electrocute the reason why it's so much better for pro play obviously the CC and taking it with you mighty zip code for the Tesla car to make that aggressive move with no vision on the end of my love it though because it encapsulate the idea that this team is always looking for the kill they said they're not afraid to go for the also not afraid to die for themare you guys ever look at the bright side of the shiz plays I like we believe in doing things well very gray be happy to go to advance and visit and while they are very small it's nice to see Robert having his pressure up against rookie I feel like you're probably the only person bringing out the Ariana in this one degree. You know he's already performed really well on it only thing is really going to have to worry about is the Yule passerby gang from Pain rise and set up games very well you have to worry about the room prisonso they're going to want some Vision around him to help him out back topside has been the name of the game who you found the money up there early on Flipping to return and see if the guy goes aggressive once again I don't have his Play the song using is he a fair bit for harassment and getting something cool down back down again a lot of this stew is just waiting for I think they know that they don't want to let this guy get behind like that and there's a possibility that nothing would make an appearance and you can definitely turn that to be too heavily in your favor even when no flashes and you can read as well as Delaney's family pushing back now it's crashing of the turd it should be going backwards Apostles side until there's the ward there's nothing waiting around at the shop I get to on TuneIn the question is how is it going to go to eat Fortunes in a to find the sun now and again it is no flash on either on every with anyone but nothing but looks like it's actually possible for Subway on this one and it could damage has the red striped pajamasnow it's a force against winning the Top Lane fight that again you can see the moment where they decide we could win this do we do that. I just use the Shroud ecologist use let's go for it but they're going price in South I wasn't on the bandwagon to check select so this point initialize the exchange with his foot so we can meet at Lee come down if I had a very very squishy you can look at the crap at least that's how I get and shut him down. As long sword at work that was busy getting the recall off during the first blood in the lungs before we are in his first gamedo on the 4th at rookies getting down to the Five On The Rise how far is getting pretty low shall see you can barely see that's the one throwing a bottom Lane now they're going to push them anyway might as well flag poles sticking around I think with the help are here on you should be able to stick around for a Betty they don't have to worry about another possible dive and it's just a successful romare from Rookie to answer one of the kids foot again making early move this is one of the players for flagpoles at two are looking for a proven he's out to see if he is a good dayfollow kill able to get that kill ping level six and use the ultimate for the victory in that by the shop keeps taking those swings we're not done islands near Mid I want points you guys stop looking at the bright side outdoor Splash was again finding the 140 looking at the bright side it's making it funny and loving that day off Waze app salute standing right now winning every single one of these skirmishes they are on fire now you can understand why the show I went to that place was level 6 level advantage over Hannah Baker and his crew the Shroud just didn't quite have enough damage turns on the mail a minion music you able to get it most every week then in midlane here Pookie goes in on the rookie if it is not the first image under Tower flashes out just in time and even know nothing about was the last they have a Teleport for good measure defending their teammates and I love to use of the exhaust I think it came out from ratha with the unsealed Spellbook mitigated the potential finding to dive onto and then make it a one-for-one but now I don't want to answer back they want to help out that talk later they have two members roaming up topside 1700 gold-bears it's about what you pay for with those four kills coming in the way they are that is that kind of straight here we go again does have no shroud have to play this out there ZR2 eat backwards. The way is 0 damaged else and clean you got a couple of Kain Soul right there that's about it I think we left now picked up and Rogers going to feel good about this one if he's got the small CS Lee. It's like it's too obvious it wasn't funny but at least it was said my motto I think it's it wasn't funny to least I said it every day. So you can see the pain is coming out they want to set up a dive and thing is that you making his weight away from the topside jungle to this the perfect opportunity. Side-by-side out play
so far he has already been able to find early games except with what is the least during the regular season of that final DSM if you pick something a little bit more aggressive than a couple of playmaking already off the bat taking away the stone at Erica SK Telecom don't want you to play it and they probably don't want to place themselves all right he certainly have their work cut out for them. They're big player right now you look back at their game against did get pretty big on the Kaiser was a potential carry threat there but couldn't put that old line is rest up Squad got kind of just down at the clit has been the big one and as you wait to see no jungle banned from the Roxy he might just take over head again look at the difference in Champion Select for this matchup between these two teams as compared to all these other ones at MSI so many of those flexible Pixarbecause there are more important Target fans here for the taking out this Joey in addition Target Denton in the Midway rek'sai there was the champion that clit had that your 700 game on where he really dominate it's a little bit of adjustments already in the most played champion of the year for impact was 10 and take enough table here as well as games like as I can see conspicuously very big so far by faith. Might get trapped in the next round of the draft for rice for sick year so is Rise being left open both akali and Javed are up for the other side of politics it away that are free to make their way to the drafted I feel like a job in is one of the best jobs in the world by impact rice get picked up but she going to let it to ya and he has the option of the lease in to fall back on if the darvin's even take away here so if they get the two powerful flexible fix that are left up here to get the risewhere the highest prize one of those Plex pics but the Silas and a collie both going over to Faker and con here will be difficult to deal with and there's no gangs like being hybrid impact has not played a rise game all year long despite all the other games are games like grabbed the right off the top we now know just playing that once was not flexible SKT can make sure they prefer which one of those do not have the file is Macaulay but Theft V Rowling's locked in at the very beginning I do think so the rise of the pretty decent collie and the Silas so I think that fine leaving it in the mid lane and I just hoping that impacted to come to take and something they can just play relatively safe a gangsta to fight auction from the side of SKT so mean to have a couple of the game they haven't engagedbest all right now exactly Douglas highest elevation on the team by a lot. Above 73% he has been the big playmaker damage chair at the very top and that's what is well this is a double Focus team even with Jensen even with impact is very strong players about the bottom in here for TLS Katie they get the signature pick for clit it's still more than double any other champion in his pool Gleason surprise here with the last walking from SK Telecom matching all Lanes picture by team liquid this only leaves the bottom Lane open and SK Telecom will be able to stay there counter Pick 4 last as well this means that they all looking at potential stupor canopy if SKT wants to go for a blind pimple on his wealth alternative they could just go for the bars as well which means that if you paired up with an aggressive support like the Nautilus all the galio then you can look the play for and aggressively insulting of the you can just take the timeand then you have a very safe I do expect the Tom kench band coming through here because if you have a games like if you have a ride if you have these things that you're looking at find a used Ultimate Sports the bottom side of the map of the biggest in the house is the time can still see if they do that Morgana was the first one here for Team Liquid and work on off the table as well and I'm wondering if it's going to be a very aggressive support out of TL what's livid not Elizabeth Requiem played at this year but even a house or something else that goes then look for have you push there's a horse the Nautilus band and looks like TI one more band to go for Teddy can lock in this one chance for us Katie Cali o or are they do kind of highest priority support still left on the table for both of them I guess I think the time can't is probably the better ban here for the team liquid side but we shall see if they have an answer right and then you question what you didn't pick him up Dahlia with multiple Donna and the norliss left so it looks likethe first thing as real band Madonna Bandit still getting rid of the safest option the bottom line is is still been telegraphed the whole way through started saying they want to give pressure with a double if so he gets very a very aggressive early jungler Tom Kent can let him play Super aggro double come with one of each with Elaine and be immune to ganked with corded on Tom catch the Team Liquid leak Alyssa galio once they hit a lot of engage often played at the jungle in the early game also has a lot of options. I feel like a pro team have their eye set on a neighboring that duo the question is which 140 elcon can do the same thing with thispraetorian plays at the end of the first round robin Team Liquid from North America SK Telecom T1 from South Korea so rarely does nav Korea but it's actually a chance in this best of one Team Liquid put together a super team they got Jensen over they got core JJ of recent world champion and it felt like this was the chance for any to make a big stride it's at Katie's return-to-form clit has been phenomenal the rest of the squad is ready to go and Daya number three of the MSI group state is ready to begin and I vs. Korea Team Liquid vs. SKT T1a return to form for SK Telecom T1 on the red side and a hopeful strolling of greatness here for a team liquid Faker back on a world stage your MSI 2918 with his new looks exactly Team Liquid the team North America built for international success leave trying to make upgrades even after back-to-back North American LCS title victories was all made for this moment adding Jensen adding core JJ definitely strengthen the team overall but they need to provide results on the international stagespeaking of Jensen is that she chose to drown the comet in this matchup against akali brawls in the face with a little bit surprising considering how mobile the akali is devastating for a little bit more of a dining room Trace try to poke that a colleague out and have a little bit more pressure in the other game I thought it was a trick that were down there be able to stab self they came down after the Red Bluff instead they actually know that she was going for this little brush play right here and not really game very important to have early information on enemy jungler passing as you can see there is a ward here by SK Telecom on the blue buff of Team Liquid so they know for sure that extended starting on the bottom side with no leaf on the Darvin and it kind of takes away the potency of the level to Red Bluff Jarvan gang 650 is it going to warm up the crowd afterwards go down to his will try and track early game we've had this magnifying glass to players is there okay where the way going to meet Corte De going to try to not give his information not a to get knocked out to answer an ask Katie get one for themselves ends up being Jungle full support jokes while as you say Cody in this group what's inside a Team Liquid I feel like I say to you the one walking away is the happiest team that killed himself the Scuttle crab and now it's happened. Once again maybe looking for a cheap place if you hope to have some sustained chord level 114 liquid speaking about it Lids he makes the past down you recognize is no 7 is available for ss3 teleport back into the lane has changed SK Telecom for the better the more aggressive look after the play 3-peat games on bottom side special to under the tree and then they chase window Vision on to Teddy into the river long enough for kids to get their lease and answers back getting the flash off of ss met you did not have it here that's why the repeat Gates does workout for 20 guests in there with the red box and SK Telecom get some plates off of the bottom turret in addition to the extra kill and I love the decision-making from Petty as well in the moment rather than focusing the jungle bunch baby carrier live a double life knowing that would the hail of blades being a Calista at level one he can force the forests out and with the arrival of Clint they would be likely able to turn into that favors a very good quick decision-making committee care about the expected bottom line Focus we expected a lot to be determined by the stranglers early on and definitely has set them up for Success on the side of SK Telecom Khan also invading to get some more jungle vision for the side of SKT to continue the traffic's missing to be on the bottom side of mid right here possibly in that brush put the drink at Ward himself motorcycle he's sending first three calls come in from the midline of stopping us back recently as well no Sheen done for impact good for sounds white together Jason costume extra ability power and control words that convey keep himself safe pushing the top sites and topside definitely will benefit a lot if that ocean Drake does go over first dragon will be an ocean I cannot just put even more importance on who's going to win the bottom side early fights because that's such a good Dragon Ford games like your little farm backup back off and regenerate you can help you on the outside but but that's Katy having the early advantage and them having the Calista Calio but they're in a very secure spot Malcolm X Play It's Baker and clit come through they got a couple of words unlock those down and dark out some of his vision is ocean Drake to get the Aldi aggressive towards down right here Flint does have kind of control of his bottom river right now he is around but going to be walking through words while doing so shooting star golf right now to quit notice that they do have priority in both of them it is that she ain't even stay stupid it's pretty big and you can see no impact getting jumped a bit low is that, but it's been a good job with kind of pushing around Canton now grab by Bill top winners and we'll see where to find somewhere else to go with papa globo's con was able to steal the Gangplank ultimate before impact himself his level six sometimes in Lane you can get it. Enemies old before they even get it if you push up the minion wave like that in the end in fact also sitting level 604 so action occurring I love that Clint is still hanging around the outside of the map on cool down so with those up and available to take him look for another potential play but also if you want to be a wet in the event of the vintage looking to try and find an opportunity back into the oldest out of the bank and I we talked about how good that could be working quite match up now to be on the side of head case all the time so gone with the stylus to be feeling very good akali can back off your back up in this crowd with addition to an early Vamps after they're just how much does a stain on the side of SK Telecom are feeling very good about those early moments we sauce on the bottom side of the map for SKT is 7 Minute ocean Drake means so much for winning a game that makes a Lenny face almost just fruitless 40 L to try to get to your ass down because the boss lean back and forth that was licking his wounds within 15 CS after a pretty catastrophic early start that deaf interpreter it was very rough and even now look at that out yet again and even more this Farm has different and plate number to does SKC in the bottom lamp to level difference but the fact that he's already level six so devastatingly bought land of the team liquid only level four for double disk on even approach the wave under his own power the deficit continues to mount tools the bought side of the map fortunately it is going well between liquid stop playing also going well we aren't even at 8 minutes into the game and it's already on a one-to-one basis Teddy up over a thousand gold over double if callista getting to the blade of the ruined King quickly here is going to be
I work at the trophy what they're both playing for here today and we're going to toss it out to the casters at the teams headed to Champion Select thank you very much it is time for a rookie vs. Faker Invictus gaming vs SK Telecom T1 skt's return-to-form started with winning the lck once again they gotten that one back but winning the lck is no longer the proof of the best team in the world feeding IG is the proof of your the best team in the world in the road starts here for sap Baker in particular had to watch on the sidelines everytime Altos Taqueria he's just going to be a stream. But today in Ms I get the Battle rookie about to happen so and none of themfrom IG so respectful after cleanse rek'sai game today absolutely dominating they're going to last band the wreck site and as much as everyone has always want to see Faker vs rookie Ming and Cliff have fought in the LPL to my favorite lpo jugglers because of how explosive ready chance leg looks by see his face he was interviewed and talked about how other team could play the off meta stop the different stuff like the Sona tiles example used already claimed every time the sun comes up with trying to take over this Lane do you have a 9 in a rowI just want to go for roaming don't let the sauna get her products on you or do you go for the kills and Draven I think you know which school of thought that champion flysas play Love episode of Tarak versus you would have to imagine Draven and notes does get out of the house before they need to let Faker and Duke include Starcon Popoff Indies team fights be really going to get the shield going to get the invulnerable Atif she can do a lot of glitter on his team fights but as you mention it's about latest the spiciness Nautilus and Ravens going to look for those killed on Sonos in a row we had those non-interactive but it says it's going to be a Farm Fest this is the sort of fault line if they're going to throw a tension on both sides Raven just shout look at me and you better be here if you're the jungle are because there's so much possibility of snowballing office bottom side if Draven Nautilus does not get really good does not cash in on the Draven passive beaten never double Sonet Eric Team 5 comes to fruition in the mid game how I can Sonic go is very much p.m. fight and specifically Baron control division comes as Katie probably looking to the jump to wait to see if you want to keep you well supported to run around this device with all the shield and vulnerability this town for work well in the five-on-five we will wait to see there's Wrangler as IG will grab ning's Champion first but also now knowing where it though so winners are we get to look at the shop on something maybe instead of Kennett alright Kennon with the on hits definitely has a huge potential to take over on the top side we seen the emergence of the gun blade build as well so you can still have the big AP affect later on in the game but again we're saving the jungler pics until last pic is why I was so hyped for this matchup hear the choices that go into how you're going to play this game now that there is a sonidera crow Raven from the Jungle 2 Jungle cast farming but she still has feelings too insane to drop that we're getting in this game we're going to have fun on his Camille will he use his kid a big difference storing or full clip once again dominate predictable if it is yes we do predict but side the level two commands can be finding a lane that she likes to look up and we are going to see on screen and expect any more movement's hear from these size going to be such an exciting battle Invictus gaming the best team in the world they did follow the G2 but you can turn into beds right now with the wind right here rookie always said I have to take down the proof that I am the best at rimac not the same without being here in your way I text him in front of them here the World Tournament of champion and now we're going to have the class that everyone was waiting for group stages a single bed versus ID doing the best teams in the world ending world champions Invictus Gaming & S Kati the historical best team of all time pilot still by Baker in the midline D best player of all time and no one would ever dispute you on that and level one already spicy with a hook not yet going away and I might be engaged already has done and if I have continue with some damage these players are on the edges of their seat ID price of this game is not disappointing guess what drain even got the kill for Invictus gaming Meanwhile Back lid on the leasing get SK telecom's early gold honestly think that both these are kind of happy with where that money went and the reason why I picked this up and get to that do a focus on the start the blind hope it misses and then that's double Dazzle Harold's in the meanwhile it's a stove griddle at level used as well so Teddy will not have either Summoner nor will Nautilus on the bottom side then Baker and I lost switching spots there so the reason why I G keeps on the invade if they want to take over the but I might this political jungling West tournament I don't have that jungle outside with someone that means that raven could do things like this no items purchased for either Lisa North Raven but I'll let playing aggressively in the bottom side does go in for that hook they're really trying to take advantage of this matchup he's got the skin he's using now name the level to Red Bluff in 2K targeting Faker greatest player of all time down yellow to breathe but not much more than that of authority a fight in the jungle clip as well they put it in the hands of men can't look at the 200 hp enforcement early Recon release in now stuck inside No Man's Land driving to be easy even 5 yet another word for fights and how far solo and then out goes IG yeah Jackie Levin bowel I think our little bit too low to fish off of continue dive there but be objective is completed they take him down and I are still fighting constantly 1100 gold with IGN and this is why it's so early quid does stick around yeah he's going to try and come down just get the extra Kildare jackeylove flashes for the second kill their on Draven catches in a tiny bit more I don't think he's been catching that many axes in the meantime but the bigger reward double bus down there in the bottom side against no flash Dona no flash terrorists may have gone that says never finish donut art game played with professional Korean team in it that was no games in the promotion in the final and the word wasn't even in scrims Korean teams were playing stone at our exit the first look we see is SKT Lafayette in a handicap in the early game 4 minutes make purple planning phase right now and keep mine like this was gonna stare at you track the 80 Karen the one side jackeylove for support on the other have a good one population 3 as it'll kill comes through a 30s vs irelia is dead I mean you would want to you understand why this donut Eric would want to leave that lane without a lot also says you know what I can do as well he didn't even have that much impact hear its name again on his signature Camille goes in camping bed get this done onto Faker jackula was pushed up the bottom line in the NHL I'm sure it's got more killed at this than minutes in the game and now numbers fixed and they giving him a jack you up on a killing spree 5 minutes then they are slaughtering to the Jungle matchup between many ways they try to get there. If you log into your free time on the bus side couple of shops Lane hasn't even upgraded a lot of junglers stop using Cameo after the nurse like you admittedly said we're mostly targeted at farming ning is. Farming jungle monsters then is farming Champions constantly getting these engages Landing the son for his teammates and now I G set up for tremendous success only 5 and 1/2 minutes into the game more kills than men it's always a great time for delfi LT Mane IG firing all cylinders the shy maybe not going to be a major factor in this one 5 and 4 vs 4 and 3 to go by for round number for down here and teddy as Martha's phone number 11 he was on 10 2 minutes ago and it's it's just that figured being there doesn't even allow the many safety the towers still going to go down I see you're not only going to get those mid plate but also in the mid lane rookie has made with push up those minions and Clinton was the only one with left to defend he can't stop the rise pressure either this is absolute domination from the defending world champion PS4 controllers on the outside of why you have to take the longest way around it's a tree Rose Lane in the butler I know that you're laying with her Tumblr or fake a rotating through but it doesn't change anything but plain when is inevitable and the timer on Penny and mother having their items together it's so far away the champion picking up CS this is why games where the top winners are both like? What's going on the map on the bottom called Teddy and not today the best bot Lane in the world and right now they are being handily dismantled by jackula balance and of course these rooms from ning now yes the first blood came through very early on or at least the Adoration first killed during level one but didn't shop with that it was several kills them in the house be upside down more partying and then flashing for regardless 2% KP for employment training slicing maelstroms but the shy getting the better of that's right now I got to take a visit as well comes over and words but kind will be able to slip out and once again and then flashing for it this time around forces the engage onto Faker and they get the kill once again it's over a 5000 kg is threatening just roll over the top of them 1900 gold and either bought women are less than anyone else in this game SKT clip actually make things will come out not going to find the word happen to the queue so he's going to stay alive on this one as an ocean Drake makes it even easier for an IG that's already had no power and found out
thank you very much Dash and ryzen 1400 chance to see is Silas in this will be dropped off the face of the rift for the fifth game today flash wolves 1 and 2 there School win against wrongful Buffalo do you do Esports looking like a top-tier team in this room it over to take care of business against black lives here and it looks like they're going with the rides with Echo Polly and Silas Bowl still available fix will be locked in for I quickly I want to make note that this was Raisa left open in a game with di2 I buy in the creative and also it being Absolute Comfort for Wonder and caps I think you have to take it first picked even though it hasn't been rated first pick in many dropsI went to see now with him to come out along to this one typically teams will wait a very long time to show their second solo Lanes at wonder and Taps both have equal opportunity to play a quick pick up here now for a more aggressive play foursome engage we're going to probably look at follow-up team fight then out of this one yeah and if you're facing the team fight they already have the Tom kench on the side of D2 so there a lot of options with the abyss The Voyage moving around the map for later and see if black Willows answer it with a little bit of semi Global themselves and more followed so this is the bog standard let's dive in a backline locked in the cage follow up with the NACA end of the tan and try to kill some back liners 80 karrie bands you would imagine going towards something a bit different in the bot Lane that was the Nika on the date of time is going to be so much moreyou want me to stop and I'll previous series and we'll see how many but link has been taken out and put on display in the last game The Tom kench and Azrael required zero jungle attention of the entire game extremely safe and that allows you to put so much into the solo Lane that have been so strong for G2 in setting up multiple rooms in setting up their control of the map for the mid game might be taking up some of that help and getting a soul in his head taken off the table he roll-off dropped off we know if there's still one more time for me to grab for fossils one more for G2 as well and fossil can finally answer a little bit when that finally comes through is a couple of marching bands of course caixa in Calista off the table and not waiting what the final Flat Shoals band will be what will pick up a dropped off the echo stick that comment you made about the Edge of Time can smell meaning resourcesmaybe the contest would respond rather than just going for a topside jungler like for example the Leafs in the latest Indo will be the event there is always concerned with you end up with three laners jungler and Cousteau Lane is it to 14522 composition hear Rihanna ball on top of the jar been jumping with the galio on his back now that is a huge Wombo Combo I believe it looks like a team fight comp sings be what you wanted to hear an aggressive bottom Lane is going to be what they want something that in the right person maybe you can force a kill Sarah would have been fueling on the farming side now the answer isa lot of options Food Lion to Silas in either mid or Top Gear only have full information where the matchups that I can definitely bring him back through the Ariana trade damage in the mid they make oh oh so flexible on the G2 side will be the final luck exactly what they think is better but Nico and Silas is here as real I think 99.9 percentage of first place are the salon and I will see who they want to fight against better rise top orianna mid and looks like it's Nico about of the rise and Silas about it Ariana Grande where do you want to try to take down the right I think you have to go aggressive on Rise to make this matchup works we expecting on hit build coming in from all you can be to try to push but on head is the one that really kind of sticks The Landing over the course of the early to mid game transition to variance to see once we hit the game the room Choice coming through from Hannah and that Dooby Doo on the top sidedefinitely a go the way of the Jarvan and Rise room prison into Jarvan knock up could turn that entire game plan right back around on them so tracking the enemy jungler is going to be of the utmost importance in this game a long as you land the room prison even if she does turn invisible tonight. Still almost certainly will like we just saw in the previous game flaps on the back foot you get they have never ever missed the top for MSI across all the years they have gone this would be the first they missed looking to pick up a win against GGG 2 who has been impressive so far has been a great pride of Europe here at this tournament and Nikki X seems to be able to keep playing with the roster letssingit in the gamewe are on to the rift here for game number 5 flash Wolves at 1 and 2 G2 at two in one Invictus gaming round-robin lots of game still here to play North be disappointed with the first three or four games results there is lots of still do and prove and improve upon G2 certainly looking Fierce come so far in this tournament and caps on Silas was just on display earlier today versus Team Liquid with a little bit of attention from Yang Coast he was able to demolish the team later on and be to have a comp that would really fit them even if it was the same teacher lineup at Worlds 2018 this is the quintessential131, coming from 3 to Wireless at Actos side length as the game goes on at the moment you see galio jarvinen Ariana like freak so silly put it's a team fight come through and through on the side of flash feel like you're saying though G2 drafting so many answers for that type of constant composition perks on Ezreal with Mickey Exxon Tom kenshiro the abyss avoid being able to lend and more threats to a 1-3-1 style of play and then yank goes having the kickback year on lease in is a huge disengage little thing that happened right there is rather walk down to the war that was a veal to leech experience for that Ward kill this tells me normally down the toll Lane get the kill the entire first wave plus something else to get level 2 instead if you share an award XP it's just the first wave we knew cats. XP himself on a single Ward though it's going to be level two bit early but shouldn't mean too much because look at the same XP caps went down for a late Lord also to try tothank God for this jungle pathing sell a different agencies going on there is that level two already as you mentioned break in the bus lane right now perks and Mickey happy to give up the push to fly just getting some Farm another to write his first acts up his manaflow band and the wait to see what else comes in here I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by Jeff Howell Nikki extant words are playing at gotten two or three Duo kills in Lane just across the street they've been actually dominant as a do I would say overall and we knew they were good but you actually stuff up so well have been impressed I will say we're going to track these jugglers early on and boujee on the job and has gone to Red Bluff straight to topside if you get that room prison in prison and knocked up and this clone go out for one or an hourly rate for bougie was the big moment that I put down by cops at level on didn't spot him but now yank us is lying and white as more man I can do some damage here but going to try to flagcan help him heal back up when he backs away this is so big for G2 they took a very very terrible opening to the game getting destroyed here as we talked about in shape as long as you have the point-and-click room prison and makes Jarvis job so easy you guarantee that combo they get the early kill them anyway still pushing in his favour but gancos doesn't let it at that lies in wait at the fellowcraft he sets up and kill 4 cap and once again this is capsulas with early money I want I want the fewest to appreciate is not just the early money being sent it on to the oh so scary Silent from caps think about what was gained in those Gangsta kill topside first but go but no flash is used by Wonder but then the red front coming intiming coming in for the silence as well the phone is subjective go the way of seats so we can definitely talk up what class was got out of it in it that early fear for ride a Nabi is the guy that they want really money on to write to backup your points and obvious been one that is not more resources in Mora flash wolves Focus since the changes to the team so he's the one that they should be focusing on and ride can be an answer in that side lane even if they have to do with the butt Shack San Diego's fine since second successful gienchi every time we come up with a story here for Flash wolves janko's answers it again the leasing is on fire extremely active in the early game and helping out those solos as expectedking of the jungle artist Lee that's the more ideal situation him setting up the kills for his solo laners and then catching in we get ice will freeze frame there of recent down Jarvis the moment right before the gym flag of the wall into the Q follow and we all saw that one play out to look at this G2 800 gold ahead and I think of unfortunate that the kills were given 2019 MSI colorized Sox earlier in the broadcast right now Sky Highonce again 500 gold leave for G2 Esports can you sing the wits and being rushed very early Wonder had the components right now already is it even harder be knocked down by this rise as you got the durability to handle most this one's going to get that one just yet but overall the favorites not looking very good in this tournament it should be noted that one that has much more flexibility than the rice and needs to build his peers and work into the seraphs Embrace and from there because of that one that can attack both so Alliance by building a with then the second up that magic resist and they will be enough to force rise under attack early recalls to try to kontest with an echo in the sidelines of enough to silent but we should note has gone conqueror 4 extended brawls then he may be able to answer the rise usually impervious in the side light here we go there going to focus on the top side caps is level 6 on the sides but Yanko sits on award supplies wolves know that this is comingGianna be coming right back in if you see is the least then drop off the word that you have pretty trademark G2 Play Right Thurr caps getting the push broom outside trying to find one of his wings to put a head so quickly it has been Wonder exactly whenever SKT with all the pressure they gave wonders Jason similar brains out of hackers are putting pressure on right now in his Lane going very well at 5236 PSI is the me one of the funnier jokes that Tyler is it still a maybe you get the Oriana ultimate you can go to a sombrero but you don't get to move it around much so it's it's mostly for those all in trying to get the extra full back there and I want people to know it was really nothing purchased on the back it was a false back on the Ariana wants to wait till 6 minutes teleport back in and then laying a gentle spps backup nothing doing their winter up awkwardly on that back I'll talk a bit late at all if you wanted to burn anybody or to cool down to Cape the trade came back and is it an escape to try to Auto Tech couldn't quite get it there and he's not in time to get through the re calling youthen whatever no harm no foul but it's 1500 Goldwing G2 ahead if they gotten Farm in a lot of places right now and now round 2 in the bottom line is Betty take a couple of shots for Cerritos still doing pretty well in this Lane up again solution up in form mean while keeping track of these jugglers yank us is actually not making his way down to the bottom side and he is level 6 with access to the dragon kick and he continues going for these invade on the flash wolves Red Bluff started up by himself and Brooke is going to trade I'll sing into the trade like you mentioned a Level under no completed send a whole both teams had Vision around the area at the sea fishing but not of course spotting the word that song Come interestyou got knocked the Warhammer right now going to go for the quick Mountain Drake 8 minutes and change in this will be helpful in the mid-to-late game and going to plow down some cigarettes as well on tests and eventually. We'll go over cleanly rather grass is blue so far everything was fine I do really enjoy watching you know successful uses of Champions likely sin in the early games you guys get a lot of the power of the champion in actual just straight-up one-v-one Julie was taken out and so much of it is about the information in the mobility that you have two choices that you make with it that you know these advantages that you've gone for the team have been with smart choices no setting up the brush pink there by the Scuttle crab you don't forget the first one the first kill for
I fell because this is going to come down to it now so much pressure on the side of Tes side has been highly prized topside counter fix the name of the game freak let's see where we going to get into this time around see if we do have the orange showing up in the band again if we are going to have to carry carry match up because Ben's already shown that he's very willing to play play the tank for Forest if they if they are going to leave it up and if you're in a situation where 369 is basically guaranteed be able to get counterpick unread Lucian Spenser band keeps coming through Camille band keeps coming through and not one Cars wants to play here and we'll see what else comes out of the band Faith it's really not been the name of the game here it's it's been hot focused every single time and its outer pick has mattered getting the early blank tank hasn't been enough we saw the old LPL stand by I went looked at what are the top winners that are played in the lp on Bluetoothpause between reps was not good enough over in game 3 so you got to find something else last time someone was on Blue it was Orrin that wasn't enough either I want to see what can happen though champion of all time in the semifinals in the lp LP 690 Quinn into it and they also got to have that in the back of their minds when they considering Visa blind pick fee is beer actually taken out away from Angel cell signaling maybe more of the Oriana priority that the night has had for most of the day.I'll see what I can get out of this one are we going to see you since the first games anymore at least it had been so highly prized and you got to Talking Stick what you wanted as real as I saw the first time around but you got still a lot left open the Orion has been contested back and forth as well stop playing the most played five grapes and Selena the series that we're finally back on to it now through but Jack is Elmo's phone is almost as well as the gym priority before last game what kind of dropped off at and they've got the option here to pick it up for Jackie love let the Leona asriel's that's such a great combination with the offensive capabilities and wants on his door guard plate aggressively going for the burning flash go down by themselves earning kills for themselves in the bottom side of the mapit really did just pick them out completely different story for tonight I want to see if I get more of a dive comp together what's going to come through you can't really pick a top limit in Connecticut in test it with bands are going to go for a car and Angel for world has not played in the elf and actually threw it away the kind of Sauron kind of expecting here but not in the way that we thought it was going to is actually 369 and yes that Blind Pig for the topside they got both their solo laners locked in so early here also kind of ducks protected in before because when I opened up an entity very easy target for Gangplank that could be another one of the things they may be trying to protect here trying to get more safety for the bottom side of the map put more into Jackie love for these play I've been a super strong Jen and they started out the series that way you'll understand that top before it's actually blinded both solo Lanes in this game or janica answered by a collie bands to cover or that helps of course quite a bit but it means alot to fix are going to be going to throw a bit more and then we'll see if Fortune been on the side of a of jackeylove he's he's really being kind of beer on the 80 karrie roll Lulu as you want to keep playing at World Lulu was a new pick up for the world and it would go really nicely with our five-on-five set up that they have right now you have Oriana orange scaling for those team fights later with Graves Ash and if you supplement that with Lulu Port that is a tremendous five-on-five set up meanwhile soon it's going to be a collie early they do have the Assassin blocked in they're going to have to play a much more spread out style looking for those killed in the Jax beer once again at forbidden into the orange tank on the top side now Wednesday is very good against the weather if they are both been going to kill the backline make it pretty easy but there is still a lot diving in over the top as it is still a very heavy. Felix so important at the beginning of the day that's a really prioritize counter engaged in a lot of their situation for picking up that X Games to add that Biff disengage from oleona that will collapse on you you do have especially when some kids get to level 11 need to get the Rings to win the ultimate and you get that extra range with it it does give you some sort of mean for traversing the map and trying to deal with some of the split Style game that you're going to face when you're facing a team that's running in a colleague act as their double solo aunt all right final thoughts out of the coaches Do Or Dye for top Esports ever managed to win game 2 but they've still got to win back-to-back games to stay alive at world deep breath near freaked out it's just best of ones you have to visualize from this point on for talk to use for one game at a time there are the LPL Champions they want to be the world champion in a lot is riding on their shoulders mean while spooning knows they're about to have the eyes of a Nation on them they are the knockdown top Esports and be the last LPL representative left and it'll be on suiting then the team to have the LPL 3p the LPL era of taking the trophy and we are back to the Korean teams on top was either going to happen here. These words can they win two straight for does tuning close it out in game four or game 5 the order comes through they put a lot of faith on Jackie loves to be a big Carry On The Ash Tom Kankakee the back line state through been either carry top winner he gets counter pick against the orange crabs the Jax has a Jarvan the may be upset that match of even further we are out of the wreck it is such a fortuitous start for been because of the early attempted gang by Garza and the jungle invade follow-up is FM saying about for that died all these early kills the early money the wave control setup to view will bounce back that minion wave all really set up Jack to become the monster that he was this time around you can't be expecting that same repeat of the start but for suiting they've got their eyes on the prize and if you are the team from the LPL you take out the number one and number two seed there is so much riding on your shoulders with great power comes great responsibility and they will don't have to deliver Ward sweep does come through to take out the early vision and they're actually pulling with the Leona Azrael laying a lot of times with the Israel not to pull so that you can actually get some Dominion wave so you don't get pushed in early on yep not going to the case of Summer on do they will happily go to Lane late meanwhile Carson solos his Red Bluff take the chickens pretty well as well always important from a long-range units there as you fight that Raptor Camp Topolino's back and forth But Bundt gets grasp and level 2 first will come to Ben and that will be his something to play around I think there's a very easy interaction for the Jax counter strike when he went 369 cast Bellows breath you wait till it's done you start Counter-Strike and you will Dodge every possible attempt to break the brutal Sun have to go plus a little something for the Bellas wrap it actually only applies brittle on the end of the poop when he spits out the last little bit so Champions that have Mobility like Jack sent you can actually Dodge out as long as you need to get hit with the beginning of the Bells breath if you dodge the last bit you don't get the griddle hard they are found going to be here he does not have much more to for one so far and they want more send them back home 321 who has gone well it looks like another fortuitous start break of everything 1002 gold lead for suiting 3 and 1/2 minutes into the game of bottom Lane gang from sofm on the jarvin what a clear from him get sitting there is able to force out the flash from you make sure that you far away from Jackie Levin jackulate didn't Flash the EQ from Darvin here so autotempest changes targets he goes right on Jackie love note from him and usually heal what's that is sore. Follows up stand up and he is dead now they've got a number to Advantage if they decide decide to match your teleport and this is going to mean again so much for the game plan going from their tries to fly from front of car so I'm just trying to block the auto attacks from graves if you can't get behind them but what it really means is a random vacation for the bottom Lane once again the Ezreal Leona Lane gets the place so aggressively hear some of the Spells were burned yes jackeylove saved his flashing went down but it's the two kills to be as real for your super early tea or so he's going to be stacking up very quickly should go for the more scaling off because if I'm if I'm Jackal if you're okay you're not just going to get electric eels more damage we'll just act you're going to really run off for a minute that's fine but you have kind of squandered the goldie by not letting you win the two onto any harder well he's got a double-book for himself to settle for a bit that's the flavor give power for the meantime and also mean since so many cool down for use on the bottom side of the map that didn't get left alone in that top side match up with the orange gets a consistently threatened 369 and 50 uses teleport Early Trades aggressively trying to force out the same from 369 rm2 to bring us closer possible because health and Mana back up with me which website down here for the whole nine on both temporary health and Mana leave for 369 Galaxy hops away from what would be the last part of the W blocks away I believe you got grass by off just in time but either way doesn't mean too much 60s lead car Sarika and get Alaina so is any kind of a tank and fall asleep then jumps away to not forget with the brittle all right now what does Jarvan again you're looking to make a a place off of other crowd control that you have stood up in your lane but you can also turn your eyes towards in a collie went to call is level six because night splash was used already on long cool down still left on it and if you get level 6 kill for a collie for Angel it actually can snowball incredibly quickly for the sidelines as well because an angel gets the threatened for those rooms for those game he would probably want to go purchase first you still has not gone to get his first break his back yet but that can definitely be another point of pressure so I saw the sun has a lot of options open to him meme through the whole series still active is the easiest way to solo it has pretty media pretend it's not terribly Panky so karsa has no problems doing this on praise course he did get one kills left of a longsword plus red Smite in pretty early on even has some honey fruit essentially full health in Man of the next part of this one so the game state is a v in a gold leaf versus a drake-lee not that too bad on a burn to teleport to get back into Lane this time does have the pickaxe in the now we can start playing field Lane. Jack looks for 3 to get spotted we'll see if it's okay it is going to be towards the blade of the ruined king version of the build-out stackers on this team not hitting a heavy with Frontline but it is 4 x male you're going to get a lot of value out of roofing hurricane alright goes for the invade here and has a D4 to do the confidence with the with a pushing akali mid laying here not too scared of a possibility to Port runs coming out pretty quickly and honestly I don't think I should be an overload on the on the invade he does know that this might was used as a fan has Smite but can't see phase Rush decent were control back and forth I like that really smart shop it throw it out of range no chance rest of us might kill some time
I am outside if you need more than that and it came up here on the red side they have been fairly competitive day one game against Invictus gaming close but never able to close it out as Katie it's their first game of the day maybe they're cold as much as he wanted to from day one and it's a chance to be to strike and need to get that first we will definitely want to see the pdb Invictus gaming stop being afraid to dive Gracie's play the letter that does start with sole Norflex biggest rise at a rally all right with the first two off the bat hear a collie still very much available tell me what's on the playlist titled What's the fastest bike ride in Baker had so many rides game team is very comfortable on it being taken out by both sidesthis episode of Game what might be left open I wouldn't be once on the family decide to go and yeah curious to see what looks what was that bottle and ends up looking like so far the trademark Ezreal still up for Teddy's play that three times more than any other championed is usually think about you but you can handle this or his his most favorable champions of the year of dealing with one fell off the table fan out the last of those main flexible text again returning to the jungler discussion that we've been having here includes Improvement in that last one really controlling thing for SK Telecom early that was kind of you know the entire name of the game for this generation of SKT that got rebuilt Texan taking one nap when it comes to a little bit more but I like them both on skp in the LPL support band every other bottle cleaner available any kind of a kind of match of your availability if they want to attack tattoo on to directly playing potentially expect in this scenario bottomland for SK Telecom this will allow me to spend his time in the top triangle of the map you kind of ping pong between Top Lane and mid-length really getting advantages for those do I have to say though for me for the farm who Buffalo their bottom land has been the standout area of the team for this tournament big coral and palate have both been quite it's so many of their game on the bottom rack on a dentist a status about lions happening so it seems like the action is set up and I do want to ask you how is at least game against ID 83501 upset time and again it is coming in here I think played pretty well overall big picture on the main stage here for pbms and he has another one of those eight 2nd round picks in town if you're going to have to make one on each side almost certainly but given to the night nature of the job that's a lot of black stuff inside not available excited to see what I come to see McAllen for example the most viable blind picked up later band away and whittling down on the top Lane Champions. And Sarah us know two guys that have played in the top 1 have been talked up so heavily from both of their region at different time but seemingly have had a bit of a stumble on your kind of getting more and more the Champions push down and down and down stairs like top 7 CHAMPVA are already up and out across the nine Stolen Dance across this point already so you are as you mentioned really down to the bottom of your pool calming Lane Prescott really like the combination of Elise & LeBlanc it's super phone if you can get any sort of early Advantage they can both said each other up with traffic to cancel a block in the leblancs text to roam around that can be terrifying sounds pretty good Comfort your foreknowledge third most played of the Year hectoring Freight into a truck is conspicuously one of the top one is left and it's probably back in line for 02 years so I do Similac what is Katie has pins and I might not see the farm of his ear maybe the form of Corky on a great lake game in both regards here four fingers and faces Mega + 10 to 15 CSD so far in the middle and he should be able to survive there a pretty common pick into the old block for scaling Lake a payment on the side of PBB they might be going late game side push and they do go for the Fiora and this particular match-up in the last two patches around the world in playoffs versus Khan and Khan definitely early but I'm at shop that's who she's going to be looking at is going to be like in happy Indie and I do like the match up most of Akron schools that could happen play a difficult but on land we know there's a great player top winner for numerous in Vietnam he's been very good I think as well as when a player overall in the music and I know for the 585 meanwhile Fiora is always best part in a side length doesn't help you killing today to carry I guess Hey Dad I really do like Fiora into a hacker 04 FIFA PVP only thing I really on watching out for possible jumper jungle gangster because they will have the advantage in that all I'm with the extra damage that comes through but once if you are starting to get some levels if he comes so good in that side lamp and the heck am I going to have to play with the team welcome to summoner's Rift our fourth game of the day skate Telecom T1 Beach Champions out of South Korea a Regents that you expect a year-over-year to bring the best teams in too big of Legends in 2018 was not that and now the part of 2019 a stumble in game one but the ability to bounce back they've got two more games today including that shut down within Victor's later on as Katie could immediately jump back up to the top banga Buffalo of course their last minute leg on home soil for the first win both teams are to have a lot of overlap and that's what I love about to go to bed at League of Legends when you can read what he wants to do is win condition that can be so topsy-turvy the game right here the actual early traits helped zeros a lot HP plus trade itself is better so we can pushing clip back taking you against another plus five help so very early games later on he can indeed 1 V 2 cases both of them out of the top side of the river, is going to recall and refill it supposed to track because we've already talked about how a Champion Select with a deer Lanes me Nashville Tom against Iraq on our expectation is the play around those lenses to prioritize and topside popping is what we do expect an a plane from LAX and recs I at least thought I'd just potentially throw a wrench in that depending on what she wants to do with the future cat easy least go to both these player that does put them in complete saga Board of Lee and he starts were actually spotted whatsoever is and they both is going to bottom side right away it's red the drugs in the one but red down the blue the other than my feet of the schedule for Chowan meanwhile on the top side here is Derrick Rose going for the Strays once again with con when the difficulty for the heck room here is that it's so hard to avoid giving those sweets by his 206 with the early levels doesn't have any way of avoiding it and he's pretty much the sum total of how much damage you can do toiling around like a helicopter that's where his threat ranges but that's the only time you enter that as a field is the title of the overtime you end up winning the war of attrition as a field electric company leaves near the jungle pathing will get her close to 3 but not quite Fair The Ward Houston looks like we're going to get that first division the bottom side takes bottoms cuddling up with a reason to annihilate struggles is because of scuttle crab if usually not after picking up drugs and dust about this doesn't have a thought struck clear can me and she gets into some awkward spot but this time we're going to go up to the top side right through the mid Visionaries do e-zine but on the topside serous go very close to Cara could be available and of course wreck site nearby as well as I did walk over toward they do know Rex I have stopped River but it means a horse recover from saliva Suite B2 is a seminar off otherwise it escaped out of PVC yeah you can see at least they're trying to hold the cocoon for the Tom Kent Tompkins using the flash Barry early then he changed his Target and they the Devourer out as well the critical Summit of burn is Mata that flash War Tom kench not available for repeat Focus snow devour to remove them so given that interaction body in the trunk and makes a lot of sense actually in quite a spot for PV beef after the game as well leave there were extra minion so they can try and Fries here against the Azrael Azrael long-range can try to throw these Mystic drive but getting very very good for Big Goron pallet down here and severely stacking up the SLP sex that much issue these farm so far pretty much equal has become so far into this be at least able to pick up the dress as well so jungler not for the topside they force their releases are the Couture went down but you see how much the way I the minion that take the advantage how far is my only claim comes away unscathed hey this is ours that PSA I was talking about earlier papasmithy to poisoning stuff you don't have to worry about early is the ignite true damage for the all-in from an Acura a Big C, there goes the small vital in addition to the potion Chucky there's enough to keep their Us Alive long enough it so they are going to secure the first place but at least already is Rafael and RT Flash Forward to finish that do clit can answer for the do for us so much for a glaze on the microtex of doubt we already know the Corinthians about managing their minion waves normally not in the PVP, but looks like it works pretty well for them here as well as a 1,000 gold Lee now for SKT watch was burned 3 minutes ago is most the way back up now and if there is no further punishment on that first tank was all for naught as we did against Eclipse if you can't find a half away in that jungle matchup pushing it toward death Katie here very easily itemized the ninja tabi again the very Early Trades a very comfortable for him and now we're done for the Shadows available ngacapruk 120 away with their live with the health part of these goes to the Korean fancy moves but also the Summoner spell Advantage very big for the Korean all these bottomland Summoners were blown in that exchange clits then able to retreat to the dragon in here we'll go such a long way in helping out this way and I think it will be given to Corky and asriel all going to be spamming that spells get Lane control around 7 Minutes around 10 minutes one on the way you're going to text me or iced tea look for Lane Swap and potential of for Rift Herald and topped are damaged and try to keep the fee or down when the truck is not there is a counter effective on Boxer and especially since in addition to its ocean Drake the early kill on top
on this stage has work so hard this moment to become champion let's start off with the strategy coaches for both sides have gotten into the band So Far Away Solo in Focus here has been what are the best players in the league kills outside of that Midland clearly focuses on the side of TSM Banning away the tarek of that so no Tarik bottom Lane as well as the chase that it was a question of what kind of storm impact with over and over again in here even pulling the Jays fan Broken Blade willing to get that off of his plate their star talk later or is it going to be more about Puritan in the 1B want that he will have with Jensen we've seen such great things out of broken play coming over from the TCL representing turkey so well in the LCS and that has been such a successful strategy already with their Tom Kent that alludes to a possible split push later in the game even harder for impact if you want to play carry versus carry you are blind pig very likely additional meanwhile on the side of Team Liquid great team Fighters have been locked in galio very good AOE also a lot of certainly mix things up in that side lamp I want to talk about because North America we have seen with such a strong showing throughout the playoffs in Jarvan has been struggling has not been waiting out in the Radeon spiffy to be able to perform in game 1 and Acadian specifically on the wrecked by this has been his best champion this split huge carry performances from him early on in the tank and very heavily getting those so Lance going may have wanted to go for here if you wanted pack on a carry this is something that is a bit of a signature pick for him that he's been able to survive on to withstand the onslaught of a game and it will be denied me to think more and more that Broken Blade last week that it will be about that carry purses carry top and it does look like we are going to have a little bit of split Focus are there really a band has come through trying to chip away at those carry champions for Broken Blade Top Lane is the name of the game I'll wait to see you as a middleman I gets banned away as well recently had six on your screen to time LPS LPS throughout his career Jensen Elaine dominant Midland player on the world stage tourist history on this day Champion cover tells a story the birthday earlier in this season and he will be so easy for a number one we know if your son is excellent at that champions do this for Jensen or impact barma teer very likely made that you are a spicy Pittsburgh A1 let's go number 1 opening a stronger this is nothing but excellent going to come through for Broken Blade to match up the tenants but we got spicy fix liquid side like you wanted as well as a hybrid Vigor ultimate grenade what's the wave consistently throughout the game that will try to attack early in the game early on post level 680 to land from piercing hurting or grenade exactly is what brings the combination to get that will charge up your big lasers that come through and allow you the possible want to be two scenarios and its BLTs bring put a title and a trip to the mid-season Invitational internationally as well and TSN had the same goal picking up Sven and making a few more changes so they got here in his first time in playoffs straight to file Regina on the wrif going to be dropping down these turrets trying to block the paddle stars avoid damage avoid set up from Zoe in the Midway you can hear both these teams are crowd favorites the ascent at the Lion's Share for the history of League of Legends in North America but TSM have returned to the finals to find Team Liquid in their spot back-to-back defending Champions here with the MVP on their team bottom line trybus War does go down will see a possible Jarvan at red side Scuttle pathway down here spent and smoothie do not want to start it off getting ganked ubernick Summoners if you are on the side up to you said you've got to be thinking through all the possibilities of why they're going for the Heimerdinger of what this means for the game this is not something you are used to whatsoever and the Scuttle oven doesn't make you have to worry a little bit until he shows on another Ward splitting of the jungles very highly possible here does not get the knock up on the crab so he's only going to get the armor shred from his cue Pierce will take a little bit longer to finish off that objective rewards down across a pond River really spot which I was up too early on with a game but a gangster if somebody can cut bottom lamp to be a spot of going through all that careful about where that level two Jarvan is because that level 2 game from Jarvan after Red Bluff is so so strong and we have to highlight once again I supposed to flush the Waverly on you can see Jensen there with these candid mean in addition to that Top Lane with the Canon pick into Vladimir even though overshadowed by the time for dinner or pick also supposed to be a pushing Lane for Team Liquid early and it should allow Xfinity the agency here on Jarvan to keep track of akkadian track that rek'sai early on in the game will it be the full on 80s with Bushmills hear from him is it going to be some of the hybrid Bill 226 thinking in like the gun played for the full on a p i want to buy Rush the protocol because that's what I'm expecting from Spotify the scryers Blue Moon ice cream in the Middle Lane here by Pearson Farm is equal across Beast flashing as well put an early jungle tracking is objective here from the bottom line is they pushed so exhausted as well as fat or JJ though it's early game jungler out of his jungle setting the wrecks I behind is certainly pretty worthwhile in breast side without the Flash's you are so much less effective for a Canadian what does battle back to pretty low HB the forestry call put peroxide back in has the blue Smite now full resources back around to farming attract any more later on and farm over all this game really close small leave it outside in the jungle lead also pay some dividends mean when all the extras to stay in here in inventory Forest Bend could do a lot of work for CSF he has the biscuit he has the extra help husband at his disposal you can see how far back is Broken Blade had to play this is one of those people talked about especially for the very end of the regular season could impact hold on and carry mystery match up it's all he played up against flyquest that went well against Viper now broken so far so good for the candidate will have to see if time goes on at who takes hold up gladimir go to scale extremely well early on local that are long cool down Sonic you definitely hurts to stay and he's been trying to get that CS at his throat without giving up too much play damaged minutes go early on he refused to get money through the to replace exactly and if you know if you're not able to accomplish by Vladimir will hit a point where you're at level nine you have for your Kindle gem you have your feet by senior CTR stacking up and you can't pressure of any more damage look at me through it level five. Doran's Shield make an easy the same there's the rank 3 Q heels again and Broken Blade is still staying alive and how to restore it so he'll stop being denied for not being denied so badly either is your bushes down whatever things he can in his mid lane wait to see the next round of Brie causes Jensen in Jacksonville to the top of their first purchases and very deep in enemy territory right now and XFinity peeing on this wreck side in the top back they're going to find the guy Michael's thrift store better adhere Team Liquid okay to use Flash early on in the game there was no way out for acadians RTL are able to make that collapse and shut down early game of this rek'sai getting rid of some of the movement office as well as he pops the blastco turn ensures that that top jungle is not going to be too exciting but I kill one more time he's spotted us going to get out earlier they are peed out on Acadian they knew you was going in here at Smithy use it to flat stone still has the EQ left over and they're able to pick up that kill without expending any Summoners up their own broken play try to fight back and Noah Pratt that makes I pretty easy can't get the last in power to off but still HealthPark Damage Done in fact o t was teleport list little harder time and is laying down with that like steel and it's starting, unless you're certainly in the past I would have said this vs play The Group Inc that sells mean your slippers for we have seen a couple times in the playoffs are very well may be a bit of a hybrid build and what it does give you is a bit more of that sustained when you are going to be in this poke matchup if you rush quote about you can't get out today if you can't get poked out and help you have more staying power Dragon start up here by Team Liquid Xfinity on the bottom side with a control board and a pushing bottom Lane means that Team Liquid will turn their eyes for the first objective of the game and claim Cloud Drake that's a video on the clouds feet of the finals so far this is Betty picking this one up no problems there Smite gets the honey fruit able to walk away pretty easily and look at this game nine hundred to a thousand pound for pound on papers. You the better players and Laney phase is going their way now for a dive by side only very well played Zoe Redemption I do believe
Team Liquid from ear now switching side CSM Away Rise and something else enjoy yourself a plate into the early stages and I'm so excited I could put him in a favorable matchup against Broken Blade and see if he can make something workDSM gave to Broken play the last time around in the play the fact you was down early he's certainly turned it on late and it was not even one huge place around this way for this squad cleaners for later on and look at the band position on the right side in game 1highly probable here for TSM in the first round on liquid Side by it personal pics when you know that that is coming it's some sort of kill laying in the bottom side because we are excited to have grapes are saying they have great Polk and drawn-out Lane if you can burst down the swishy Champion than that may be a way in spring come out for before we know he's done for blitzcrank but it's around your time and windows of your Tarik ultimate coming. So these three Champions we've already being used in the ALCS extremely effectively this what is the permutation used against TSM by Cloud Nine this is how Cloud9 btsm with it though it's pretty picshear it hear it again around that bottom Lane for a case to be able to because you are always very quickly there a lot of possible kill targets if it's part of the jugglers are well-equippedafter that wreck site and hecarim can have very very potent effect on that bottom side Maps however number to hear focus on the silver lamp. See you soon as one of the team's most known for irelia Broken Blade of course they are here in liquid that is coming to watch out for it. I'm also going to be really interested in something like illusion or corky and I have seen those solid composition to be very effective as you go later on to the game or so much protection or that Mark thenfailure of his career spans of Court impressive as well intellect over and what is it going to be actually Aurelia for the way, your way I love this place throw down if you have a hacker materially a flying inveterate ultimate Lux ultimate coming over top to someone like this or the apps you don't have those moves that is incredibly threatening is going to help me pull a sea hear yourself if you catch someone they're probably going to die especially at 7 you're talking about these offensive plays good junglers have so much pressure on their shoulders early on in the game you can stove off pretty much anywhere on the map exactly as you have to play with almost less respect I feel to the jungler in a way that you have to know that you're so I cannot be everywhere these are volatile matchups you can't play with fear you can't expect is everywhere what area of the map is under attack now there's a chance probably the greatest player of all time in Bowie Let's see how it goes for game 2 since franchising since this new iteration of Team Liquid they have only known winning in the finals already TSM have delivered them a single loss and looking to take over the series will the veterans stand strong Acadian first into the pixel price year into the river defensive openings for both sides feels like there's so much pressure on TL two have Effectiveness in the earlier stages of this game know when you're looking over at csm's composition their 5e 5 late-game should be incredibly dumb and there's so much protection so much shielding and healing that is going to come through between box Derek and Sona and there's there's nothing to be found on the TL side there's no one that is going to be too hard for them to knock down no takes in this game my friend this is all about who strikes first you land your Scotia you get your kills lots of Firepower on both sides very likely to be Warrior 24/7 backroom Forward Motion hear Acadian how does Harry restauran the wreck site and still looking fruit Kilz despite a one-in-four squirrel and a certain point was a positive factor in the champion the Kindred band pays off the wreck site I get to hack for any way to Katie should feel comfortable here and we've got to remember the last time we did see this against TSM it wasn't sure how it got credible gate where he was a very far ahead of that fade background looks so so powerful. Should have the early advantage and in the power so we'll see Smitty can make it a different story here against Acadia Harley Poe put a better trade for his van actually and he lands the auto attack and get the extra gold for by here comes the pope for core jjq start and he's going to get his golden, I think it's both scale very well with ability power and gold again for people who haven't seen this quite yet been terrorizing solo queue it's been throughout Pro play but they kleptomancy and they spell thieves on the Sona not going for the answer is a paid at smoothie to Flat knowing you would not just throw out the dads out there for no reason and that is going to give Smithy time to get double Scuttle here and it got this bottom light has to play off of pressures I asked so so strong Atlanta get you can protect them from pot smoking such an early recall of in fact definitely a rough situation to be in there for impacting likely will have to expend his teleport that wave is going to push away from actually stacked it if you walked back to his way it's also a bit closer to CL500 impact going to have to pee pee back and now Broken Blade will shift into pushing boulder he's going to try to reset this way to get his phone face off and potentially save that TP Advantage what's faster while he's doing it and it's been three years since Lux was last scene of the ALCS bjorksten this is his kind of freaking is Zoe Jensen thought it was heimendinger yours and brings in the Zoe just going to pick did not look very good erection almost always looks amazing on this final stage ginseng it to grab his title Pearson almost always the one who has stopped him that is Jensen ubu City Altec at that first title fee has been chasing that for years and thought this was the squad to win with you all right tracking the junglers as they're going to be so important in this early game Xfinity the time is 1 in baiting into Acadian Pride of the jungle did not get the pink with a passive quite yet and tries to track him down but to slow spot some now but it's definitely too late for me to go back to results of the Jungle and take himself that frog Camp he was trying to take advantage of the distinct recalls there with Purex and back and bass recalling on the luck for the office to play it definitely win the ones you want supposed to be later can come over but Acadian if she has them to avoid the early attempt and disadvantage for Broken Blade on the top side it's actually quite significant because when you're playing a pushing to be to pot Lane you don't have to be so scared about the G6 heliports on the top side of map Broken Blade could be Jeeping behind you could come in and punish you especially with the Flash what I meant you talk about Lane leave this spot Lane difference is massive keep my Teryx is a primary farmer you can compare smoothie do double for actual C is in the land. What is doubling him right now that are not allowed to farm against ask Cyrus he's missed a lot right here so it will be just let's go over all the point of this and then paired Discounters pick in the bottom side Broken Blade the story for the topside there you can see continuing to go for it Smithy does pick up the shuttle crap by Stryper text impact on that very important split push as they do get close to the level 6 possibility that is where the cannon really has to worry Aurelius level six all in Kill bread must be warded again then not quite helping with all those last it's right there 25 to 44 the farm difference that pink Ward will keep them safe for now and that is quite a bit of time invested while said he was taking cops cuddle recalling resetting that would damage here in the mid lane but that's still alive I think you can see by Jensen salt cool down there he just went for one of those old plays activate the portal and you should probably just Lance's there at the initiation point of the cash point they are getting him on the return of the Roar. Huge big amount of damage traded through and see if it turns into any sort of Midland control the wards around this area do I allow the junglers to get so much more movement off speaking also of those level six all in Ash's Ira is reputed for that certainly the ability to actually hit that ass off Arrow guaranteeing the route from zaira Karen TV also will they had they're going to hit Level 6 faster very likely event in smoothie will have to be very careful smoothie is not immune to time here exactly with a rek'sai you can go for a tower. Killed a soda before the tereck ultimate iwan fals all the way down expecting continuing to invade here with Jensen after the play Bush they got the wards and Acadian there's no vision on this Redbox so they're not going to go for the smite that it's Betty Who grabs it and look at the difference here 700 gold up 14 liquid and I was going to forcing keep printing money later on that Prospect and can never go away can keep that going later about the top-flight once again but it's still look at how good looking pretty solid impact doing very well for himself once again meanwhile jugglers not able to get any big early action down I do believe this favors Acadian on the head from approaching the level six hair but again as we keep mentioning power. Possibility of topside fix up to the Cross will it be for a broken plate throw down pretty low and that you could be to kill had to flash the price speaker for it would have been a death. I did not want to get marked and Acadian couldn't quite get in front of block that one in time so it's on the top side and that opens up possibilities we do have a snow at level six directing to be very close behind and that is that window tlr going to be look
I'm ready by Trey Quinn and we have had two very close but it has been PSM coming out on top when it counts Broken Blade has been very effective last game but really it was the DSM play together was fantastic and game number to a question to ask to be what are the changes we are going to make to change the course of this series so far Target against Molly again band away one thing I would like to see Team Liquid doing it either a drafting to protect SS in the team fight for be giving him a champion that has more safety Morphin team won ND to he was left on a champion without a move block getting Jova take it down time and time againthe same six band is game one that's very versatile bottom Lane Champions and bring crowd control to the rest of the Deep V cropped up here this often means TL should be able to take the time tent for Olay or rather to excuse me for court today I feel to protect doublelift here so that will give him a little bit of this. Back to back pain and games as a not really translated into success in the later stage of the gamegalio is one of the Champions to pair with callista you can pull the galio out when the guy that you can make with these two champs they dress up to onto can look great for everywhere all the time not only saving people as well as they are really going to be now because the block has been getting Phase 2 Band out by TSM in both of those early game that will be a switch the GP also found out in those Faith 2 bands by TSM sois going to Blind it right ear and it's still save their last pick now to pick 4 kill counter fit for tsm's bottom side was outstanding can be really difficult actually here for GP not only if you have the auto tax be able to knock down the barrel of kill pressure Post 6 there is the potential to dive and take down this guy especially if you do get a strong diving alongside it later onbottom Lance and then it broke and play plays as he has done so far this series and had to advance with Vladimir Things become tricky something like a built-in protection as well with this podcast so I do like the beginning of this rap because it's feeling more of that kind of regular people think she has the mostCorky bands now a way as well looking at Mid laners that you might see if your expense Play Once Jensen at the blind pick his own Champion still have yet to see it done with the post office and gets first dibs and so is it going to get banned away because there were very worried about the galio Darvin combo less concerned perhaps about the erect size that could actually come out graphic novel of water Bjergsen blinds made what does Jensen have additional physical damage in the lineup but you know it's very very interesting they're really prior to fix I'm curious to see what it'll be 6:30 facing off against corner with the area of the spires and the possibility of pulling in and locking up that one is powerful carry this stuff if you go forward and get pulled in verifying what are the biggest kind of school doesn't allow her to go for the dead has been a classic but it's just going to be The Hobbit and syndra will be Jensen's Choice into the block looking for the paper I must note on Pierce and he's going to go to Cinder play Rex I will be here 14 years has the spikes in der has the old and starter the same so they can certainly pick up at least one the question is what comes on afterwards he liquid a tremendous amount of CC here to write all 3 of The Carrie from T-Mobile to that Alyssa relatively short-range and they have a lot of dive and a lot of pick one thing that people ever look for with missed it is avoiding versus a loved one direction especially with very capable of going for those burst skill earlier but if you have lot of her into DP there is diving kill potential Post 6 that is much higher now with the Red Sox who can also reset TOUR Championship with the pool and the wrecks I ought to go for something I really like to try to survive Team Liquid have to make the most of this moment this time right now they have to turn the series around every finals has been 30 lacrosse 2018 backs against the wall famous to reverse sweep that TSN pulled off in the semifinals played here in North America that's such a paradigm shift here now for impact in this toppling heading to meet is a champion that needs to be Lane dominant and I feel it GP is better suited to impact play style it is still that carry but it is where you can withstand where you can stay back and contribute to the team elsewhere just survive that is I think where he has had in North America he has been a monster we'll see if this is enough to make the difference cuz so far they series Broken Blade has been the one to dictate Aspire picked up by TSM early and ghost poros are traded 15 gold 2 piece down there's going to feel solid Team Liquid doing some other stuff on the top side is Timothy will is very best to keep his farm up here both these Champion should have gray fast furious does the mid laner start to trade blows in Ghent and jewels the first damage to the game then some looking here for some aggressive positioning up by the mail a minion with the ques but jurickson pretty quick me it's worth noting down here in the bottom Lane neither of the Marksman do you have TP this time around we haven't seen teleport every game from doublelift and Ben to will be double combat Summoners on both sides and not only that Sven has gone with the hail of blades to list up this is super Lane dominant in addition to the extra attack speed here well actually was take a look at this jungle intervention first he is he's got to worry about what could be to knock up as well as an extra extra read these cleared City beer can get that link control nice got other week but once you get that link control it means that Acadian to just take that Scuttle because if you commit to it from Smithy Master room reclaim TSM getting topside Scuttle as you know look at this bottle and fresh looks pretty good for cleaning liquid site that we can play so aggressive cuz he's got a ton of cash by his side even and exhaust on that support so the backline diving that has work so well for TSM and stop that would be a really play the game that will be happening here anymore to be a much easier to fight for him and that might make a very big difference in this game and take me to get the bottom side Scuttle crab as well for some more security here for the pushing of doublelift and corejj everything is go down it will be a farm lead on the team liquid side but there's really good trade back and I do really like the to be to hear from tli favor that much of it is just that straight match up there having to ditional range the ability to poke what's a ganglion cyst on the side of the smu's very very strong with the gal you end the callista so that is why it's so important to track a warning about and knowing where he is at level 6 power in the middle and once again checking in on Jensen and Bjergsen again to scatter the week supposed to be used reactively countering the Distortion damage from the LeBlanc Jensen so far has been able to stand tall in the minion wave he's getting the push down as well get Acadian the wrecks out here to give him that option of what he would play as the final pick and that is a lot of pressure I feel like on Acadian to be able to perform here if your sim put in a tougher matchup in also a lot of trust in a guy who's in his first playoffs you have more time MVP that's giving up his counterpick to get you the right side and it's always been able to do that half of the course there's semi-final win over Cloud 9 as well I will give Broken Blade the counterfeit just blind for me I'll hold up no matter what and Garrison has been a better than Siri beat him in the finals of white how good he is by his teammates this time Jets on him he's got 15 to make it work but so far I've hit quiet in this series is first trophy on the line in three straight I guess the player who's been more than him every step of the way pretty low how far is for both Marksman down here on the bottom side without a lot of sustained left so double it then spend very very cognizant of the enemy junglers trying to keep track of uncle passing this early on and not playing too far up the farm so far so good for empaths it's grass because it's just an overall pick up what you want a bit nicer this time but did not spot it's been 1/2 HP now he is seen by the word controller turns it off but they know he's here back lace TSM no gang to be happy but now safety required and I do think the grass is really intelligent choice you not even just for the lady but if you're parking at constantly building up a beer face of Health be able to survive the potential in because we really does want to look for those sort of flies now both jumpers playing Gear around Midland Spotify that you will be now Bojangles have been alerted ghostbar on Ward doing their work here but Acadian on the right side does get priority over the bottom side River will head down to join smoothie making his return down here is achates the fog of War those words are gone I answered back good flash away just like that TSM pull off the first blood and the money given over to this Rex I accelerating the warrior accelerating the level six year for Acadia this is been his Champion it certainly has and that takes so much because I think it's a gray Health goes off their bike it's turned around on this van and smoothie we're both really low again he'll have played better for Lane phase than lethal Tempo you get the quick three otters out stack of those beers smoothie got the CC chain in the immediately rip those beers out with the ignite down pull off the kill and now it's just as the level six. Come in for impact Uso gang play Cold as you if they don't get that kill if the great health goes off then that is going to be a lot expended certainly a lot of confidential by TSM and also select crowd control their that was just want to talk directly into knock out there was no chance at all for corejj to actually get that gray help off so just perfectly done now it is starting up the dragon honest fire starter is so good I take you down this track of a DSM is moving over here to your double if the same
but with the first two wins out of the gate but just in the nick of time Team Liquid stand strong rely on the team play and they're able to pull it out veterans have to be able to extend the series and I'm so Keen to see what the annotations maybe in draft airport DSM will they first pick the Tom Kent away perhaps will they early Bantu GP they do that is my guess. What else do you have because that certainly look very good for in the series and Sam is likely going to force them to show us something new so contrasting the game through the band's only changed slightly TSM dropped they added the force as the Tariff on here that's the combat TSM ran when they are on blue side of will they dropped at Chase or the lysandra neither any game in the series has always beenliquid has always been lysandra and now it's up but now you can get a trade write you any smarter ban if you can grab right that's a great answer not only but also to the lysandra herself so I think that this is a pretty smart band from Seattle and we'll see how we can actually work his magic good roaming on its ya throughout spring split has been one of the big Champion Borg Erickson for TSM Champions on the side of Team Liquid as well go ahead this the first time in the draft that has been more successful overallscomes in for Smoothie as helpful answer and Leo will because I really can only threaten kind of those all in the training is very poor from the champion especially against who can get those stacks on you if you do go in by real question is still just like All Eyes On Top Lane they're going to Blind Pig there is Gillian Welch excuse me they're going to be here but they will likely save impact Pick 4 last and what that will be may very well kind of decide if it's made of his series I really like liquid I don't believe that he can do that again revived the team edge control was very good in the lane in a Cinderella he was up far but that was not about him that was about the team fighting and I think this is going to be more support towards doublelift to really is a starcall this team the guy you want to bump up the guy you want to protect him they're going to have a lot of different ways to shut down any potential to go to Broken Blade if he has a counterfeit ready for the zillion Rod those are also very big pics for me I would say it's pretty risky to send lesandro Top Line because I think that tank connector that incredibly well Alessandra is not someone who steals very well in the 1D One it's generally more about the early game and that's not really been the style that GSM has been kind of going for they have been playing very often stealing fix for Broken Blade where you can Farm up in that side lane and become a Monster yeah I really do like both of the options of the akali and of Vladimir for them that being said she will be able to save the last year on right sideone final band 40s time will it be in with a jungler yes kind of hecarim dropped off the table you do if your play top into a truck we know we can play jungle pretty successfully and it's one is removed also it has really good synergy I do like scar here though I think it works very well for them last time and also again you talking about Jamie that has synergies with speed he went Predator his glory dead man that is all about speed and billions are going to make that even more effective and as expected it will be the last pick for impact this is going to be the rest of the cam coming out here then as usual trying to get into Jensen's head would be quite a safe option but you can't do expect veristat the run that lane as far as pressure goes then back on Comfort he spends good at the champion and regret not saying it back in their series get up and it will be fixed now really intense me a picture of a colleague of course but can gain w02 in the series with that champion all right did I have obviously put a lot of practice a little bit of extra juice extra damage coming for a man but broken play it has also been so good on the akali that's why they're willing to Blind Pig at for him but I will say still they have that for online that have so much protection for double if so don't have to be as much pressure on impact in those team fights it can't be him actually zoning people out free space with the ultimate attack. This game is going to be so much about the duration of all these I'm in Windows akali shroud lesandro ultimate both also buy time also come through at least hit through shroud but this is going to be a very tight one here liquid have one one do more straight to get that trophy its three titles in a row something that only TSM has accomplished here in North America have to be champions of all gone the TSM already we'll see if York soon we'll get number 6 and his teammates can get there first and North America he's the only one to take that title so far LCS spring finals 2019 continue as a players load in game number 4 with a Terminus DSM takes it home right now or flick would bring us the game 5 last remarks from the coaches summoner's Rift the loading up the fans are ready so are we going to be damn sure the players are two TSM for Team Liquid best in the LCS never more hotly contested split so much on the line it feels like four players across both of these squads trying to prove themselves as New Rising player trying to prove themselves as a long-standing veterans in these leaves and it's going to be in so much about teams to win lyrics to get lyssandra until now they thought more was important in this draft we know he can be deadly on this Champion Tony play Styles available to him this one going to be these set up the rest of the squad and during spring split often times when we saw this was before TSN he was invading with a KTM flasher early you can see Brazilian record that there are four Jensen 9 and 1 his one lost to who else lyrics in Yelp all of that coming on cloud nine with their classic combination with their Kindred much less offensive oriented jungler this time around billion and Starner. Duo definitely not but if you're going to have to be terrified that Rex IQR impact you are now flashless potential to Rome up there from bjorksten Acadian certainly a very strong early game don't work here on the wrecks I in there going to have to be extremely careful about getting behind in that matchup against colleague was one of the best snowballing champions of the game I think I was been having to leash it does make the bottling push go easily Team Liquid the way they have control over how they want this one to play out expecting to get bottom schedule looks like without much as she was there actually went all the way down for the Crux of every Power clear start for Acadian Miss doublelift core JJ verus Tom can't do a last time do successful doublelift feeling much more confident now throws in a little taunt which events which is it up goes for the Ezreal pick way harder to punish them Nicholas stuff certainly one of the reasons you saw has been fall so far behind is because I shall reign for they looking for attention now afraid of what a double, with you he's got TP not cleanser barrier so could have been a kill straight up a little too and you know Rex size top side there's any is up yeah. Just have to wait for the claw as soon as this up he can Flash into started off the timer 3 Jensen nose look at his position in so far back the closet very slow-moving yeah takes the pole but Jensen far enough back minnechaug was fighting over control of this one little pushed away is Jensen moved over that way first and there's timer slowly take away but early some of the advantages here now for CSM in both of us olanes it will mean that these guys are going to have to play more carefully and no as in fact you want to be playing aggressively on the Canon you want to be in that guy's fade frocking or klepto trying to harass him down and you don't really have the option to do that without your Summoners it's too risky of a play and then once broke his leg gets to that level 6 very scary all in potential who seen him pull it off time and time again are there at least for now impact does have the farm lead people to queue from long-range to stay safe as well wait time it again Travis Lane does play out of 50 is topside I got no flash for the 10in can make it more difficult to pull off but in case there's a die if he's around and then out goes the recalls mottling actually slightly before his van got more to farm the same as I closed the game was the previous yeah sitting back on Ezreal see you safely and effectively just trying to find out the Mystic shots not going for a lot of Trades what's happening on Minion is best Champion I think so far this little first what are the Jets into I want to see this replay from the TSN Vision side because it looks like there was a moment of hesitation when they saw the starter coming down mid lane then still went for the flash hopefully we can see that in fog of War because it feels like it was a bit of an over commitment their team liquid get the funnest thank you observers here it is for the team until they both had perfect timing by the collapse yet again around them it later and they have a huge punished enormous with the TV coming in also from doublelift behind there's a new there's no way out so we just have to run into the turret and then try to not give up another assist but certainly huge 40 lb cuz we know the Sounder wants to be out of her late he wants to be roaming if you fall behind a zillion you can get into a situation we're just walked in your lane where is infinitely and you're just stuck that won't be one never getting to get to the silence and that was with some other Advantage both flashes burn that was both been dying so TSM on the back foot cooldown wise you can see Team Liquid up 1200 really hoping that reverse sweep home for the title they put the team together for Now is really the last window now zillion level 6 Santa can hold on to that ultimate you can overlap those food at the flash in the ultimate survivability just chugged away on a corrupting potion as the catalyst is just too difficult to make room there so she need to change their focus no longer Midland need to create something else where on the map they will have a little bit of an edge to that bottom land because it uses TV to mid lane so now they are going to have to keep his bandage they're going to lose a couple of minions as a result but I certainly nothing massive than you can even look now with Mickey at 6 to actually hack Yorkton yes he can go for a self ultimate but if you do that it set up so easily for the Devil by the zillion you can actually Altamonte starter and sitting in one place setting for the double bomb that way there's so many ways them to chain that Cece and really lockdown bjork's and who is going to kind of be behind the curve as far as that damage profile go back to the Lenny face now but so far they're okay game still 1500 apart and Siri calls come through to your she could recall that has done this year as well and I think we're going to see if actress Rena Prussia Morelos Unifour this matchup otherwise you have no chance of actually pushing the akali out you need that Grievous wounds is very very heavily in with the Ruby Crystal as well. And tell him that is my gas and we'll see a piercing can try to get out of Lane to put a swing these things around is 3 man squad up on the top side would be devastating and they're heading for impact okay flash is up told you the same here's the teleporting for one and with that cool down I'll go see a sent but that's still around that for as they call them for the mid laner the long road back to Midland yes he's going to run into the wrecks I guess I'm have warts down through the Team Liquid jungle
when's title after title and we are the champions du Lac D liquid shows read the emerged with a recent success of Team Liquid smithy's starter the point-and-click CC the point-and-click CC denial slaps up if your TL I think you just trying to run back basically the same draft but yes NM could be saying the same thing there it is Tomcat the band makes a lot of sense that has been enabling double of so much in these last two games where he has been a monster leaves of the Kindred use before commonly known as a side pick soccer is picture you can go Kendra zillion as an answer to thatwill more points be put on this Barracks both theme succeeding with that as their bottom Lane Cary galio returning as the first pic though does half the globe does have cost for the double knocked I don't think they have to protect Alessandra Jensen does not traditionally much of Alessandra player he doesn't really prefer that champion as much but I still think I may have an opportunity to grab it in their next couple pics and unit Fiel does go for that is Justin Blythe picking lysandra into York Senate has given him the option to deal with thatwell all liquids wins have been on the back does Varys and Tom kench one of those has been denied a very still up if you think it's probably in consideration to be graphed right here start or actually hovers early on with every other jungler available they want the impale a lot of their picks have come off the back of Xfinity finding me as hell but also good at clearing good with the fires around the neutral object if you're going for that has given them quite a lot of security and I think it dition leave your sin and Broken Blade have both been putting a huge priority on Champions who rely on Mobility for their success when you're looking at a rally would you look at that collie look at all these sorts of Champions just say no then the very least okay well Zoe was Victorious for Pearson early on the hybrid Vigor didn't look too good right now and find a counteraction do you take those verus to make sure you got that I think they can just go zillion again it ain't nobody makes a lot of sense but there's a lot of areas that you could go for instead we'll be putting that pressure on himself game 5 it is hemp versus beer to the he has the counter pick and wants to Black this lame of this counterpick is all about tank setup and we'll be able to choose the initiation on to Zoe but they don't have a lot of coordination here to pull this off driving to move sibert now removed as well as wait to see what exactly Devil's going to play nose against Ezreal plus galliano's Brom is on his teeth loosen trauma certainly someone that can be there if you ever does step up did you get that super late when you have a lot of items in the Krypt Marksman are scaling up so we'll see if doublelist Alexa's go back to the Sarah 60s m going to leave it up once more reason not to as it had a lot of success busbar the only real question there is enough playing fairest without the Tomcat right because maybe he wants to make a move back to a champion that has more Mobility like the Lucian he was not the test was the first two games when he didn't have that safe GSM not showing any dive right now give it to me LCS finals Betty goes with a Kaiser that is going to add a lot of extra damage and also be able to assist in kind of diving back you know if you hit a starter ultimate onto the dead girl all of a sudden finish off that pic was DXM stay true to what they found Success With broken plate on an independent Champion for the top side and big questions about what we will do. The answer is a collie will he go to yet another carry with a lot of these people and Carries already fanned out has gone to GP is gone is gone will he go back to a very curious to see where the direction will be going with full Comfort year for all of their players impact would be huge I do think you're 10 actually answer collie quite well but you do have to be careful about Futsal is that okay or will be the option the team by 40 L will be brutal later on in the game but there a half to get there first as you certainly think a lot of these Lanes there is ability to recognize to do and pack them in and have a big early yeah I mean Brooke had such a big game for TSM on Vladimir not impact and turn the tables and run it back on them simply has a lot of back line access Team Liquid team play their coordination with teleports as what brought them here brought us here the game number 5 and if it were the last words from the coaches the last guidance they get it's now down to attend the players on stage their instincts their preparation their training and how well they can do now when the pressure is on the trophy on the line the title in St Louis bands before the championship number 6 for Pearson and doublelift score JJ the spring split MVP use on Prime now impact pushed to a bladder that carries so hard from his opposite member broken played his first time in North America on another carry this time the akali and smoothie he lost his games cracked under the pressure now is the time to show up and prove that you were the best team in North America are you purchase liquid what is the final game for the ALCS championship can ask for more than this from these two teams who have played their hearts out already both teams showing really strong performances and the tide has shifted in this last games to Ward's TL but 10 TSM Riku can they bounce back and kind of reset their mental after too rough can use both teams settling on what works for them so far Team Liquid back to this Garner TSM back with your ex I Azrael Zoe just the fact of scrutiny was spamming taunt actually gives me some some faith in his mental that he's not so television on the game that you still feels a bit loose and the Third Estate you need to be in to play at your best pressure of course is going to be a word tossed around a lot when talking about this series Team Liquid poised to win 3 straight not just games but LCS titles DSM so few teams that you Stave off the reverse sweep they got to do it here if they can do it if TSM can win this Championship this year they will have more championships than all other LCS teams combined and they will answered all questions the bracket the day of the go through they had to beat the ruling five-game series now Going the Distance your against TL certainly all questions will have been answered the Middle Lane is clear the way perfect PS4 Jensen it's always a good sign when you're back there call First Take play sleep and chain at the same time apparently even trade in the heel is still available because how to use against no we without being level 3 she can't steal it back and trade the damage so much if done before she can hit you back with it and again LeBlanc always looks for the gang set up in this matchup with Zoey can go Distortion with the chains allow and started to close that distance not usually a champion that can have an early impact Katie and knows this on the wreck side circling around using the passive transfer onex50 opens up on the Raptors and the junglers see each other for the first time this game with out of work pants a little bit of gold and if it's meth who takes and retains control of his side of the jungle 13216 overall jungle CS meanwhile bottom Lane doublelift is gone with the cleanse on caixa this time around he does not have court jha on the top 10 sport of our extra Summoner here for later on in the game so it will mean TP Advantage for TSM right they have that barks and with the teleporter 10 answer Side Lane Blaze double if not going to have that luxury is it from Valley of way too threatening and even that sleep from Zoey 10 mean certain death if you don't have a cleanse available or someone to block it was on the track a later on if I'm at please don't matter and it comes down to do you fight someone extra combat Summoner that you mention if it is Matt slays than TP can mean a lot more will wait to see that one play out supposed game of course the early laning phase impact wish to Vladimir here got his Pickens Broken Blade so far farming off of very small death of Vladimir but nothing to write home about just yet middle an advantage to Jensen that counterpick working out quite well Grace afraid here from Broken Blade that's fine the extra damage early on impact is trying to see us and he'll back up off the minions Billy took the first record of the Jungle of course with Predator you want Foods ASAP and I will die and they will stay pretty close and far too pretty good at Power clear now that they've increased the range of the spires can even do the crugs no effort required now that everything has been cleared back out onto the map trying to get the Jeepers Vision he gets award over the back of the wall by the topside broken play finding another trade also really worth taking into account that isn't ocean first dragon right so that is assuming this is very very big I think on the minds of both these two teams if you can take that that is eliminating a lot of the threat of this poking unaware down from others. Garner is definitely a champion capable of soloing the Dragon first Predator is activated for xmithie looking towards the bottom side but smoothie and Sven back off as the minion wave moves up good communication and caution here in game number 5 no mistakes will be allowed here you're the Alice has talked to the fact that game 5 would probably be slow or how I brought it up is the pressure mounts and you know what mistake might cost you the entire season it's so much on the line but at the same time in those situations sometimes it is the first time I had the confidence to go aggressive the confidence to make that play that can decide the game right if you sit back too much if you always get the opportunity to be that playmaker to your opponent then certainly they can't make good on it and there are so many players here in the series that are going to be able to look for those sorts of plays the guys who have the confidence to do it Broken Blade certainly one of them constantly looking for those opportunities Katie and himself going for the invasion jobs at Ward has Moscato out he goes first recall comes in To Kill a gem plus the dark seal a potion to stay in and CD are the required how do you want to see Acadian still in keeping that faith in himself yes they did have a rough couple last two games but he has had the success he has had by playing aggressive by being in the face of his phone has been trying to stop that you have TP Advantage they're going to use as real teepee to come over here has got a robe over as well so he has the inside first couch with the bubble this is Ocean trade super Leon goes to TSM that is very large taking the first play for themselves that guy sitting back as hell TSM are out of their seats if you try to commit to that fight fully broken play too busy being in behind you and you could get wiped so they had to give that respect over to him exactly in the last game teleports on display through route this time around GSM making use of their advantage early on really being a far better player in Ocean Drake is just absurd for Lenny face here and put mana on Sandy keep going for that can you poke a walk this one away but I just hold down and I did also have his magic damage Shield Brock there from the room so that is another little cost do that trade in broken plate does the
pirate beard earlier on of the countdown till he gets a good somatic here for the day and worked out well for him it's time for an upset and Team Liquid doing battle back then I was asking was all inside of T Allen and talked about those matches being in their favor played a couple weeks ago and there is always the possibility that CL is not evil play the Terrors of Carrie toppling style where they have struggled the time we got to see what the traffic going to give us and talking to some of the players and staff members they think this is going to be a lot more set a 3 o clock West have been looking very strong recently well as Team Liquid ended the split with quite a few losses let's get into it though letendre where the band ripe off the table gear from pobelter this guy has been doing so much work for flyquest roaming around setting up he made really playing wellVictory there but it means that what they want to play was showing that gives you look at the release doubting as we haven't seen T elfland 9.6 yet we saw flyquest tested all the way to gain 5. Comic Con going to be a little bit helpful on the band facing Gangplank and Silas dropped away from Impact giving him the building is as you can mention does playoffs how much of that is really indicative of their level of play how much that was being a bit lacks is in Taco table this morning that's the question I have some people were saying people work in the Team Liquid kind of supporters saying that oh well they already locked in first of course they're going to experiment of course they're going to do these different things the days is one of those experimentations that wasn't really working out as well for them. So seriously if it is that the kind of place all if they want to chill will see if impact 10 deliver a betterdo I do here today against Viper who is such an excellent care vs. carry toddler I kind of like opening with a J fikry because Fiddler's to yesterday where are you open was eat Eric Stone a bottom land that if it does working Gameboy then you can receive some more section band looking for throughout the series what if it flops on his plate so well last week and grab that one no problems to look at time to round up breast milk composition I increase to even seeing bottling pics later and later on to the bathroom a longer flight those same face blinds at all ready to go in game one we saw yesterday Cloud 9 full. And game number one to get a win over to you and empty at Sandpiper out how they were not ready for that naked band out the rest of the. But again if you can get a win in the first game like this that can earn you some extra credit for the band later in the series it does have to work though and they are blind pickingbottom Lane at the Fort they playing that galio and I've been hearing a lot of discussion from Frozen about the fact that they feel you can pick extremely kind of go to be greedy scaling a DS into this. Lame because they don't feel that improve play they should be able to find a few heavily in Lane things long line of cars mod Jinx they feel that you can get away with it and then just have Superior DPS when you do come to that late-game if you can survive to that point that we saw has been in smoothie they took the vein into it got people really killing Lane with The Condemned against the wall on the Sonos who is squishy and susceptible to birth and one of those big things yesterday with the composition of Cloud 9 and when they did have it on his hair was the tack room game on the acronym use multiple levels ahead of his opposing jungler he had the heart engaged with that champion to pair up with tarek and it really dobring the composition together by Mr eazi will TLC so much harder to use defensively then it is offensive and watching the steampunk play on it does feel like any of these Donuts are at comp are very mid-game focus when he has been turned off it was born but she'll start to fall off from there he's not going to stay late game impact as a five of them as real or thinks receiver for Tyson is kind of face soap from the bottom line can withstand the three items like in mid game start to feel better for them but you have to get through that against if it's the same and you are also, combining that with the chase early lethality Jason have a similar curve there and it's different damage types of a threat so stupid are putting together a very strong mid-game for themselves hereyou're going to have a really effective early to levels early but very very likely could be no Black Cleaver sort of style I do think I left there is very well with the character pin him in with your ultimate you can use the Dazzle off them with the Batman dingoes done giving me to call DC for the Oahu is to be really powerful in those early minutes of the game of speed and the Jace acceleration gate work very well for Olaf and Ken and as in gauges for the team to on the side of life Quest though they have also locked in the stowey for pobelter is game 5 winning Champion when he absolutely hard cherried for flyquest to get them here today he's on this once again there once again lexbee irelia up to Viper we talked about not even having that many recent games on irelia but having the confidence to play thatflags for the team and it worked out a credibly well now irelia vs Ken and top-end is one of the things people looked at as a possibility can healthy flyquest upset happen get the cable tray matchup let's play for hopefully one of experience was kind of camping with a bit of attitude on this kind of champion and we'll see if they can withstand the mid-game spikes and if they can get into the game and wildturtle to do the late game caring that he has been doing throughout the back half of the split start to go to the shake hands inverts always in front of the Silas year for the first 15 games you thought this is definitely the swatty 14 and 1 start but then a three-game losing streak Jensen doublelift core JJ blue Juggernaut in their roles in flag quest for the rookie top laner and a few new editions as well have Medics make top force and itspause rep here we are at house fashionable does Tara cluck leaving the fountain in here in the ALCS undefeated in the playoffs in Team Liquid or DeSean a little bit of something new you even though it's been seen before I have flyquest are going to hope that Viper on comfort and wildturtle the same to make another mess if I series Winn-Dixie Alfonso going to have some questions you know when to draft that you were expecting a d from TL doublelift I do not have the best history on Mages in the bottling This Is War similar to that style in fact not the guy you want to seelooking for two more shots to kill him we'll have to bring the flash someone here might be an impact auto shipping the real Flash on Zoe escape from the bottom side and that is Team Liquid already securing first plaid for their top laner impact on Ken and now is going to have the extra money to get more aggressive with a 5-minute invade on TL on the top side to try to get Ward's up there and they saw some members of seal on the top sides of DJ internal think it's safe to walk in your on the bottom side and get those Wards down but Jace as well as Eric waiting their Landing the double Bastion yeah running into the Terex done here they're able to land a Double JJ taking way too much damage there the rest of Team Liquidare here to help Corral him impact flashing over the wild out has expended here are going to need to be tracked by the junglers impact is a head-on Kenan and in the range match if you want to try and friend but without that flash GIF to be so cognizant of where is santorin Rex is a very potent ganker early on Can't Go For Those flash place is that is why impact right now is letting the minion wave sit in the middle and speaking of impact he did not get time to recalls the first blood does not affect the landing phase right now no extra items brought in here for the fight so it will still be a fairly straight up 1 V1 and again I'd mention flash down just like any for split impact text sleep a bit behind. I think he's going to have to hold on to that lighting Rush use it pretty defensively know when you are these awkward positions you want to make sure that you're not too aggressively because of the Jungle shows up you have no class you have no lightning Rush could be so susceptible to going downdr. Domanski in Central Coast Suites towards make sure that okay impact does it have to play with walk over here and since I know that when he goes for the shuttle will probably be by the Scuttle crab word that is so common by all teams on both of them so he'll know that he's been scouted if you do avoid all those words o r x I can actually go much more deep into enemy territory from from behind a funeral the topside not to be the case though she's been scouted and we'll go back to the Jungle to finish clearingit's going to be a camp and a half behind Zoloft right now it's a bit to use knockdown 6 consult still has a shuttle to take instead of his normal Camp straps the red spot under going to go back on the map never seen that happen for my jungler Toby so if you've done that either but it is efficient Focus year for Smithy goes for the power clear on Olaf just getting all the camps down this early then you go out for some Vision work and you come back to your jungle starting at that top again they will all be responding in line at higher experience and you going to continue your power to swing by the fat route to level six and you have a little bit of time here while you're waiting for them to respond to go get some invade done and other really kind of interesting thing about this donut are the bottom line is the axis double side phone says you're going further into the game and we talked about made game and that being a lot of power around that you can play even more effectively around injectors like the early Barons because you have two people to heal you throughthe damn show me the bear but also because you got the vision to be actually be able to set up an in kind of secure those objectives that'll be sunny me see you soon enough that you're seeing of course it is for today taking all the normal Farm as they wait for SS to finish this Quest and then once that's done to going to go to the back and getting all the gold and actually it was a losing a lot of farm up to the pushing of Sven and smoothie in this case for like or JJ JJ on the guitar on all series have not punished Eric's party that she's acting just as well as much more difficult when you have a male a champion at your side to try and punish the Terex own Elaine so that's why they were so confident to lock this in after seeing the galley O'Hurley you can't see the how this Lane and windproof Oak right and double it is going to be able to focus almost solely on this poking at Verizon he doesn't have to actually Farms you're playing the stone on every time total is actually going for a farm you can be frightening to step forward and letting that Poconos results Turtle has already he's been in his potion and is sitting about to Thursday this week not going to lose too much there but he'll stay safe for now is that what it's 14 Golden Pin walk back to safety and this lady really is going to be frustrating to play against if they can get you into a sort of poke battle because I only have their fashion filters Guardian Killzone a w also add the shields are in the phrase I just one of those things where when you're choosing to fight against it at the black ones lineup you have to be sure that you're going to be able to have essentially that lethal damage that you can actually fully finished them off or they will start to feel up at the same through those really can't look turn things around we just looking by the ward is the oil off of a Smithy and often times you feel safe when you have that drink it down because you think it sees them at all there is JJ does Flotsam easy walk out for the Olaf but that's really unfortunate committed the controller and everything and won't get the Drake yeah I got to be a little bit more sneaky it's only like a blast phone over the top or something JJ wraps around does find it absolutely no sneaky Dragon early on Santorum just cruising back to the top sites to see in farming here and no reward for the early play and speaking of rewards login to watch. LoL Esports. Com set for the entire series rewards for watching those games to make sure you logged in to watch the games you can even filter on Twitch past perfect credible yep and in the top when we do now know that it's going to be a peek at it very likely the revolver has come through and we just be yesterday actually gunblade Bill coming out on the tenant which I believe we appreciate that. Always is a triprotic all trash if you're going to go for the AP or soda more hybrid build on that I think is what would make the most sense with this sort of composition we were talking up make me Focus 2.0 belt AP dive in there getting all that damage down it makes a lot of sense that the volume a lot more specifically versus the Gangplank matchup irelia here in fact is going to be a bit worried about the all in Orillia now post level 6 had the wreck site as the jungle so for flyquest died this is one of the big area if you want to look at is the total length of your. On the Zoe isn't great at taking over game could get him an early lead and Phifer on the irelia this new guy rookie of the split for flyquest is on one of those Cari Champion's in a topside
thank you very much. Welcome to the battle arena game 1 of the quarter-finals is ready to go I Am David free the most inspirational fellow that I know I appreciate that very much is a good liar game 1 Astros Red Sox they means they must have to ban Silas is everyone does to your sister has dropped away from us well I think a lot of them is also looking at for a thrash band little bit of a throwback to Apollo and hospital last spring I'll be surprised if there's not even a hover in this game has been buffed up so heavily she's much more powerful in the bottom Lane actual place to Championor is it bring a little bit of exercise in a national event yeah that's what I could do the job right after top 10 right nowRussia smiling I love it and it looks like they are pretty good in the Jarvan because you can dodge the EQ fairly effectively as long as driving doesn't have a brunch place coming out of funeral fog of work the pride that you kind of like that match up and look at it really hover on a h boxes well so a lot of curly aggression as possible hear a truck generally a top laner overall but has a pretty good number of pause the bathtub to looking Frontline for the squad is got brown alongside so they can t fight with this they could buy them pretty well also they're not already taken so back line because that Kindred so let's do it TSN wants to do it for the second round of Banff already looking like a pretty decent team fight set up for a box with a couple of the delays there a chalk to revive Kindred ultimate going down but talking aboutthe main revive character of the game billion picked up for Buicks in or the Oggi's billion players yeah and even though you're know you as a place camping of a split game number 3 on zillion now for future experiments for 3rd Base we all wins does a CSM did they split the band Oasis top laners to make sure that those matchups feels pretty good one more to put to remember hearing High earlier and the countdown think the edge of a former vs TSM want to put him to the test to test it out in this series you know to the extremes Jake de Venta along with tack room for the Top Lane at top way in heck room has gained a lot of popularity and does not haveBerry Mini 4 matchup especially is good and a Truck specific licorice bring that one out last year at world so smart like a fox band the way though of course you'd be broken boy played on stage know it could be a possibility but then goes back with most play Tamil hits 7th as real game of the split more than double any other champion and there are lots of the balance that most people would rather play but it's been still on Comfort ye kind of me interesting here because even though during his time in North America people have been leaning on him for playing so much Azrael I really like one of those other most played Champions along with galio is Calista that combination is insane to me as your Deputy going to take a little bit longer to have a similar impact here and TSM are going to be a little bit safer with that big in 1/4 c r a 9.6 double tier will not be the build for the azreal but seems this time in luden's Echo or ruined King thordan it's not a problem at the hawk. Around out there line of their it will come through for Apollo out of his bookspictures always there is definitely a strong, going hard. Addicted with Joey and what will probably be at least a lady varice here for her I'll follow you definitely go both ways that the on hit build built extremely effective fresh every other side don't think of a truck stop laying around in power in that splitfoot something of the kind and whatever you see a Jack if you have early jungle fracture like that is going to be so much of setting up for later in the game explode on the pressure going to be interesting to hear rush I think is always a very confident player he's always going to feel very good about himself very first LCS playoff and heAuntie fm-84 expectations behind them so I are on a kidney if you can step up here and everything specifically ALCS playoff this is also Broken Blade first even though he has made the playoffs. What time is the L running this one now coaches shaking hands and DSM the guy get through Echo Fox got his age rock you got some good jungle pressure to rush too much to squat as well this is the test at the fox in a four-game winning streak including beating number 1 and 2 but tsm's only lost one gameTSM have gone eleven and one since Acadian created the meme about house with that their wrath will be but echobox did the one thing that TSM could not thus with they took down a cloud 9 to start off their four-game winning streak heading into play off both teams very prepared for this extra pressure and even those people are saying TSN are the favored team current form is what matters plant it is going to be a real thing we saw that a bit with Viper yesterday that lady still didn't come through with the wind is can be a very close match up here we've seen Phoenix really step up before he has been jerking people at times but we know the pedigree is TSM players and Sven years they've done so much with their careersand I'll see what the early game looks like he's been hoping for some free cleft lip go up not going to find it but I like the attempt you're always worth fishing around early game with Ezreal especially calves Ward protecting you on the topside pixel brush to be afraid of is of course prom very good level one but nobody going to group up here so no action just yet we have a door and she likes you for a follow looks like he's expected to get very little help down there he's playing for very expensive opener and the bottling pulled him to come through easily than the rest. There was rushing to get that without a problem and similar bottling full of a CSM side and I will see you where there jungles go as time moves on if I can fuck them to the 212 klepto gold Chacos going to move in a straight line that was too much for him get this correctly is betting on the bottom side for his Kindred first marks pain right here for the Scuttle read into frogs should be a pretty quickly or hear up past the bottom Lane no Ward was put down by the DSM to go by the way to see if there is a possible early is it from a level to read book Kindred but I was talking to be the case then the Mark has spawned on the top side so we'll see if the Katy can actually get there quick enough to feel it away or fresh just goes in a straight cuddle over to Scuttle try and take that again what we talked about here with injured in the Darvin especially early if David does not have a big Vision Advantage it's definitely super dangerous for the Darvin. Topside River there's two words put down at level one by the Equifax quad and probably can't fight yeah they know that this has been harassed as well it should be easy for Rush head over how does not have pushing Lanes to help them for a possible all in on the Kindred and it's very very dangerous should be picked up pretty easily as you can see broken plate on the Jacks going with rest of really pushing that laying in but he's going to have some vision of rush to know that you cannot further extend your soul has got the minion waving us very nice spot right in front of the which might cause broken play the drop some CSC are due to caution to watch you saw a rush try to keep that fell off the ski with a backwards he gets an octopus gets out of range and you can see that was coordinated with his jungler some communication just on screen right there for you broken play calling Acadian hey just passed by real quick so I can go try and push this in it doesn't get all the way in and fully reset though here so solo still has to wave in a very nice spot a broken plate does have to worry Kendra can make very creative Game Pass you can cue over back of Baron pichai and go all the way around so they're definitely still is the pathway and try and finish that wave should push back shouldn't be my teacher for the Jacks will see is that plays out though he's going to have to wait a couple of a waves doing every 30 seconds that you wait there for that to happen very very antsy enough but now that quickly is coming through Acadian do is on the bottom side and broken bow to be back under his Troy this game very close and Goldust Maldives right now Deco Fox quad to call that out 6 in that midlane + 6 / in the jungle as well as a pretty positive thing and right now it's been an equal trade a resource on the bottom side as we move closer close to the site stump mechanic in the farmer Leon and getting that First Market Lee positive on their side meanwhile everything calm on the bottom side there everybody just farming up as far as the klepto Sachs there's Bend Scott one slice I could go that I saw every single one does count when trying to find it your first year don't want to get your first back without a pretty big purchase you can go all the way to Pier plus beans if you are able to get a decent amount in Lane teleport is available and he had to been really harassed at all Brooker played trying to get a closer walk back up and won't miss too much Farms you want to point out you mentioned some of the spells in the bottom line it is PP for has been a cleanse for Apollo to deal with Shenanigans outside of galios Contour a double bomb out of the means that lay control to be easier for the Azrael side once again still able to get that backwards - 2q knock up to get out of the study don't play that match up pretty well and now holds pretty close here first ITP spent back in the middle as give you the same pretty recently been taken down goes more here looking for good for those who have pushing bottom Lane that you allowed to get that Mark before the arrival of driving or any sort of Lane support hear Rush definitely set up to have a very strong game near on the Kindred still level four for acadians Garvin and they don't have any Vision in on the dragons we actually called smoothie as you can see on the mini-map there to go Ward together and make sure that there's going to be no sneak on the dragon early on here because at Ocean Drake will have a very very big impact early on in the game pretty well not able to dodge the bomb don't sing a blow for him but not Midland Magic still Advantage Sports Phoenix in Russia that he can invade baby looks towards these chickens can you find some CS level five on Acadian now and that's not going to be a trade for the blast blanket Pops I might continue Farm analog the tension continuing to build here playoffs very very important for both teams TSM trying to have a combat gear from last year their worst year ever in this one there are two suckers Creek help or closed back down for Sven and he did get that big person if they were talking about the musketeer that's the best feeling first TV usage for the slain definitely is what you want chicken on Apollo's build me while it is cut list we is going for the standard on hit build with Todd Frontline there's not a gigantic tanks Galileo by being unloaded support won't be that much help in Jackson doesn't quite build backpack either but still have to assess the damages against Philip hornigold the freckled Fox overalls with stealing continues on and Phoenix heading down towards this out of an OP gets the oranges and might look for a guy and again at the scaling does continue here and we look at how do you say you can't pop zits for going to try and operate the TSM composition on the Jacks to be isolated whereas echo-fox one of you puff and make use of their folk damage there with the Zoey and of the Barrett right now because as soon as I even saw him down there you spell Acadian heading out of the base to the topside there was no intent for dsny how was that that dragon flame
them worked out extremely well and they were able to get some of the primary Champions that we've come to know for the flares atrox was such a tremendous bar in playing the weak side of the map for them and playing it very effectively also dominating a lot in teen twice before it's not quite yetall right so the governor of death going to be at the table here at the fox what it once again go for the early 80s rock snow and said Jarvan is up as the king of the jungle and that's been taken away so will you look at the roof first pic like we had talked about but is going to rush back on his driving his most played by a Lockton now Acadia play to the new in this series right the Gators game playing a game number one was take away the job and he keeps on playing it he must be reliant on it but me by having the Kindred in that match of it having the exchange of sides of the map Echo Park. Construction fig leaves with all that dragon in bottom side control definitely worked out in their favor the last time this was TSM picking the Galileo in the Jarvan will it still be support jungle Oblivion something different now we know driving is flexible but almost by the time he is a jongleur has gone top before knowing new looksplay to play hard and we had that with Robin Kelly on some of the things that people I talk about with your accent is how flexible of a player this guy is he played so many different Champions and critically so many different styles last game is on this billion you know it's a more defensive later 14 fighting very timing intensive lissandra he also plays very well looking for loans early on trying to push the wave quickly doing hard and gauges for the team he's had a lot just the split even timing very well with Acadian for both of them going in at the same time finding critical target comes through in this still looks to me like the makings of TSM be able to go topside a lot to be the same as round Jackson is Dillion but we've seen listen to run the top layer acts like it as well but once again go topsidefind broken plate a good match for any other powerful top laners and they can still go to the same kind of game plan with a clear and I do really like recti for topside domination Rex I can go over the back of that large wall behind the top laner come from behind your own trick even also can dive with the ultimate with your level 6 you can drop our a grow more options with hard for seeing if you are telling your enemies that you're going to Camp topside at least you have more options to hard forced it and I solo options for out playing there if they decide to once again to exchange size of the Mask as well kind of learning in the previous game the Kindred from Rush the virus in Apollo and the eight boxes solo is he still do not see the Xbox stop playing pictures yet to get one final bandsaving account to pay for Broken Blade super well with the damage output and can handle that lane quite effectively Xbox One to bring out for the wrong Top Lane tier that's interesting though we haven't seen her picture yet she is dropped off the tables like a fox a cat has played her a fair bit bladimir has been a good pick for so that was that was left on the table on the top side that says they have Corky and deadlines already going to have to rain damage dealers on your team with do see that they're bringing to the fight so it's pigeonholes solo into playing something on the top that a map that will bring some sort of structure do the dean's bite force of this game is going to be topside focused road going to come through basically invisible to Vladimir that silence Theory good againstdo you want us to kill but it does Bill your role of your tank email a champion that brings DC to the team's though also fulfilled the team wide aspect there definitely can't get over ex Eye Blind Manziel has yeah juggle Tower at a very effectively all right back line power or Apollo here and talk about the rain daily damage these are two of the best in roll and this is part of a box that for now it's 5 game winning streak at the end of the Spring Fling he was Vince games on a follow-up he popped off in the end games Phoenix a very good Corky as well we're seeing cleanse have it on both went to survive the back by an accident but the attempt to go topside or Flop I was talking about in game number one Champion Select been going to one of his other most played Champions the callista she's dominated with origin and which combination with galio the CDC is insane be able to save galio galio is going for initiation throughout the team fights or female to put Galileo in even in the tube on bottom side do you have to be to come it kills coming through the galio usually taking the ignite are completely changes the bottom my last time the bottom Lane we're both teams were farming out an echo box that is very good flushed taking the early turn around there's a lot more fight this one it's another game though it looks like 3 teleport still one where that bull run map Mobility could be a big deal for TSM all their major grade rats have it Acadia now on the wrecked side should be a very good early jungler to go to shake hands sixes first split with Tia Sammy's made playoffs. 3rd speed open to do good work here and Tackle Box Bell and those three core members of annuity did last year and take down PSN the quarterfinals nopales and they remember I'm quite sure that they do and they've got something to say about it here wake me up DFW the players already pretty good but will see into this series we go 1-0 Echo Fox and see if you didn't answer back before 2 we are on our way up for game 2 and I think that's a really a flying even just in this game because echo-fox do have a lot of power that they can bring towards the late game if drinks and Corky can get multipliers going that is a tremendous damage output with cho'gath one of the highest health scaling champions in the game on the front side and Rush the option to go either Warrior or full tank cinderhulk Darvin I think with this setup I would opt for the center hole full tank because you have again plenty of damage for team fights later on yeah and I also see that you have a couple of tanks already and don't need to be hard Freightliner but I agree that just simply taken for quirky things could have been seen by so let's see what it comes down to Ben's how the game goes by conkarah Jarvan I feel like it's not the most common maybe I'm out of touch a Different Drum goes I still don't think as taking over the most common room usage but it does also to me signal another option for building full tank because you have longer to get off and Prok your conqueror product thinking Rush may be going that way however if you want to get that where you want to get some really kills on Direct I told her that way if it's the way that you will and will have forgotten Warrior is better Duolingo the cooldown reduction is also really under-estimated part of the early Warrior Powers by which an option but I think especially with the Conqueror and might want to go for a little bit more longevity and I both been dropping 1 cm in the first wave of the Kaden to take down these chickens that much of an issue could have gone for a lucky few over the wall but they have been a blind Gaston doesn't happen there is a trace of your son X-Men a little too and we'll see if any more pressure happened last game Phoenix I was actually win they know Jarvis is a very common level two baking champion and the big different this time around there playing the callista galio much more aggressive Lanes they want to be able to push up so they do but the word down here they're still around to see Rush Enterprise rushes in the full version of everything right now we know Rex I did read to Rafters but Rush going to go to the blue buff Steven that should be pretty safe moving around to get some could have come around if they wanted to with their bottom Lane but with the kitties polygon that word trading sides of the map like this can be very detrimental if your soulmate's are both losing and getting pushed in because you can't get collapse fun soccer BK Ciara's both junglers are going to be on her act for the moment and it should be what people referred to as vertical jungling way just do the enemy Blues. Right after your red instead of going to your own and of course you going to the school later pretty good down here against our side close to Galliano play safe against the Jinx you could be around is unspotted could turn on any kind of gang who's out there we go is summer camps were taken away by the wrecks I as akkadian has I don't believe taking the full can't get I'm not certain that's very similar chemically being done by both these teams responding of jungle camps they do come back with more experience do you want to delay it as long as possible small wolf not worth too much of course Richmond take his fullkrug Camp as an RX by and I can't even have a chance to do the same here and guess she get all of the golden X beat that will be a small military leave for the next five Alexis Rush Camp Sargon doesn't cover the top link into the flag of a wallpaper store your board to watch that in the brush so no pressure top by the movie The Farm off small lead to bladimir but not gigantic an erection with the last vestiges manifold Claus away can you be back to Lane he's going to be able to refill pretty easily after that there wasn't really much of an investment for rush for going for that even though I didn't have a huge chance of burning a Summoner he's passing back down to the bottom of that anyway because he is Raptors and frogs are available if so you don't really give much away considering there's not many other spots that you can be so it's not even a big information change and is Phoenix box back to Lane 14 and 1/2 tbsp to take the long way back in Russia's to get back just to get the XP and gold and timetable starting I just picked up so you can have money to spend on their is the invade comes in as far as Wing spots rush I believe you can stop there a couple of? Things going down for a possible movement as they're able to deduce that only corner of the map that he being right now little room there from Dierks it's trying to help control this Vision around the bottom side as well since just want to have aggression with CD coolest The Galley arrested actually going to go in and get spotted by the controller can't finish it off he goes Which Way by occasional for little five if you wait too long a flag and drag you can on react to get the Nock point right now closer and enter the game lost now is like a fox and a do some different back in the midst by a lot playbuzz.com for Phoenix with those items feel pretty good about that fight yeah and Phoenix also has an extra charge and is corrupting potion to Shug right now they see Rush completely not only did they have the Deep War but aliens around here on rek'sai with pack of things going down hey so much closer than this time TSN the lead you going to follow her over the wall look for Rush. It was a close one and even still a little behind Rush idling take that fight all right lot of attention here around the mid lane control words for TSM are paying off Phoenix little bit of damage to take down Phoenix in Amarillo can you get that kill right off the bat the cloth for the sun Sons. Enough yeah they are tracking summer is here goes for the W in to Glen immediately answer they are from Acadian good. To stun him with a knock-up outside of Power Rangers are so they don't drop extra help because it could have been a Garmin collapse they knew that driving was on the bottom side if you take too long or you take too much damage from the trip there can be repercussions for that so I buy Phoenix not immediately flashing and Aura cleansing and then plastic afterwards if they are able to knock them up just outside of Power Ranger that finished off the kill without too much danger to themselves in a danger I'm going to the bottom Lane right now has more take him to come through vs or definitely pass like for Apollo boots plus the extra weapon Sears vent can definitely start to engage level six. Coming very very soon they're both about five and a quarter down during the bottom line stock market be too long away from those hard engages and we know we can easily have one rolled back by the time we get back to the galley and Alyssa so that bottle and I said absolutely happen you're going to follow in Aqaba for people who don't play like a list of the fruits definitely feel super good for your passive and laying upgrade as well as the same down there let's see if the controller also in the back of his wagon fit but you can tell they're very worried about this midlane jungle combo Lesage direct I already capitalizing for a kill and PSM a really switching objectives this time around they left Broken Blade on himself on the top side of the map and Acadian is focusing down around the dragon reschedule it taken with those little stick smoothie can feel completely screen of Sven killed
and it was night and day Acadian manhandled that Matt Davian one of the new guys on the squad definitely performing well and its first playoff really a bandsaw Dona Ana bladder a kindred tsmc to do well to Kindred band so might just keep seeing the same bands time moves on rekordbox might find something new but the difficulty is TSM keeps playing different things you got to figure out what it is the rock be afraid of hereall right what combinations are we looking through there are some other options as well making adjustments from last name to this game that echo-fox could make having different answers people talking about Swain being one of the big answer to listen to at least being have so much more Effectiveness and something like the Corky and I was a lot more a lot more crowd control for the TV have more options for set up and that can also work better with a jongleur early on the same throughout the whole Theory season 1 by Banning its role and there's the same as games do they don't want to have to see any thought of early game control you want to be able to take the matchup be super confident that it's not going to be thisearly guys going to start out here brush once again back to the Darvon is the same from TSM talked about this and they have different opinions from the saying driver is not viable against the Thunder playing to safely in the early game you're not going to get what you need and high and Cole were saying that well as long as you don't find those plays after the resident Fox lineup does Caleb more than something like a wreck by Jarvan brings attack speed the entire team a very effective early on can build tank tank initiation for the team so there are a lot of options one of the big things about the popularity of the champion is its versatility University Lodi echo-fox back on the age Rock strain the top of the previous game theory I would say good game on a truck over there and not one so they will come for and can be a strong leader of 4th Ave at 8 it's in a lot of Matt just put it intoheads up because the train now works for singing can get the damage off with their three Taco bron James and Cassandra back on the table for there it is they get the credit for the bands coming through that's what I got box well of the deck and let's do a recap yhec Roman even before the changes recently was a good match up in 2 HRS with the extra speed you can take it. You can go for the all-in now you also get more damage by stacking up your cues in Maine as a solo laner he gets a lot more levels early on so you can be much more of a Bruiser you don't have to be a rocket like you from the jungle and we are expecting this to be Top Lane but I meant in trouble because it can still be flexed again because it's less popular to be a jungler but certainly a possibilitycrazy coming out and it's even crazier that makes sense if you fight present as well we saw objects really explode on Alessandra able to follow Acadia around I'm just from having the kind of game he did in the previous looks like they are also looking towards the bottom Lane like everybody else that Calista last time around so much different 40s dance in different Lookout turn off the Nocturne they don't know looking at possible snowballing Lanes ahead with a crown plus dr. Lesage regalio dive is like the most insane.against this coffee tastes like throw your stuff out from long range and not be dope why so hard or should I put the ultimate and bomb on Monday to leave you with one of the guys using the L of blades early on Todd Dulaney get your harassment out strong leading pattern especially one hell of a way to work well with Ravi Bronx done very quickly King Lane I do like this round out here and that you called earlier as we're loading it to the game but this plane is another very common answer into lissandra super effective more tank he has a lot of these other options of setting up junglers sustaining through the engagesopen find a plan to lasondra cuz you so popular and SilverStar now but you can also do the long-range damage spell cause route Phoenix to me is much more of the law that comes from the timing on activating his taxes and his choices there with moving people around have been very good in earning that's dumb you know victories in Spring and I do like the Colossus lineup as a response to a very obvious least I've had two composite we expect the stopwatch to come through, at some point in staying this encounter and lysandra in Gallia that wreaked havoc over in that has not been disrupted even better for them with Hector into aatrox was DSM could still have a Slaughter of an early-game the coaches shake hands with one looks like here either way it one team is heading to match point that I see reason the best ofand it's now how well do you play Russia the great game one for most of it and a very weak game to be the cemetery listing in game one was almost invisible and seconded promoting better. TSM poised to make some I promise you expected it based on the regular season the higher-seeded matchup it's been a close fight on we go to send the wrif 101 alright pivotal game 3 who's going to turn the tide in this theory is often times the best advised we think so much momentum go with Fifth Third game pick up Ian pulling ahead 2-1 alright from on the table here for Echo fox go again every time I see it we mentioned possibilities going for more creative level one that's pushing to see more creative level ones are going for aggressive invades when you do have Champions like this to try and utilize it especially the best of fires and carve out some sort of early Advantage but it looks like and it might actually do it the lady has a possibility here is Spotify Ward though very defensive level 1 of course the instant drink at Ward you know Acadian can watch the other ways around knows where they're headed to just slink away from Martha. Much issue doesn't see if it would go down instead Place one of these I was actually not single brush over by the Raptors and Edith are high-value ghost poro they're right behind the Red Bluff in Wild bottom side smoothie try to sneak in there for a little counter invade to see if you could sneak some Vision a little bit deeper not going to be the case you mentioned Caleb lives, that is indeed to pick up there so the early aggressive Landon can be strong yeah I really am we have enjoyed it quite a lot of people have the ID in the back of their heads of the cognitive old where you have to scale up for super Lake in and you have to have a Lulu and again this Juggernaut actually just such a very effective Champion early on in the lake bed specially with this room taken so we'll see how much difference is bottom line makes last time around ya the Galileo Was the Same Book Calista is such a big part of your clothes and needling that and going aggressive I expect you to be favoured here I expect them to do better and we saw and a blunt it took like three plates before those fellows just in the spread out if you want to so that could be happening this though is off activation for top when Broken Blade should be handling winning this matchup over again solo charge up conqueror very very easily you can push the wave got us on Route 1 Summoner down very important for this bottom line with y'all in Ausable expensive Summoners exhaust is not the yellow or ignite of course they can come by when you're looking at a lot of like this doesn't make a lot of sense yeah because you have so much utility out of it later on does me maybe they'll be less options for those kills here I want to go to Vertical jungling that was Acadian takes his topside top half of his jungle and then comes in for the Scuttle the blue buff the drive in a rush doing a very similar thing and actually a new look now for early recall matches on Jungle not doing it either yeah and again when you're talking about opting into splitting the jungle find the Kellogg and this time around and he's able to finish it off first Blood Money freak that is terrifying that is absolutely terrifying but yet again they just had the damage yeah alright so Phoenix glasses away but wants to get a punishment off for them trying to yank and so he walks back up to deal some damage in the trade while Acadia is still here we're going to disrespect me like that you going to make you pay for it flashes head they get the kill he's rolling with the extra long sword on top of the blue Smite already and he said up once again to rule the jungle you really is a such a solid start brand blue Smita Fairlawn Court in more stops than Rush is going to look really solid and I find a lot from mid laner they get angry when they're gay trying to get out a little bit of damage after the tail end of it does pay off but the stepping up like that both of them self to the second flash that's a nice image of police car well this one is going to stay here and rest I should be able to continue the invade Russia knows he's got no mid later in addition to the side by the way the big chicken is it worth in a bunch of small ones as well this is getting out of hand rapidly it's getting faster and faster and see if his favor rust and barely able to do some minions out and replay but with the teleport timing here I'm assuming Phoenix teleported to a Minion out in the wave may be yet but I'm okay so he went he was just walking around and I just can't really good job there by Katie and immediately returning to the scene of the crime punishments of Blacklist mid laner hear no xtra-vision for Phoenix no extra pressure around there. There's no play it feels good to get those we definitely take those but I said I was going to bring up for Phoenix was that he was Frozen released warding mid laners in all of the LCS for all of us yes he has been great and Lane yes he has been such a force for echo-fox winning a lot of their games especially like snowy play it was very aggressively though and has a fairly low warding numbers with can come back to bite you sent me when you've just blown both of your stomach so far paying off pretty well and we look at the other lanes those small Advantage the echo Fox do well somebody's picture based on Match app and that really heal forced out for some defensive play earlier play out of broken play button up so that's coming or Advantage back and turn around the next time don't listen for his right there about stop a big is going to get found out there's a control it behind their Red Bluff as well still giving him entering the river now but they're trying out for Acadian more stuff that have black this could be nice. They're by Phoenix. Fertile Drake picked up bottom when pushing for them Apollo Dhaka love so stable for this teeth yet again findings to pressure here really like that talk about pick in the second half pays off fourth of the El campin Tanaka plenty of Damage Done to his fill of Brooke inflatable just trade that back and forth solo wants to revive he's not going to get too so keep my throat feel so low on B12 got to see that one time and he just goes for it right under the turret immediately takes down solo is rewarded for his till he walked back right there to try and Dodge out of wrong with you but I will still able to hold on still landed and the collapse from echo-fox able to take over control of this River that is pretty late for them over broken plate Lincare flavor series real
game 3 of groups be here TSM versus Genji is the battle TSM all they have left to do is Place spoiler for try to finish up in third which may still be possible based on the results so far at least tying lgd at that point Genji are fighting for of course a spot in the quarterfinals There are 16 in 1/3 mostly if they lose out and permutations into the top off a Fitbit BTS they are at work in a tiebreaker and this was hoping for a courses at least talk to me but they would love to top it with that date with fanatical later on in the day looking to get some of that take off their face hoping to get themselves to wins overall to close out their world run exactly DSM right now playing for honor and I don't evenneed any differences in Champion Select from them I'm looking for Corrections on the field in the play from the player more proactive that Killer Instinct don't let the opponent Run the game let's take a look here the final Bandit from Genji is the Camille taken away from the hand of Broken Blade guy it will be a different when ignition 10:40 to get Lucian picked up here certainly a highly of world band wrote in the group stages band that played for time has not lost yet very powerful right now in the solo Lane PSM at them selves use this in North America in the LCS playoffs it was a big pick up for them consistently bad after they found their victories where it's a high-pressure Lane Broken Blade was able to successfully use it they can flight disappeared soon as well so really like the furpick up your core TSM and I wonder what gender you are thinking as far as there are cancer is going to be and with an orange we are going out scale dsm's early aggression we don't think that they are going to bring it to us as they saw earlier in the day and and they think that they can just get to those extra or nice Santa can stack up our souls and play through that way and I'm looking to find some Magic Image Neville not going to go for a little league instead of crowd control speak of their on the Lilia Garcia said she has the most pollution came from the split of course you can double as one on the split so far and now it's time for the third pick we know what's going on the other side you've got the Santa coming down there has there been Flex as a real support pick it's always been really taking it as a farmer down there were no orangeBarracuda be the answer honestly thinks that I support kind of sucks I'm definitely not a big fan so I'm hoping that they do put it in his hands and they draft the grave so looking for a high damage control Maids highly probable there for bdd that's probably what she has Dan waktu Focus their Vans out mean while looking across at the volibear Lucian solo lanes and I'm trying to figure out what they're going to do about support take away some of the engage opportunities again a big part of if you are trying to go for a better feeling composition is taking away long-range and Gates and crowd control support from your opponent so that they can't force it on you girly you don't get to put the extra pressure on your lanes and on your dragons acting right now most likely Bjergsen pick on this Lucien that's where everyone else puts the champion but we'll have to see it is flexiblewild Bronco II support band a good answer to when you put up the shields you break or insulting make that can't pretty weak overall to kill him in a long field team fight without the crowd control protection ban about sign up for the team fights over all vinyl banner also be aimed at midlane probably another allow any sort of room around there from life let's see what the early one they can actually stayed vdd Pick 4 for guaranteed counterpick for themselves they already are you a pic right now I think Oriana is deer both decent options dilution is going to have pressure in to you regardless because you know you do need that AP damage for your team givenset up that you have right now so just go for it and and play the little bit defensive early on hell yeah I was so it's going to be much more around box side they played four games more or less of trying to have Broken Blade carry and that had not turned to anything so it's now the Bjergsen NW show late game team fighting on the other and everyone else is there to support initiative a little weak thresh hook isn't amazing amazing swirl speed is mediocre we get time to make the pot little bit safer Odyssey 70k going to have no problems in the early to onto you don't have any real feel pressure bear will see now if the or inorganic you fighting for Genji individual cheer for TSM Lucian and threats have been some of the most banned champion at the entire tournament biofrost there's a big magnifying glass on him for creating plays for this team or findwork with because Lily at for these trying to get some pants taken away from control there and we shall see TSM get on the board fighting for Honor here in the group but also could be a big spoiler to Genji Genji hopes are high for a 1st seed coming off that previous Victory Britain's LTD the only way by date at least by breaker for getting out of group the only way they can be dropped to just straight-up third is if TSM win this game there have to be more going on of course not the only scenario but that would be TSM allowing an lck team to fall out in groups will see that come through here again TSM really only fighting for Honor they can do at best a tie for third if lgd drop all their games and it's a little bit of Saving Face but they can never make quarterfinals with the 0 and 4 record just the way the groups of shaken out so far Genji though looking for Dolla Sign of early pressure topside at speaker fightPorsche of the Jungle will do so and I've been knocked down the Lord to get the goalie of the icky but now the most 3 on 3 in from Lilia with your cue length of these things to get all your health bar back entirely and it is another trend of LCS teams with a good level one putting out a really good start the game off of Full Camp Clik just now starting on this is the signs of life that LCS Bans are looking for from TSM you know some to practice flight starting to get off on the right foot this does section 2 map so vile Quest and double it will have to be cognizant it has to be bottom side of the map be careful with your trading be careful with pushing for early level to be DD getting chased down into the river by clit is healing to go for the rain gauge with ghostthe Summoner have to go for the blacks falling not going to get anymore and it's to flatten for Gen Z Plus the coast for the black speaker again this is TSM, losing 74. Play as a hail of blades time can sure know it's not the hell is lights on Kent you still got it because of the mid play that where they chased out speak up it is to be clipped doing this away while speaker can come find him there's no Smite for speaker so quit should be able to get it regardless giving up the fight at least watch this might take for the eclipse is on the chase he's got the first blood coming through for bjork's in the kind of game and a fast one of the sea but now.could be good in a battle DVD to flash listen to Power shots but this is also double bumps on mid lane at Lucien piercing getting that kill is huge also with a one-v-one on his Lane opponent because BTD did not have either Summoner spell from the last time they chased him down he is very good signs are for TSM speaker going to be able to get the crab afterwards replenishing his men a critically as it goes for the second Raptor Steel 2 minutes is the response pollark amps is going to get scouted out here but shouldn't be too dangerous for him at the outside of an overall he knows you for the big chicken and honestly I got those thingsLilia is so good at playing for Raptors because you get some like three help for second region on everything packed with a spell and their split 7-6 pieces that can see you're like Out regening Auto V PS4 money for Living in scenario you are always safe taking that camping yeah no problem I'll speak to watch right now for anybody that can apply towels Target Evelyn as well all these early level junglers I do once you went to flop a level one in bed to keep up the timer on the Raptors 2 minutes is is really easy for a return since Raptors are centered at the the mid lane it's really easy to make your jungle path very flexible around that area especially since you have a lesionright now it's still a close game 400 gold difference is going to keep it close to Smite goes through clip gets bottom Scuttle at Sea could finish crugs going to fight over this Ward and Drake could well be attacked but it was leased by pick a fight lose them how to plant turned out not going to mean too much overall we stay at the four hundred gold difference stop playing small farm lead to the full of are you kind of suck to one lane again store in similarly on and then so far so good for Broken Blade again it means more to look at the bottom side of the map early recall came through for doubles for a cold very similar here for ruler on the Santa so far lately for Genji's do and don'ts Douglas have not been seen in quite a while so you can see that hesitation here BTD slowly moving up doesn't want to expose himself too much to the Lilia is ghost is now come back off cool down so that plus call include over my does give him the copy Sports indecent damage couldn't place up there with y'all T Still Still takes a lot of damage back from Torrid shots Broken Blade I need to look for fresh or he's going to bring it is here as well as to what's going on level be for speakers and they get the root end of the turrets o life going to lose what's a great help you when you got any of that about two-thirds walk away from that play top link control spoken to go to you since Lakeland cannot fight for control word of mouth will regen and I'll come pick you up off of these rugs and put cannot face check it'll be another Camp stolen away is fika dies with a crusty Laswell going to be even further head Blitz step into his own holding a lot of these Lanes clit at half this is a kind of her forward to the YMCA to TS them and we only get in game 5 Jungle Theory early on in the first game where the rise of these power clear is is greatly accelerated by strong lanes for yourself during that entire scenario where you're talkin Lucian gertsen was moving up into the jungle to self there is no possible answer from Genji TSM playing around their jungler trying to lift speaker up but life as well now has got to reset and round out support to have something to say about it blows now fighting for the Red Bluff is it dangerous to level 6 with Mike was down so you can get any more done but still 49 in the jungle right now and still momentarily a two-level lead 10.1 thing out about these total recall seeing a lot of 80 carries it's great on pick up Champions like ruler set up because that's the recall he wants doublelift cannot afford BF sword I don't know BF store timing and I think it's a smaller piece I'm not a huge fan of vehicle recall on Via all right just give a little bit of time there for the room to we saw very impactful move from Life by marrying a little bit but no extra Visions play behind in the in the jungle there so after the reset they're still going to have to try and come test towards the river and right now ruler and life with the slow push accruing here on these minion he's not trying to put the very quickly he's building it up weight extra pressure and control board can come down last fall as done topside Roscoe's opiates not going to come through and DSM find a third kill the game 600lt a champion it is all in broken blades control this or he could have come right over say don't go for a freeze on it bottom side though under harassment we talked about that big meeting with that was slowly building up for ruler and life and they're trying to punish double it under power making Miss some of the Tea Act find the root and soul taken away from Douglas now quit taking away frogs sorry and maybe for the pipe here as well starting to walk that was out to get them Duo healers use bright flash Lantern separation between a safety hazard can play Right Thurr speaker do off the front of a Flash and he'll get stopped side Scuttle and can look to get even more done if they ripped Harold gets another Raptor can't steal 21 CSD now in the jungle was the biggest we have seen yet to level one and only relevant but he kept the pressure up thoughtful Under Fire 2 to replace already taken its at CSM so far in the back foot heater in the wind condition
they've been willing to invest and erectile pick over and over again lyrics in on lissandra over and over again. So early game Equifax need to change the course of this series irelia Raisa Kali and yet Broken Blade steel found pics like an acronym to do well on so now it's the support pick up smoothie the galio is gone next what else will it be the wrecks I will it be something else to push TSM a little bit of comfort the weights are listed here just go completely at what has been beating you actually still throw a cannon van up hereI would expect something like that feels like a setup here definitely is a possibility and they're going to be dropping that band themselves will TSM pick it up they continue to go with the Kindred band and they moved it up though they are adding normally play tenant has to be a ton of acclivity SM what is it they're going to go for here in TSM do they keep the Morgana band if kept throughout this entire Siri that's talking about the black prince Phoenix or I feel like a hot go specifically is so strong right now he is put a lot of time in over his career on this Champion if you all the time have to handle a favor it was a bunch of bindings akali top of match but I calmly first pick of course that can be flexible still in Phoenix both believe it off the band was grabbed it right away all right right off the bat ecopoxy as long as the gauntlet Macaulay first picks definitely a champion that you can Style on definitely a champion that in playoff the most high pressure moment can have the biggest of plays alrex eye doesn't get change the threat still there yeah the Champions around the big matchup are going to be around and Lucien comes in as well I'd really be like Lucien into a collie over all the Earth can hit through the Twilight shroud is pasta visual on the Champions and kind of land the entire Opeth even though she is obscured that can be really positive thing here Lucian also build semi Tanki for most people a little bit of extra Health full coverage there but no hesitation Apollo and Jaco coming in lovers Duo they played together for the majority of their careers over 3 years now they're going to be able to have some Synergy coming in with some speed biggest thing here on 9.6 she got extra attacks be coming through very big buck for xayah rakan has always rely so heavily on the speed of your engagement I was going to try to disrupt that on reflect you can head Butler Conaway long as you start this value by the push him away even if the prom does land on you who is Alfred can be very aggressive we can a T-Rex I can't come down but I still look at them a few of his favorite anime outscale I think it's overall shape is there slightly stronger before I can like get the pox look at this. You kind of come back and win two straight there is a rise band but he isn't tell us things to get rid of a call he's going to one of those still looking have even more a collie pics right now like a colleague matchups that you would even want with because of the Shroud like there's so many defensive way you can play the lane that even even matchup that can have an advantage becomes like pretty hard to really deny that champion LeBlanc has definitely been one as well irelia that spent on the band is still available one last band are left for Echo Fox vs I'm getting rid of an auction themselves worried about how good not forget that playing alongside of us are enjoying the break of the TV one kill doors that is a play style if you with a Collie make sense there and there's a really also dropped off as a would-be counterpick looks like it's just several toppling Vance put through by echo-fox that Kenan at the very beginning and really a gangplank of Houston didn't grab they wanted the Alice through all of it I'm not sure what we don't know for sure where it's going freckled Fox LeBlanc no it doesn't Zoe okay's do guinea crap we notice Pearson and now, we want to play a colleague into Zoe's or we putting a call again blind after I've and I feel like there's always going top for solo here we'll have to wait and see for the final lock in the show tsf TSM very correctly keeping their v v once again for Broken Blade then you're going to play Darling I'll wait a little bit longer to decide what midlantic going to play a part of what got echo-fox in the playoff was for straight Darvin game for Russian and he played it really well at this time around bottling should definitely have pressure I love that 212 you should be able to do that has pushed pressure as well you should be able to have a decent game here spindra maybe the lock in that can be solid have a lot of good Laimbeer garbage to be comfortable getting around the map yeah I do I do really like to send her into Zoe there whenever so we always try online if you're done here to call your jungle you go for all in pretty frequently on the Zoe Summoner spell Phoenix take the timer add extra defensive capabilities dealing with the trouble Bubble at 1 go spend the helicopter around the Shroud Splash damage going to tear that would work pretty well and then they swap back around Brooklet probably keeps the ignite will have to see you sound have a very aggressive team they can definitely get in Zoey Lucien can follow up. He have a lot of very good Lane that'll take at least favorite of the one on one But as time goes on that ship has been a lot of damage this is going to be so cheap here too because we're looking at Sindra and Daya being engaged upon by Alistar flashtrek side ekrem dive same thing for Zoe there in the backline Pearson have to be very careful cognizant of his position a record speed cannot be underestimated give me the final handshake of Houston for the split do or die for echo-fox they must win to straight to knock down TSN and make it up to the semifinals where Team Liquid or Cloud Nine oh wait and solo has done it before last spring it only got one more chance left now back to get the walls they have to win now Mega Man the crowd favorites is 2013 an even earlier for the first time ever TSM Miss finals in both splits of 2018 they are hoping to not repeat those mistakes here back in Springdale Austin quarterfinals do those players still Apollo and hot coil this time around 2 and one up they can easily make this series there's very quick Paws so asks pill? So we got a monitor issue for Buicks in resolving right now okay should be getting right back into it they have unpause so we are back in release and he will be the last one of the spirit SMS to my finals Echo Fox toe finger we are all in the wrist they have such a tall task ahead of them TSM seen as many by many players and fan as the strongest team coming into playoffs definitely the strongest team in the second half of the split a proven it with all of their victories 11 and 1 since week 3 I miss Siri still a pretty solid scoreline in with current form of the players look like they might close it out Echo Fox though they were counted out and then we're back in week 7 week 8 we started talking about which could make the question Fox wasn't even a team we mentioned their outside looking in with TLC 9 to play but it beat them both before and go run and they were going to Giant Killers but he is and maybe a little too big for them are they still hold us two in one leading the series then rushed waiting around of the Wings they are about to get one aggressive word to help try to track for the rest I might go in it and Kayden indeed is that is on Red Bluff that wore didn't provide too much value especially considering I put it down so he will know that there is one behind here that's why they're discontinuing with the Blue Bloods still here that Ward is it to see Acadian later on and it's past it is to make sure that he's not going to pop over on the blast Khan what is anything that's three games in a row and this one especially at the Box off thing into the vertical jungling we know right size for sure going to go Raptors to that chicken than in and take down that left side jungle so first game they opted into it and it worked out because solo had very good one V2 play on the top side playing on the weak side and it allowed Echo box to control the dragons of control the bottom side and get their Victory but ever since then broken plate has had better matchups Broken Blade has had more pressure and Kayden is a Trek size of champion that can go for Tower dies even if you are playing safely once you get access to level six over the back of this wall here with very few Champions can do this and go right there to do right behind the tower and right now of the Wolves to go back with the priest Altima Spot Lane right now but it has yet to take any of that jungle where is Russia's post that entire right hand side working late is pushing up to in the lane so you should have confidence of his top laner meanwhile bottom side exact same thing echo-fox know their Duo Lane they've got run of the Jungle here on the bottom side so they won't be inhibited going to get over here and you're pointing out y'all getting didn't get a lot of the early counter cycling's done so Rush is going to catch him red-handed Lancers might take the fire Lee grabs it but keep in mind the rest of camp and work till in a wait there was more form available so that was slick gets away from the pulverized if you make it sound like it was a great press release the jungle cast as well yes so this jungle Advantage does come to fruition if we have now a reverse clear from Russia and that is topside down he finished up meanwhile Acadian the only left the like what he's doing right now though because the only option for erectile when you have no count cat sound like that gang and his mid laner Phoenix is the prime gank Target so Rush instead of going to immediately clear that helps Phoenix push out the midways doesn't have any words but the game has a wart and it's Steve's rush now return to the Raptors my phone up for like one more second so taken back by Acadian pies up a little bit more but still right shoulder ahead and Rush up two camps worth of Cs and tops cuddles up right now for going to have the advantage are Russians not had a recall off and he has very little Mana do upgraded my so I can't even the only problem is mid laners just recalled Mike gets its cut over to a mid laner power and that's a big man eats your first Acadian they cannot contest York City's back in basement for the recall Phoenix is here so they collapsed echo-fox secure the Scuttle crab and Rush year does have the expanse advantage over Acadian for this game and they're mentioning as well you know the manner that you get back after spending the Scuttle crab in addition to the health very big in allowing the possibility of turning that fight around definitely important right here First Tee pees used topside Broken Blade going towards the cowl a finished extech revolver in for Solo in that matchup actually feel 40 equal in the ass so that's going better than the blind a truck payment on the blind a call into an all-right bot Lane Advantage TSM Wellfleet them despite the fact that Jarvis be able to spend more time bought by the way to get more farm land the bubble is Bjergsen but also up in form Pennsy it's really 5 to farm guess I'm doing pretty well jungle mattress advantage to Fox but not the length have your sim definitely has been extremely good over the series on Alessandro games very different Champion here and still wait for him there looking for those bubbles ocean ocean actually slips into the back of the word inside so he's been cleared out instead you really can not start up an ocean break this early in the game without knowing that the enemy will not come find you there it does too much damage it slows you will be caught red-handed you'll be killed and then the enemy gets to take it away so he should instead and then leave it at that for supplies and Jack backed away bacilli two-and-a-half Camp Elite overall on the echo
Stihl D needs to be so good at identifying what I could possibly enjoy the power straight at the Champion Select no time to be wasted we've already seen the first couple bands at the band table we'll see if that carbon is to follow soon as we toss it out to the casters for the call thank you very much. In the last spot in the playoff one's going and I have a little bit of inside intelligent for the analyst test all about what will happen if diamond is band I went to register him last night and I made a personal request to please play ap Pravana on page cuz I've been saving it and it's really fun he said no chance at that but he has also been practicing his in Italy okay which previously has played on the LCI stage so there may be a small chance of a pee at jungle Powerhouse a very bad so far thisBattle of fondor so long because across champions league and out by CLG hoping to play some more off metal stuff on both sides all right I also like this Calista echo-fox previously yesterday we saw sdlg have sticks they bring out his Calista once again and he did not die completely different blades Kalisto with bow Frost Brom was definitely a force to be reckoned with and both of these teams did something different with their bottom lights on the echobox died they had a hell of a cock my backed up by a Lulu's that's the bottom line Focus could be incredibly important as well rek'sai the first pick of the day here in again this right here means vs7 a huge deal here and thought and hands of Wiggly is what gives you to place their trust in meanwhile Apollo the back on the Jinx a big champ for him with Rush on Sedgwick Countyyou Show Jinx and said Lonnie early on Friday and you won't that is how you are playing the entire game so we'll see if they can group up and get their communication back on the line what are the things that has been the downfall of every box earlier on and it split were played where they were not on the same page because people running in different directions if you have a 5 on 5 team by you need five people there who is Lonnie stand in front of jinx get your rockets off and press are at somebody meanwhile you've got fresh and likely a kite that year but it's getting bottom side and I like Rushford I think more fits the bill of a heathen land that hook onto Jinx and go into the big tray to be powerful I expect an immediate answer home or Ghana or Tom kench to keep that thang alive Against The Rush. Going to play I do feel like it was a bit of pressure on the c o d bottom line they have to perform now they have to make something happen against the Jinx at least pollution getupscale so there is going to be an early Focus here when you have a rexite thresh Lucian as your first 3 pick the early game had some demand you need to execute you get the skills and actually destroy that champion really true the word of exeggcute give it comes in I'll be like Latimer here but also happens to handle a lot of popping match up pretty well equipment they also threatened back liners with a tox already banned out here not too many more really great matchup into the flat Amir you can go for a get more options early game and try to make something happen but just put a lot of pressure on you I forgot already snowing quite a bit upscaling every Lanes with some of them have to get out of jail without getting tank pressure so we will see what comes through band off the table wheels with a black can be flexible it's definitely a speeding ticket not your husband beforeI'll see if he's going to put down a cell for somebody with a stroller for his third game of the split what's going to be the middle Amy's LeBlanc band in from power of evil side and they're likely going to force the LG the blankets are mid laner and gives me to pick against the best player only a power house yesterday syndrome play vs galio was up early on in the game there's you choose damage output point of power for CLG to play that entire game around there in talking cuz Okay we listen to man it feels like let's go in for the last 2 matches we care about your what is that final band going to be if he legit gaming grounds now is in the second phase of pics Xbox me to support beta mid laner most likely the really is under the band table CLG need both solos combinable remain flexible. Until after pic with LeBlanc in Orillia bands here by CLG I do expect power vehicle to go with another kind of more long-range backline made our house to your schedule has been already bad out but things like the belko so can we just saw from Prague in are the type of champion I think they might go for how did band out to all in mid laners I have possibilities of killing someone like that and there's some kind of expect I could definitely a good morgan of player only a second so far in the split but I love it in the thrash I think it's very good overall in fight and he's an expert and after the recent bust you just stronger version of the same Champion that does more damage is better is better indeed so what does CLT pick now so we can I come in there be a long race champion can have some really severe Polk and he's not here overall pretty evasive I might have to run cleanse Adidas sambas Bell right now to has Lonnie but should be yeah that was the main thing I'm looking at it very easy for a surge Ronnie if so we ever ours to land the Feds Watching ultimate just throw it right at the graduation point that she uses going to be another split Busch beer I'm expecting the attack Nico for topside is so good I feel like this is such an underutilized assassin paper people to go for if you're facing double AP thread it can really really turn around again the one thing he loves killing Cassidy Cassidy and I really did like it was armor on the Champions so if you have attack damage threat you can really punish this Champion early echo-fox have gone all-in on scaling Lake in here but Zod are going to try and stop them from getting there a little work for them before a couple of Vladimir wins in the most recent weeks this could be another one here for Echo Fox on a three-game winning streak including beating me top two teams in North America kind of logic gaming speak in their way and it's going to be a spot battle for number 6 fight against TSM in the quarterfinal fealty would love to end that losing streak of over a thousand days against at Squaw but first they got to take them like a fox there is so much pressure on this game last playoff spot on the line in an early game composition with a timer here for CLC can they get it done early they're going to have to put them down early last playoff spot in Spring 2019 is a one-sided who gets to watch the game NFL Fox sort of Cheers we are out of the rift what else can we say but waiting for the fights begin looking at Wiggly's early pressure we know to be on hit for darshan with that press the attack I think he's kind of mage build viable to let me talk to him is not that it was A Rush of the ruined King added and just wanted to survive long do in his lie to me was always able to do so but not able to teamfight yeah I think there are so many options for CLG you know to execute with this dress is a great support as well to support that is a hook will there be a policy number one that's a really good point so quickly with the right amount of gold in the pool and Flash list against an already know my let's take another look they got into that price just in time as I did a swap really it really interesting defense there from Echo Fox as they left a hole in their own jungle CLG walk right in and get first blood and this is not the way the echo Fox wanted to start out it is going to be very scary in the early game of a quick-release over the rush there on the Blu Boston now spot the two on to find not going to Idaho Brian q auto auto auto damage they've got Wiggly around 6 a.m. is able to dodge that sidestepping very critical I mean there has been a lot of talk to you about this Tod bottom Lane in spring so far they're showing up they'll biofrost Landing to death sentence is early on in the game the first one was on to solo had no vision of him and his walking right into the brush but it was worth for in a golden change the first what a cyst and Wiggly is Flash list but predicting the jungle pathing year of rush I bleed my voice to know it but either way it was read to Bluetooth rugs or vice versa it was going to take away a lot of little chickens for that and they have a vision biggest thing that I like to see from Top winners that are looking to have advantageous Lanes like this when you push up get a Deep Jungle Ward on the enemy camp Casey rush they know he's over here on open the dialog hats backwards other side of the Jungle weekly now can clean up his entire jungle all of the small camps still available for you can keep the pressure up at Acworth again he's got that extra long sword in inventory from the first flood and actually damage to become a nice for him and I saw a power that was halfway up so they should have an idea that we could come for this almost to feel I was pretty lucky and I said separate then I rushed out to do battle can't get a small wolves no more XP stolen away and Wiggly. Grump and with the way it is but it gets it yeah that's a big drawback of going for full scale in here. She has control of the lane and sister junglers already ahead no-brainer go for the invade continue the pressure and make Rush pay the price you know some of the pressure is expected the degree to which sealed use a head is above and beyond normal no biofrost me to go to the flash of can you predict okay better than school and I could do anything to be just fine. Just walking up all you have to even do is walk out of range you got vision of them pretty early on there so good job there by Phoenix playing defensively on the cat that he knows he has no business stepping out there in the early game Rush who should get there at this exact time and really good vision control so far from darshan awarded the frogs he's able to get the time in here down on the tribe Russia's well avoid a possible stage 1 of gank Maven spotted one day going over there they even paying the sake of those fryers Bloom do they know that the 20th outside jungle jungle Camp all of them are gone all I can do is have slowly been on the map look something to do still want to come to go to the farm yesterday but when you are doing a very good job has a team counter juggling the enemies regular early on only option is going to be to make a lane play like that as long as you can away fresh going to have to go back as mid laner has no Mana for each Define meanwhile on the top side of darshan continuing to push in Solo who has used his teleports What vitamin is already had to use you know with that pool start and the first flight going over the Summoner spell that will get him the reset Rush on the cross back on the top side maybe we can provide some support but mostly going to be about still trying to stand under the tower easily inferred jungle path because the rappers are taking my Wiggly in it take a look at all those chickens Wiggly has to be respectful but they know that are trans Closer by and the route yeah 4Runner still only 17 vs individual gold even discounting the 400 lead for the first Blood it is a pretty big Advantage here on the one side we have clear ultimate here all right sometimes people freak out when I see stuff like this but our son is just going for temple we mention that he's already for the teleporter of solo he has his own available so you go being able to push Tampa is going to be big for sale G in continuing to leverage their early game Advantage there's a first play nice tears he is here we have some fans yeah those are better true plates both are definitely there they're just more versatile I greet you can put liquids in them all my God gave us two with the offensive play here Ripley's moving in consistently trying to clear out the wards as well as the jungle camps from the side of echo Fox this time can I have the back off its going in blind first Trevor sense there was Justice Edge Ronnie he was not tracking the rest of the echobox members he did not have a fresher from 6 a.m. biofrost to go for this yes he had a thrash behind him about Frost
Spurs playoffs however they can shake up their seeding if life was when they lock exactly for that they get spice collection in their quarter-final Golden Gardens if they win will tie flyquest hybrid Queen of the day we are the champions league game playing definitely have been a big trade you for Echo Fox and they have been focusing on that Lake in but I really do feel like people are not giving enough credit to frog in LeBlanc an assassin play as well I think it's been quite a good I think the main factor though it's contracts giving some early pressure to that lane has been a lot of success were golden Guardians meanwhile toppling for Viper has been a Hotpoint people advanceone of the most band Champions vs flyquest ribbon is also ties with play right now another meeting that way for quite a while at the contract early founding of being a big factor in Golden Gardens wind there have not been any Jungle Band so contract and get his pick of the litter right here we saw his Kindred yesterday but today is the game jungle are here not a big surprise for contracts wants to go super hard with the gangster Leon Rex eyes a perfect Camp you to do that scale that well as far as looking forward to late game but they also have locked in tandem here with a Tom catch one of the best before it's at pushing through the mid-game Abyssal Voyage to such a big pool for professional play Olay as soon as heyou can try and take another Lane you can try and go on with your jungler and we'll see if the Devourer becomes a very big part of their team fight as well they're going to be excited to see what kind of backed Runner comes to read still thinking fight comps for frog and definitely are the best of the day for Golden Guardian eprom coming in here for flat foot support how to counteract that Tom kendzia now it's going to be seeing that a Nocturne might indeed be another high Mobility camping around the map and honestly, I can what time Kent tells your story even with either team picking one of their they're toppling are yet for a possible split push fit getting Tools in preparation for the showdown between Oscar and Viper how did you mention Nocturne also very good at attacking and defending when the map is spread out very similar to Comcast has come through here for deftly I feel like you got your pixel it here bottomliners entirely in both ears to get bug pics to help my daughter are genetically stronger ones especially when Brom can block you and not sure exactly make your life difficult embarrassed requirement extremely good at getting back to Marksman that has no dash or just to get away. So there's definitely going to be difficult for him I would say that maybe he will go The lethality build and price spike really early on in the game and if that isn't a combination you do with a successful recti pass early on that it could be a lot of a pronoun for the really came here for a chance that there is Place Midland and if somehow a good taking the left and right I don't think it is but we seem verra said before so who knows I'm getting dropped off the table of course LeBlanc and reply Quest Facebook talking something aggressive to go out from Viper or pobelter top Light Up and Away in his life westside of Vladimir Lenin's dropped off and I think this is a good top laners possible here for the Golden Gardens already showing the various in recti lot of a d damage they're going to need some AP so that fly Quest won't pick up you know laugh tank or something they're having the itemization is but we know what Sonic and close that Gap and this is a huge backline source of damage for frogging in this could be golden Guardians looking for a Audi build for varus build super long-range different damage types of those things combined quite well I think I'm curious then if it's going to the core four of the fog what's that fifth ever going to be will it be coming in to join or is going to stay to the side light and heat Viper busy the first pick time Kent makes me think that it's going to be something of a 4-1 and it will be a split Champion solo has by Hunter off on the other side and then the poor rest of them threw up there with the mid pressure and Tom can't do kind of go-between veriscan with his extra range do some decent things are in the bottle and she will come through for her as well I believe you aatrox she comes through here I think either way home so comfortable in the one I want up there and keep the point of busy yeah it's not necessarily going to steal into a split butcher like we might have been thinking with a Tomcat spin doctoring floating around right minor I have to take one of the most annoying thing to deal with as Alessandra The Claw is very predictable you know exactly where lysandra is coming in and unless she instantly has black very easy for the land that silent and you can come combo that was quite well to the main tank for a team are still shots it's not guaranteed. Point-and-click so they might need to set up maybe a flash taco from rex or just good play and getting your are we still Trust first time of the year here for a frog and and show gas almost through the first of the year. Winter gear joins the squad has launching Nocturne for Santora's going to be in adult size as time goes on a quest in Golden Guardians doing battle throughout the day laughing locations are here at the end of the game started at the waist two playoff teams already qualified going at it early let's see what we can get here stopwatch on the side of santorin as well as froggen and JJ always count your stopwatches early on in the game and there was might be the sites of tower Dives all right so as they Square Off way to go in the playoffs if you need a way to wrap one of these teams heading to class make sure to check out the official jerseys on LCS merch.com you can be super fanned out for the postseason they will see you in St Louis and you'll be wearing pretty pretty colors and remember the changes that you mention in 9.5 for cho'gath or simply EZ damage increase on the vorpal spikes a little bit of extra flat damage so those Autos will be a little bit stronger helps out with a wave clear as well pretty meaningful by fax I think so that's a viable and good to see him back around now I've been waiting to see what kind of Tanks would show back up in the medicine show. One of the first ones to reappear but if you're a mage in fighter heavy up there it's funny you mention that cuz I have been talking to so many of the top players and teams as well and I've heard a lot about Malachi but we still haven't seen him picked Malachi and hack ROM and I got in a lot of starts out as I definitely but certainly a health leave there for black was it back a little bit there but that's going to be a nice little start to the Lane for wild turtle and JJ especially with the ROM Lucian that's going to go a long way Tom kench is the one that you want to Target pretty San Elijo top of your for definitely if you land the eagle the attack speed right afterwards and push first we'll still go to Golden Guardian style be slightly under the Blacklist her but there's room. If you need to call me simple clear in this mid-length clear for the early stages definitely do you have good that up on both sides by the way then trekked I can Flash in for an odd stuff followed up by Adele cardstock up it's the jungler sitting at the mid laner meanwhile the other side is the one that has to set up for Nocturne but she definitely has a very easy time of doing that so that's why you can see frog and has taken cleanse on the vel'koz as well if there is at initiation frontal Belfair he's got a couple ways out right now small dips for Hunter here in this Lane as many more minutes to kill and help our little bit low hasn't proposed yet but will have the same backup is life is bullying a little bit up here now one of the biggest things for cho'gath and kind of the break-even points for cho'gath lanes are can you believe them enough early to keep them off the minion way did you get so much distain through finishing off those minion rapper doing a pretty good job here of keeping Han Solo and a couple his minions have died as he's trying to Auto attack in the air is nice except it was an awful and it's worth and 60s you dropping out loud by not last hitting now Santorum and topside again I have felt oh God is a gay couple Champion specially of knocking behind him there's just enough Runway eyeglasses are ready yeah NACA pins weather for this week in Cabool it's for sure gangable I thought it was going to go on The Knockout but if they see him he all they needed in as a little bit of vision right now to know that he's still in this way must be careful okay rent in midlane person easy possible to make sense a but now it's been topside he is so far away there should not be but he's not walk to the world's longest possible but patience pays off for stand for in Camp there for the top laner Viper is able to get a lead in the lane and Stan torrents able to get to kill money on Nocturne which will fund the early Warrior enchantment for more cooldown reduction is damage behind your ultimate this is going to be huge doctor in the champion that can definitely snowball very effectively looking at these Lanes cho'gath No Escape frogging on the eval tattoos Summoners wordscapes as well as above so lanes are very very good Nocturne targets is half of these right about the all-in coming in so I chose a very risk-averse play but now one left photograph him that sun while and that will be a living there at the help why not quite low without a few to get back to Lane yeah I really like how you want to devour before the last Auto comes in so that damaged doesn't go off the practice and go off if you don't always want to wait for the sea sea to land and then take them out of the TC has denied them damage there while turn on JJ though still very solid hold on this bottomland pushing up and that means easy dragon control for stand for in the topside driving does go down to get that Global reach and you'll know that the Nocturne is there an app that you can see on the mini map is already headed up towards Viper black was aatrox and no Wards play it's going to be anything to get out of it they do get the flash but they know that they have lost the objective bottom sides does turn into a mouse in Draper flashlight pretty worthwhile I'll burn a flash for a drake you to Mountain one or Leon and I'll frog and look at this boat out they're not going to play Klaus up so there's no easy day going to find a q's plug in the comment but that's all CF going pretty evenly created in the mainland as well neither of them tonight too many to the tower fairly close in wave clear during the early stages but we're now hitting level two sixes for both of these men liners and the kill pressure is definitely they're definitely going to keep an eye on the jugular special that experience bar for Centura naddy just get the night is Wolfgang contracts on the way out there after stealing it and it's not go as far as match-up is concerned it is a 400 Gold Leaf straight up for santol in here but you expect in the first place I beat the farm difference is negligible get the same CFO also going to kill up there so more efficient to run Power Rangers number two or three jungler nna the split and looks like it remember also the dragon giving you significant gold now too and with a cam definitely helps a lot when you want to go for team objectives but you don't want to fall behind now you don't really have to concede anything just takes a lot longer than killing chickens will timing yep contracts definitely have a lot of births potential once hitting level 6 with Nocturne I eat does that flash ready and has gone conqueror so there's a huge amount of damage output that's possible he just need to get it into a lane and convert and I want to commend golden Guardians Early Learning despite the first Blood the 600ex for gold that's life ghost Tavern it's a tide game in Gold overall very well-informed the bottling up 15 as well even a slight difference in at 7 early on so these lanes are going well you can make you talk without really getting a lot of it is that the discrepancy in the bottom Lane definitely an old lady getting the last it's on minions even though every time we've Pan the camera over that land turtle and JJ have been the ones pushing and of course of Lucien bromwick one of the most aggressive in its various you will and you haven't really heal burn four reasons because of that match up but still holding off and I would say the eyes have been on this bottom line probably the most critique aspects of the go
you know when he said these guys in there going to be hyped up to play on the LCS stayed and of course they're going to help to do what they can become a hero so did make Academy playoffs be sadly did lose this week 3 to the echo Fox Academy Squad but player still hungry and I do want to do they have in store for us he was already putting in a lot of starting work on the main roster Point of View to a thrill but they're also more comfortable with sheliga who did play in the economy collapse map and of course A lot of people are going to point to why did they bring fake God in over some day they got an academy was getting a lot of hype but mainly it's going to be for the communication and their Synergy with the rest of the academy players now let's get right into it a lot of these early game Focus fix being banned out from 100 thieves jungle Focus as well on weeklyalright waiting to see if course if there's plenty of scouting reports available these guys didn't play their whole season in the academy Spotlight to you've got even more games on them that I'm in LCS team have to work so just got to go portable forced air there's the J steak in a way that God can't find this one but a collie in the finals for the gas bill Sykes picot play it again I would expect it to be in the hands of Fate God cuz he was still G&R Sean and thinking what I've seen that late-game team fighting has been good for them going to be expected Academy teams are quite so good or I have any players are quite as good at who the late game. Clean closing out so I think it's pretty safe place for the bottom dispatch who picked up your perfect iced tea have had a decent amount of long game so far in spring so it's reasonable to assume that but if they do walk in the callista thank youyou a lot of bottom line control it also gives you Five Below in front of snowball early dragons and I do like the champion in the meadow right now because of those factors as well they can create so many plays probably something like from here to get a lot of different offensive and defensive options in there as well right now and wait for his pic though is xayah and rakan a pretty expected to come through here against have fangs cosplay of Zaya at all stars definitely impressive as well as his place so happy to be on it once again combined with rakaan just looking to have that explode two-factor you can actually do decently well into callista Lane Surly in a few things first desire game and Sons 1st Rec on game of the split toe putting it through this practice me know how to not make playoffsmiss the postseason here as we're playing for practicing and in shaping up and has not okay for LCS team so to do well and if you're looking at Chesapeake Synergy has diarrhea con combo for the bottom line here subbing son tinh Phu all of the academy players by the way I've been very very positive about at start just when the more senior guys do on that line up and he's got a lot of far as coaching the strategy for the team and keep it immoral up happy I need him back on the LCS stage 76% compensation highest on the beam across the academy has been a good contributor and we'll see if we can do that if it's 6 a.m. biofrost after when I get to play against his old team here if he's been stepped out of 4th 4th Corner taken off the table as well as and we've got a flex pick a collie but both fall into the light Shone it was a syndrome ID for peelingalright skarner either I'm very excited to see what we go for in the jungle with progress and as you mentioned he actually hit rank 1 in the North American solo queue ladder and a lot of the games were ivern so I've been holding out for it give me the winky face but he's going to try and we've got of course he doesn't every game and we'll see what he actually wants to play pretty soon but they do need a top winner and a jungler or foot the bill at 2:20 to pick you doing if they want to make sure that it is going to be the akali 100% in the top ways before darshan submit to his fixed so it got to go juggler Fortier again another non-committal me to text Juanita and after shark tank for you had to possibility for initiation for Wiggly they already have a Kalisto with a bra attached to it so she'll be out looking like again very standard King by fosta Billare there five five looks very strong and two tanks and they are going to be ice cold in that front line and it got plenty millyard Garvin locked-in that's going to go most likely differ I guess you're so we haven't even talked Jarvan and indeed it has been played before but the last pic needed Now where's it going to go and Callie are going to be going into the middle enforcer you go and they have a lot of Pi progression to make a lot of space does the color to pop off another AP galio game picked up here so Elaine and I do like the combination jarvinen galio one of the classics bread and butter you jump in get a cataclysm down keep people around for the galley ultimate to arrive for the poppy very good use of the setbacks presence is possible here so many Champion a specifically against the ones who won with a Collie kids dapaah you smell as well if youbut at the right time here you want to get one of the high-value - you don't want to get one of the Seas backwards into it than such a star and all around Dash blocker you just get your 114 Champions but still locking your back liners they're going to see what comes through this one up here the first games of LCS proper your birthday con fracas and prismal to make their way up the standings within 200 miles, turn the coaches and off they go see LG as we mentioned there within their hands are expected to win this one and have a very important Matt Pickens echo-fox tomorrow they can do these things they can get playoffs have missed it all last year they can do it here though you're making a lot of Steel Japan's nervous freak with talking about expectations beer is the name comes from counter logic and a lot of the timehas been through to the organization will sit here that was definitely favored birthday is this 100 thieves roster that swapped up don't think that he's going to keep working his very best foot forward and find a couple of Wayne Theater must find some ways they want to make that pushed hoping to improve until the summer split now I see players are getting ready to go we do every type a report with Ava Lee and Chelsea oh sorry we will have a spoiler that is my fault and Kelsey don't play Monopoly chance we go quickly does passive oh my goodness freak always trolling I'm here with Kelsey Moser be head coach for the Academy team for a hundred thieves we're seeing 4/5 of the team in what can we expect from these players today we've had a really interesting up and down stairs with everything going on with the amazing that everything but these guys I think have shown a lot of development a lot of promise I'm really excited to take out on LCS I think a lot of people are ever since Sutton scouting grounds really exciting on there for them just don't feel comfortable together and that's what really what we're looking for we get got done early synergistic comp so that's what we're going for I'm also really excited to see how they do Kelsey thank you and best of luck to you and the team back to you guys that is kind of the classic to me you're hyped up so little and play are you get on the LCS stage you'll pick me up a collie Sonos works really they call a highlight Champion will see if you get a leave form stuff is going with that conqueror hear more about cool stuff for this week past 9.6 + chat over what we think and do we think will make playoffs as that push continue to look up come out every Wednesday so TuneIn especially if you caught the last couple episodes were going back our older format that we had was that was on the show see here as the plot of land does not quite get that lacks Auto Tech projects done here on Earth unjust mean for damaged by the way again one of my favorites is running the hell of a place on these claim Dominic Champions with Calista it makes your Chase down potential really strong because you can spot very quickly get off your Autos with your Hail of blades really exercise control early on level six first the wave pushed all the way in equilibrium actually and I want to see how the two on two players out from here but with that one main and stuck it actually if they left it very very slowly it'll push courts and make hundreds he's over at 10 to get Farm but looks like they're going to wait for me back and forth that won't be happening near enough level to power Spike going without blood on either side others are going to start Siri wants to use it on the Canon see if stunts moving up here in the brush decide to take an opportunity and not going to go thank you Google for a route but not just yet there we go. Delay biofrost little trays in mechanics are for the bottom lamp plays trying to threaten when you do have a lot of this potential again this is early game though and as you can see on the map the junglers have been denying a lot of information practices is flipped up here into the crowds done some counter jungling for himself before even going through his blue quadrant this is going to mean that weekly as a lot fewer options and often times when you're in this situation as progress you set your soul fuck you get a small eat in The Jungle by having extra can of clear but you need to keep your lanes notified because this is going to push Wiggly into a situation where he has no camps to go forth and he is forced to go for a possible Lane play the only way he gets back in and catches up is if your Lantern allow him to get that lane playoff go for a gank or you know moving out for the vision I don't have to make up some of the Mist Farm but again there is a reset and the the pack back through the struggles to make that happen so they both got their rights might they both got the control board so far life seems fine for multiplayers but I left her with me to farm here at the bottom Lane is decently volatile so both of them will probably have their eyes on bottom side vision control and progress is set up to do a kind of a reverse clear back to the bottom side if you start a crop wolves then Raptors will be the case weekly is going to try to cut him off at the past year though goes for the counter and they will be able to find himself the rapper can't even if a cup so he's not going to be behind at all and it's actually going to pull ahead here of projects because of the extra time at broad walk across the math weekly going did as well be found here just in case you're as stubborn as down four hundred thieves yeah progress there quick on the trigger finger with the flash there's weren't really in a situation where you're going to get a counter kill and at best I think he's trying to dissuade theology from going any further Anza League oh yeah but that you might want that flash back afterwards and it's a tough call I'm not sure to get it on Meme on the pots ideas for me through the shields up for file for lost and unsure if I could have knocked up cats legal alive or he's going to go away anyway I think at the very least you spend at the little extra time of walk that distance actually does go for the knock up a it was a good in a rep from Bob Ross this delay them but he stopped again doesn't go to it didn't have been in a Cuban NW back out so if you could let the recall but it's going to be that ignites are in play on the bottom side so a lot of attention will be paid here early on we can get all endings from either side the drug dealers are going to be the biggest resource that they fight over Frog the game actually passed over that Ward through the Raptors really should know it's a possibility he's here and see each other for the shield on so nothing of the game they're one of my favorite parts of sidhwani you know you can also pop the honey fruit walk over them with you or hit with the slows while you have your Frost armor on party what is level 60 or so stingy a level 6 definitely something there. Which could also play about this bottom triangle of the map very important and that's why we can see after the fur recall on your mini-map right now from file fraud is moving in trying to clear out the transmission pathway hear from mid and bottom as both of them are very good opportunities for CLT to capitalize in a sealed you have great Vision Center on the bottom side of the river so no big can be found in progress and it lets you eat keep pushing you to see little by little farm denied + 21 CFM inline up after sleep until 4 to get back to Ling's who actually abusive and he's actually been crushing this one-on-one so far with a bit of help from the team a Sony decide we're going to go because he'll be back but will not be sun but it's writer who started Mountain Drake and Lexington Estates of this one as long as you can push this one is topside and where the things I know this was practice quite often in the Academy games recently he got a lot of the objectives but it was from Smite dealing or trying to go for solo see her without vision from the enemy team he is going to be able to get this first match in trade for the team and just give you a decent amount of experience in addition to the extra cold now that it offers so very worthwhile pick up even though Mountain Drake's Barrett Ileana can't use to get more first place if you have a couple of seconds that mean the difference maybe you do recall timing and be a big thing if it gets based off a true damage from Moundridge just come in before
at the end of the stick in North America Viper rookie challenge heard from the ladder they need some ice a 10lb came up around the same time they played a lot in the academy league and Diesel was always a guy that everyone talked about this guy is a huge shock collar for the team is always a big playmaker and he has been kind of The Shining Star this time around of the new generation of Academy players that have been moving up kind of have an endless supply of them but they did we're doing very well for himself with turtle in the bottom Liane V Quest as well I really do think turtle and JJ has been one of the most underrated do I was so far the twitreally good in the typical Jinks wife was a really ahead of the curve as far as adapting some of the new pic turtle was one of the early want to jump on it and they also were aware that really wants to jump on the split fluid stylist Jackson ribbon is well into bed opting for red side the specifically for Top Lane split push counter fix which river Sandpiper are the premier players of in this league is a little bit interesting that they do go blue but if you're not going to pick your match up then maybe you pick a support championearly so they still kind of lending some of that chords that type of style Play the song is played at zero games in the champ but it just as well as saving a a low ability Kerry talked about it a bit on the dive as well but I really enjoy a chrome right now to super fun jump even better top laner and licorice is a guy the FBI can even at Worlds to great success story based boxes for players from both Licorice and Viper over here in a sexy diapers most played number to hear for liquor has to certainly would you consider an option as they expensiveI want to do we know the time fans 99.9% is before Champion down there is he could grab it really amazing Nola block is a mid laner here for Paul to so if you last chance account before they can start throwing bands away I didn't work Midway Morgana is going to come through this very very strong is good in to the place I love you too and especially with this is adapt gain any sort of fresh-kill pressure because it's so hard vs. Morgana away is very easily if you can't really make a dent in her house then it gets frustrating for now it's funny as Morgana actually in bottling is an absurdly good trying to pick into reckon you can reflux Black Shield to knock up so I are saying is it that timebe right now Steven Knapp wife is still a very good pic so a minor self going to be there for JJ will see what followers come through as long as there's a decent chance Kentucky running is in the bottom leaving or waiting up like that around cuz I don't do it on a screen so there was also a chance that come through it still very flexible has play quite a few Mages in the bottom Lane definitely an option if you take Sarah's fan out here as far as being a little bit worried about possible combinations for Morgana bindings can't explain line up with that as wellis we get a little bit deeper though so far flight Quest there is looking very squishy vricon and recs I both been super squishy very quick at engaging so speed has to be on your side and once again which speeded what you're relying on it supposed to help that it's all about your execution I don't have the skill to pull that off so I'm going to wait the better flight unless we can't quite a few times last played it was the last year in North America open the option to put in another tank 1/3 Frontline ER is Orrin is the hover here again we're still on 9.5 not 96 which has the bus 244 will still be locked inbut now we will it be in sneaky where is Morgana going cuz I don't know for sure and I don't think they have much of an 80s rest so I'm expecting an attack damage Champion here because Darvon is generally going to go with the senator helpful to build we have not seen very many professional Jarvan Warrior are you go they deliver with an 83 thing up speaky to get as many Auto attacks as possible in a team fight attack the Cloud 9 bottom line here Tom kench drinks is not certain how do you thicken lamp and I'll be instead look like xayah rakan disconcerning Midland Mortgagepython can't do the same thing I can really love you have to blow things up to Super interesting as far as how much the early game does get tilted it in their favor if at all because I really have to see some mutual ground domination for this to be successful offensively rolling with were blocked one of the things I would want to do that or God I cannot do his work better with the jungler to go find Kilz on the enemy jungler because with lots of follow-up are usually doubled super high mobility and a lot of damage but it's not easy to land of in shouldn't even be able to hit those on something like a LeBron for you phora rest I even get his usual Dodge the way at the very least they can hit but it still blind out of everything elseKobe is going to be some value in getting a mortgage on a Cloud Nine West 4th place in regular if they win here today let's see what they can do putting me a preview of the semifinals of the LPS and to get ready to go on to the rift for Cloud 9 vs flyquest got a shout out my boy turtle though also sporting a new Bolta if beyond the player cans their style heading into playoffs with confidence it is a bold Choice here covid-19I just wanted to talk about this game thank you very much. It's a great to see you once again I have to say in your recent Buckley actually supposed to fall today are you mentioned in your mattress Team Liquid that you feel like you maybe didn't set the team up in that drop for a while so how do you feel you set the stuff that's BS though I thought we got a really strong the jungle and then a good top-line because they banned a lot of black counters or gladly encounters so we really strong team fighting we have a 131 and they're playing a Tom kench with a split pressure so I feel pretty confident about this draft and hopefully we can execute correctly on it thank you very much attached to the guys for the call definitely an interesting take care of it does rely a lot on the execution and the boy about Tom catch now maybe bad things about Tom camps that people don't often talk about because he's so good at a table and sweep with me and nabal and cross that plays within a team fight he often does get out done by a lot of other supports again if you're able to save the Jinx during the critical moments with devour then that's all the value that you really do need to supply for a five on five jumps and get out of here at the are then she can do damage after work that would be kind of what it up to and if you are really looking further ahead to the V on V so hard to out play ornn initiation was Darvon and a black shield plus devour surrounding a jinx so we shall see if they can pull it off okay well right here and we'll see if Midland pressure can make that happen to the ward off Gryffindor jumping in the guardian Shields been at the W but two flashes burned for just the one who spends Karen yeah I mean afterwards but for one flashes in the bottom Lane it will be a deficit there for JJ and wild turtle they won't be able to go as aggressive looking for kills maybe for pecans benefit at least you can still have a way out of turtle Physicians defensively and they do get gang stuff I have to Saving Grace E won't have the flash of games later on but won't be 6 before that comes back anyway so that's you do not think you just problems and maybe again turned around as likely not as you do get a bit of momentum force and foreign right the rest I get to take a shuttlecraft there's a huge Chunk on Spencer and tell if you have to walk around the top side to get his own spittle the to fight pretty close to their flag still get somebody image optical store still feel comfortable what's in a Cuban manifolds pretty close to equal how far is about the same as Wayfair continue to your furnace key all right with your Morgana matchup especially early on into the blog just trying to use the minions to your advantage vanderpool's down and how do I set off LeBlanc what you go through United States are good for burn the flash it didn't use it when trying to save sincere enough for you to be able to come down there that's going to look really good enough for black was definitely does it's likewise with a health lead in the bottom side plus they're the ones with the teleport on wild turtle so if they can chunk out Cloud 9 for sneaky into a recall situations they they gained a huge amount of experience you get more damage on that or you can get to replace with a quick reset open early game teleport or definitely ain't going to be able to use a summers bail Advantage after JJ Blended his towards the jungler Yahoo beginning like wasn't something that fight 3 got Lost Odyssey 9 sides with lots of all that is left once again look on the steaks near Flatiron secure the bi flag poseable Lockport seed with respective went to these beams we wait to see now what else comes through is this Top Lane as you heard in Brits say mention it all the blood in your lane counters are gone so they could play it safely right now. I'm supposed to equal but liquor is certainly have been a really jumped out of Latimer here yeah there should not be a world where on or never solo kills of Vladimir know it night or anything here and there's nothing really to be worried about for plaid you can sustain Perry easily spamming your cues farming up so you get a little bit of cooldown reduction as well and feeling for that late-game beats I got a jar pancake in the socks you boys are going to spot him coming through and around Pittsburgh shortly a kill and if they'll be taking over my fence care in electrical perhaps it's going to go to the jungler under the turret turret damage here without any information on Spence Karen who shows up at the perfect time there for 9 and they convert definitely a bit aggressive I'm going to punch them so now the game NC 9th and Cypress Hospital a centaur's. Regis. This one even think you're helping okay so the base is finally spotted it that do spend that's going to be just fine message if I spent scaring scaring will the LeBlanc get close enough I think it's going to be a little bit of damage given over to fighting right here Congress stacking up did not get the Lamborghini for damage out there spending jumps away in a war zone down killed nobody else is close enough here to really make that play turn into anything else it does mean that Morgana was drawn away from that Wave by the way that's pushing towards pobelter towards the leblancs of Oregon a missing out on a little bit of gas during the time of trouble going to land the first thing and rates what does he almost was going to live to Atlanta point-blank binding understand turn away comes in on the right side not enough to save his life devices 1410 gold not given over Saturday to fly and they miss out in the 160 there but it's still turret damage overall is weak Bots
how many strong performers on the or overall 204 spots themselves the LPS what is maybe they can finals last spring and went to world with the squad but now we do have ourselves a lot of the bands have been very similar it was previously the irelia Cassiopeia and Jace is now in the Midland maybe there's a little bit of that they are going to be as far as any of the level six killed pressure that you can bring with the Champions were complaining Pierce and also both music irelia is the all-around go to make specially for Mid laners thattrying to set up their teammates and set up a lot of room tours that make it in okay weather might run down to the bottom line is Iraq on locked in the very early and extremely fast water grabbed it right away by our kind of hurt a great bottom line over the other lane bullies most likely down there so no responder and ricegum middle or top especially when you can get the combination in the round do pick order here was Diane work on being picked up with confidence level one outputs much more fresher with that combination we've seen people get early level kills on all sorts of Champions solution Flash from even accepted there so and then again band that very well could be on the bottom side we saw it last weekend if we'll have to Calista that's why I was banned here then going with you early game domination and I absolutely smashed thatearly game and still trying to do so on this if we wait to see what the Final Fantasy V Collective sigh driven away from broken play hoping that counter doesn't come through basement or match of who he wants to play yes still Banning a lot of Top Lane Champions even though the rise could be flexed up to the topside the galio very likely is support although the flexibility is still here just last night in Korea a long time recent. I'm going to lose my job position is designed around work on a lease Orlando address and you kill them instantly I don't have a chance to take the body away from Cloud 9 a lot for either team removed rooting versus broken blades akali mid laner in mid I am extremely excited for our going to have I walked in Legos for much much more powerful Lane dominant style and a collie will have a hard time dealing with that sort play the bank easily play up to the top side to get birth control and with a jungler like at least I expect his Clutch Gaming composition to take fire Leon 2016 week 9 real serious or clutches run will be cut short and they will not see the postseason piglet how do I fight you in a one-on-one another three on one when you dive MyLink might look better that we got to stop an employee's check in with you say thanks. I got a chance to catch up with Sebastian Park Park of Clutch Gaming to ask him a little bit about these last-minute roster changes that we've seen and he told me very bluntly listen or 5 and 11 right now we have low chances of making playoffs we need to make a change and that change is bringing back Midland and Cody son so that Cody sun is been performing an academy so they wanted to give him a chance at LCS today and bring a piglet to the mid lane is going to unlock amazing potential and Synergy all in the top side with both Mira and I'm excited to see it back to you guys yeah I not only have they made some roster moves here but even more exciting some Champions moves everybody's very very hyped up on who neon Lane dominant Champions bully champions in vain right now not only is she a strong of 1D One later up or something like the akali here but scales incredibly well into the mid game all you need your blade of the ruined King you're a razor blade and you can absolutely take over but do it when you can do here you can see already establishing that control as we talked about on the top side you can hover in the brush get the Autos off this greatly boosted by the fact that you got a couple of those Callaway's autosoft waiting for broken play to walk back to you right now he just got his first & Main Event of experience of the entire many ways and the biggest thing here you touched on your loving skarner and professing your new home is not going to do anything to rectify the situation is carnivorous at least the early game is at least his kingdom here so it should be about Lyra keeping Looney in this situation all you really even have to do like people just sit there yet awardee Fitness Garners topside jungle and there should be no influence here a bank and Tumble away from skyner Dodge out that he can also condemn this Garner backwards and the only thing scar has a surprise factor is Flash and I was going to be the thing to look around then if it does come through or the front light can think up and think back to hoody's Infamous Lucian top Dan against TSM an amalekite outscale them I'm not sure Galia was trying to reduce like the same here in this one but yeah Frontline so 5 and 5/8 fairly equal is probably tough for them will wait to see if that comes through is the middle and two fighting off the fence that is really true and I feel like luck gaming are going to very easily quickly pay their taxes are the Quicksilver Dodge is going to be necessary if they can get those on their carries than Acadian becomes much less useful yes you can point out the way we got honey actually going to have somewhat fun to get one here and you can see of course I can try to make sure that probably does not get do if your body at least but with ensuring xpf even more serious is going to miss for this so still going to rain behind Winnie and then do to change the situation you come over and hug the Tower with them and they can hold hands under there while they watch CSI at the truth but other than that it is just a rough life for a call here in this Lane and who needs should be able to continue his ways now the main player I'm looking at though even though that's a cool match-up is Lira there is only at least for the game juggler Ramsay quits to dye your repel you can drop tower Agro she has execute damage so it's going to be a lot about beer also proving himself why do they keep him on this line of rebuilding this team Around lyrics this is a game that they have to win they want their playoff spot I think he's a player that has to perform and I will see his first Bloods and pretty good the early in fact I've been okay for collective in the mid-to-late game that have fallen off and I did mention drink Champs like Cody's been known as a late-game hard for him and Carrie and as long as he gets his right resources and they get to the team fights with a gold lead to handle the tanks maybe looks good at aiding running around to the Jungle looking for and against the might be office for minutes to take the camp tender respond but so far not finding any gold income for himself just an aggressive towards that we are will not spotted to go through his own jungle taken away some of the Raptor Camp right now what does collapse and help we're a bit as he chases them off so Katie is going to have to get back to his own side right now leaving. Spotify control Southern jungle to follow the red box that's what a katydid at this time thank U observers that has yet to see something that is so far they're not tracking litter but she goes to Crossville then know that what side he's on me because the chance of Brooke medicated to do something what is the weight for 6 before that becomes anything good right now 44 to 20 in CS is that toppling Mark mid and bought though a bit closer to equal and we'll see how many of these broken plates you grab and he tried to get now have to see if he has them will believe any of the rest I would also say it's very beneficial for Clutch Gaming the first dragon here is an infernal Drake Dragon some extra pressure towards the bottom side as a metronome starter once again went topside they're just following up on the crowds right now and pick was going for the invite but we had a ward though his first one just miss that we passed it earlier so they actually know he's waiting for this looking for what invade might be probably knows he's safe and sound is not coming up so he's able farm and then it goes back to Lane all right checking back in on the bottom Lane keeping amount of Cs leave here for it's been and smoothie. So far doing quite well for themselves galio I really love the support taken a lot of okay yorkson 6 does not have TP about the flash we need zip getting away no harm no foul and I like just looking at the positioning there you know if you're very very good knows that he does not have Vision on that top side with a controller that cluster able to put down to keep playing defensively doesn't extend himself knows that delete is on the warpath fairly odd looking for games on the Beast always when you feel the way I am going to try to go to the topside still going through a war this timely response with the sweeper then go to the pieces on the word comes down and still around topside that's not the first hole for out for Broken Blade has he is hextech revolver and the ultimate access is here so this is the window pretty soon especially if he is in his six that they can make it home from that vein game that Fain Lane around yeah I mean you can be down and still hit Level 6 on a collie and go for a kill right eye definitely a lot of burst damage in the kit once you get access to your are button Katie and does have a control board on to this infernal Drake but not too far away actually look up tethered it doesn't matter because there's a good GSM control work in the back of the pit as you should you write under the scarn right there so they know that there is Vision just worried about can he do anything about it both men are mid laners have recalls so you don't want to come too risky on oh playmate for that occasion life-size XP was 5.1 got a long way to go to the ultimate avail bottling brush ganc Boca Toca que oh nice Ward what's a down they knew something might have been a mystery Ali smartfly you saw so he's been very far away in case I'm going to have to jump was able to do so no need to get away from my brother all right this is kind of the one point of power and offensive Lane for TSM Right Now lyrics trying to turn it around just out of fog of War you say bait in a move from TSM it. He might be the one to do it I think I don't know if skarner could be here as well the only thing smoothie ever that works been turned up every time so gen 3 V 3 may be a bit of a possible Punisher they just can't put as far as even though they're actually outnumber the opposition we know akali can't keep these what do you burn his recent as well as sugar first item to not get all in assistance paying put down there by TSM members I think they're calling for a room down here maybe from Acadian after work. Going to be able to get level 6 off this 50 standing office mid with blue selection of a canyon has to be bossed side so now they know and I can still try and the patience pays off for Clutch Gaming assistance pain goes unheeded there and it is going to be a kill over but the akkadian take this moment to clear out the controller will he go for the dragon afterwards knowing they were recalls bottom starter cancel this dragon by the way very very strong on the Spire right here give you plenty of attack speed looks like it's going to do so so that is not without a cough syrup and infertile Drake for CSM their kind of happy to get that on the back half of the first Blood going over with how many games has the could be a very big deal for them going through the middle Lake game as the Drake goes down to text Darcy goes to Acadian and that Dragon earned by smoothie and sven's play here in the to V3 even though they do give up The Kill by they do a lot of damage initiation there from Vulcan get the full combo on this bench and they turn their side towards for the year to the Gallo can't back out even though he starts ultimate with the extra Shields nobody from CG does go down toppling remains a farm off for now looks like it's getting tightened up a little bit Broken Blade not going to get much CS as before with extra ability power to last hit minions and level 9 will be a bunch of damage on that to you when it comes through and look at a lot of them with that
can this change is an effort to get the team back on trap no climb back up into the tendons there at that bottom Clump for and a spot right now and they'd like to make some Headway here moving toward playoff contention within striking. So going to pay for coming in and it has sadly been nothing but disappointment but there's still room turn around 10 and 8 should almost certainly make playoffs it's nearly a guarantee 408 smooth sailing Nico bands coming through yet to be strong if you've missed it even without the bus on 9.5 very very strong even though broken blades plated withdedicated team that want to win through split wishing Broken Blade on Jack's broken plate on split pushing to victory has been their style that they have fallen into now it's found their stride through the mid-season definitely an interesting because these are two teams that have gone in opposite direction to put five in one run for tsma one and five runs across the last 3 weeks and you can kind of see the record look opposite as well as for the Shocker here we'll see what the eventual answer is for bang later on as they taking a very long time blocking is Champion six delivering a lot what they want with the composition alright bill for Spain has been a go-to for many years now last season he had a tremendous amount of games on the championand it's a very common combination with Tom kendzia provide you with one of the most defensive bottomlands that there are in the game that also Dale's really well it's not super well with split bushing copper blade usually on a strong solo laner that will split the map up and Tom can't you could use the Abyssal Voyage to game timing window take effect is like ours wasn't around hoping outfits with Pusher as well or take the most-played support for Smoothie in the Alistair and they banned way that says Ronnie of a kitty and so there are two of the most curious if if you will walk in a good engage champagne fromthey've also locked in the skipper here for bang definitely a possible super Lake and carry the 500 CS condition server has been around for a long time even in Lane three of them anyway very quickly do like the new Essence Reaver as well composite hard to beat saber into though I think it's hard to fight of a plot with your mites Auto she's in range Newport house damage do you spell steal one of the Spells but it's still painful and everyone of course he's a type of that is formed by big slow so so the ghost of chronic Adam he's played a lot of these default teen site may just Rising band out here LeBlanc Twitter pic blind for Bjergsen throwing down the gauntlet hey we've got one of the dentist. D best mid laner in the entire league you're putting in your Academy Mid laner what do an assassin because they have confidence in fjords in for that lay meanwhile on the 100 East Side they continue to focus on that split push that stone over and over again with play band cover for a Urich thick you're going to want to go for that one as there are two of the very best matches in the temperature on board of play liquor still good your facts about their broken plate also with an option picked up that is a good reinforcement for a split Pusher to 100%. The only question is what will their solo aim for the top side that they can get a literally trying to break down some of these Powers early on and spread out the map does not turn Comcast Israel and the block are all components that you want to flirt with a very powerful splits with your side they want to stay as 5 over Speed Booster Alistar your Jarvan to go get that heart and gave your aatrox is a great front liner utilizing the ultimate for that timing window of the revive coming back up this is a very for basing five-on-five setup that they just want to find his rhythm in North America are the top set against Sunday on the edge Rock and wanted to see broken plays irelia Riven and Yasuo it was those were all part of the YouTube highlight video CSM put out when they pick up broken play from the TCL a lot of hype was generated him coming over turkey he's really melded well with the team has gotten here let's see what we could do though because a lot of fans of and trying to Rally around this mean for a while you mention their 5 + 1 + 5 slides interesting wildcard they pulled here to switch out who Lee who he put in the soul ego time is now that make you sad that you're outside of slap you got to make up some games to play the first one who has done better and better as a split has gone later to read to me return to form they never miss an LCS finals and they missed it back to back last year the Miss World the first time ever as well just is Robert looks a bit better maybe it's their return the distributive game for them I Got Talent season with a substitution as well but it remains to be seen as totally go can step up if hundreds he's going to turn it around and find their way back into the playoffs are the four finalists LPS sitting in last place around the wrists let's go to game bathroom Buddha started out with the cowbell bangs with the sneaky cosplay that we do have a word with trolley the hunted these coach to talk about this matchup thanks guys probably so cookies out so we goes in what was the decision making behind bring your cabinet liner and today he's actually been having a really good showing at Academy and then screams has been a good performance as well so it made a lot of sense to give him a shot on the big stage even though he is planning a person who's a good mid laner had a good showing against them in scrims too weak against Spirits in some kind of excited put them in a single match up today any advice that you gave him to go against such big huge Titan in the LCS not big ones just playing against the champion Like A Champion as In Like Flint Blanc the champion and I like Champions champions he's played play against before so that's something you can deal with and he's played on the stage before seeing as how you like the emotional aspect about the crowd cheering to use it for his Advantage probably thank you so much and wishing you both the best of luck back to you guys so I think I can be summed up as turn name plates off ya play against the champion rather than the player although I'll be honest I can turn the lights off but your son is different from letting in some like flat to Mid laner you can tell her I did like what kind of talk about what he did quite well they're so super excited see how this midlane does playoff but once again the story for GSN games split push get their paw planner ahead Broken Blade keep them inside land and everyone else brass campion's around that that work well when the enemy team is very spread out now a lot of the time for guys you like that to work you do need a powerful early game start getting those towers down early and getting control of division I never recall this would be silly cuz you by the way he's at the middle and against dierksen got a triangular coming around through award so you didn't move until I am fully came through and do you want to wait a little bit more time I was told they would drop name plates that was a lie. You're going okay so far Sunday you know what spider has like three triplets use any kind of dance around do somersaults yeah I mean it when aatrox rework was first so it's like ribbon yeah broken playsets you're a pretty good job and his son there but he's doing all right for himself is it a shot Sunday Christian time anyways it does feel more like kind of like a fighting game in the top play now that we have 8 Bucks versus really I do like that you are a little bit more complex than that champion that's all right that we saw the tide game very early on no obnoxious laning phase leaves in fact it's pretty good. they told me to do what I want to pay him off well done my friend fix things on the top side and I do expect a decent amount of effort we put into that lane someday to me has been the highlight star for 100 season in their losses no getting eaten advantages sometimes for most importantly he is against one of the key players for TSM where to send a foot broken play their new player on is our town roll get the first one is well and they both go for the play this time around 100 speed jet the kill it goes to someday us blood money that's the way they want to set it up let's take another look radiant goes in here with Broken Blade all the time and they don't quite get him out of his cute as it's done came in the game continues to commit there to try and go forward someday still able to dash out though in a Honda can finish up that kill that's at the heart rate because of course with driving coming into both chose to flash the flash Ford Broken Blade flashed out and we always had an unfortunate picked the wrong play with each other that we've been examining with this team over for quite a few of their games in the ALCS been specifically with those two players they have had different ideas about how to play the game that was a very clear illustration of it one in one out as you said need to have a little bit more time I guess the to get to know the Tendencies of love your teammate feel like we're running out of time you should definitely get those down probably securely in the quarterfinals birth but he's really like a good seed and you can compare that to all the guys are pretty close and maybe only a game a half behind him with a lock ski refuse them does drop is a single game behind losing out on 3rd place better things that we did finally get some good dinner to go on top, that was definitely present for us for a while on them and on Sunday despite playing for more than a year together since last year together 100 thieves maybe getting a little better over time then why we can check in on the mid lane is well with the legal than the Academy Mid laner coming in for 100 days he's hit Level 6 on the dendra they're both going for the recalls. Waiting around because there's a big minion wave anytime is a Advantage for the enemy talk later and there's a big minion wave crashing you have to think weight are they going to try and dive are they could try and make our talk later miss out on this finding Way by forcing it that's why I gave you sitting there in the brush waiting for a counter place at looking for an offensive play good stuff though no diving the probably Gainesville to get to see a difference down here and that are up in that Top Lane even despite the hill coming through and be earlier like you buy something for him off and he's just a 90 casters to look at that I can't find a way in Sunday cutting it away after use it very high Alp and Sunday trade back defective Lee really nicely done and TP of work already down for Broken Blade and very very low health regen very well is for something is very big for the two compositions for what they want to accomplish really on in this game than 100 these can control Top Lane like this and make it very hard for kids have to actually open up the map and utilize their strengths meanwhile it's so easy for us to see through flashlight
this is the game everyone came here for Team Liquid versus Cloud9 at the top of the standing patio already off the band phase deer this the champion A Team Liquid actually got more than any of the other teams and I was expecting to be from a bad it was before the nurse even came in this game. You must have been at themselves as well as the Kindred with both of these players have had very big plays on in their professional careers the number to see if the final bands coming through you notice the map that both these things were looking at for a probably more than just this week but they did the previous week as well and really pulling into with a fat is Steve who would win this fight and she knows a lot of talk about these two teams practicing against each other most because the top teams generally form clumps of scrims and bottom teams for more clumps of trims Canada day they definitely come to know each other fairly well I'd say so I'm super excited to see how that plays on stage and more becoming a school support for the Jays played at the single time in fact the only galio player on his team right now as far as current split LCS we know for the completed what is unlikely so I can grab quickly here in court today I believe has one of those pins for himself I want to play it on one of my favorites will sneaky play these is skin the Wilds give ruler a shout out to movie the lovers do although in a round lock in here for a dancer like the Allosaurus 100% off and that's where galio is not nearly as a thank-you or have the surprise Factor without the flash that can really punish a wreck on the same way those other two can so that's why she not old enough to go with this double locking it was good of a Lanner galaviz I agree he's not super tank Elissa get darker after sucks that futon you can play around but if he does land into the the right afterwards. Seuss toxic I see if you can actually a low House camping but it's one where you have to play Aqua to make that work and a person I was that are fun the tall guy charged up to get a bigger area there for myself and speed is a bigger measured against when you're against to work on let's see you do a block and a J's have both been blocked in base to me has been just an extreme power pics on this patch and it actually goes through to the second round of a fixer I think that's very happy there 14 liquid be able to pick that up it's flexible between multiple lame and not necessary it doesn't have to necessarily go up against the Sandra I do think it would be strong liquid have going on right here is even if Space Coast Melanie pointer Pitbull stop playing. Kaiser with a decent match profile is up still as well to look in a lease or a Fraga spell you're not hemmed into one damaged by if they have old with flexibility here and not connecting to be really nice for you because you know you can move that Jace Crown you can put them done before as well alright Garvin & LeBlanc. The table here for cloud nine bending away we expect impact to pick up a tank so maybe not the dates but he is also played a lot of bruises very effectively and he has also had that game on the chase where he did the currency was able to take down to Turks with no Champions defending them so I guess you could get up maybe a little happy face sticker for that you or outflow you how you talk to me to grab here though and that's where that can still go jungle or Tom plane so she not going to wait to see what comes through and make sure they get the match if they want him looking out to show their entire lineup and I think that's both misky and licorice have had very strong games on Xbox that would like to see you one of these solo laners take it flickers have an amazing flank around to win the game for them versus Sam Hart engaged Smith's gas Wellhead solo kills against who in the mid lane and they were able to win that game as well so I really like the fellow in a box pool Cloud 9 Spa near locked in both those players that the jungle players very thick as well does work very well with Jay-Z can go melee form and stack is the sun's a very swiftly effected Jace looks like it's going to the top when is Oriental be the match of indocin Drake here after we're doing this thing to LeBlanc band from earlier on so Cloud 9 now know their matchups is it a trucks in 2 days or does it go to Jungle you pick a different counterfeit York my go to report that was banned a way to look at don't want to see that match up at all for themselves the licorice what is your pick against the thing he's going to go for the old call back maybe poppy used to be so going to Jake's Wayback the day you just simply with Spam the damaged forever and you skilled infinite tank if you never wanted me like you want you to be really good against good against Calio good against this brings me back to 2018 when Liquors was first put on cloud nine and we're talking about him being that carry flare-up in the top side of him trying to grow into tank they comes out Terry's Cloud 9 when they're having a rough time switch in a lot of their star player is between the academy team copy of a massive laning phase for himself in the ones you have. He made a lot of plays a good length to get those charges into the wall off the champion I think it's just so good into the Team Liquid line up we saw into the interview is at the Players outside the parking lot has a really good idea to give licorice to beat Team Liquid with so good against the five Champions Hoover be single long cool down Dash to really don't want to lose out on the kit and I take a chance again be a good thing. Plane takes a penis but who's going to win the battle for control of first place we've been here lots of players get ready smile to the face it just one Jensen vs. nisky the first time around Team Liquid and Jensen get the advantage to waiting and here's your second chance summoner's Rift here we are in first place Cloud 9 in second but that could all change about 40 minutes here at the base Gates drop let's see what the level insanity is North America's best domestic and international performing teams going head-to-head right now for a lot of ragging rice but also a very big step up in the standings as far as who will likely finish in the first place by if you would get their head-to-head Victory here you know winning both games in the regular split versus Cloud9 it was very hard to knock them down the standings they would have to lose to the other teams that have to lose three of the next five games and they just haven't done that. Of course we do have a word with the Cloud 9 coach about this match thanks guys Reaper Team Liquid versus Cloud9 now you have trained them both Jensen vs. nisky who is the superior midliner they don't like the loan they want to stay to meet so I think Cinderella better matchup into Rihanna so this time around missed you can shut down Jensen this time around all right well this time around that's the game that counts Weber thank you and good luck back to you guys but I like the way he said that it was better they both like to stay in Lane Seaford we all know you think Jess is better Rihanna match up to me has been so interesting because as reproduce alluding to the Centrist does have an element of kill pressure versus the Oriana for a lot of the game you know when she hit that level six or and it does have to watch out for that but there's a reason Oriana stop to pick in the center here we go at level one that has the Red Bluff Karen also playing against his old teammate there goes too deep under the tower as soon as I started I could have had that feeling you do as a jungler if you do this sometimes diving in our Solar late is just too deep you're not going to be able to get that kill there's a heel on the hill or barrier they are winning as we have seen so often but let's take another look at this Howard I. Spence Karen make a red bus level 2 Gang versus old mid laner then goes in deep doesn't hit it and that wasn't even the 3rd one yeah so nosey flashes right that's for sure kill if you flash the right distance but he's all right overshot it well down to Mechanical Miss play their then off mechanics that's a heartbreaker what happens here and it's a 500 goal difference for the other first Blood you don't get quite the full of cysts cool very early on to the game and it is a 700 gold lead now for team liquid is in fact not blame but ourselves matchup it only took about four levels to turn around and Poppy would become invisible shield Craig's away and your nose is probably missing Yankee pick up the little babies you left behind I believe maybe 20 goals in his pocket but as we started talking about the bottom way once again doublelift and chords JJ be the best bottom line in the entire league that we have they're pushing up against a Zone Stevie that got it for themselves early on they either way it would go up and get this fellow crab which is not a huge benefit of having a winning bottom when they saw this young Killers go mid so they knew they had a free route or to Scuttle crab to get even more money and safety and vision for themselves to the workout has played for the jungle cake yes but as you were saying Papi year for licorice has been such a strong Champion even though it is a tank here we go full reindeer on his own certainly there's no way to write what has been wrong for in fact they get the kill back and pushes in the lane and incense candles as you decide you want to go up on the top side so he shouldn't get the next bottom stuttle at sponsee or try and get some more safety for the C9 Duo that one right back it was five cs plus $2 craps at Freddy's bought lanes and now they're about the same spot I got a lot of experience while these minions and wild licorice died in the topside it was pretty much a full level up over has been scanned there since gusting level 4 office cut off so the atrox a little bit behind an experience as there a BofA trying to Output early pressure in this game the game is still 700 ahead Team Liquid doing a good job is it straight out from there as the cleanse for a later stage one again and we've hit that level six Mark where the guy has huge fuel pressure on the Oriana Soriano tries to stay back Dodge confused fun to just go for the CSI what's the first star recalls on a plane as well stick he's been to the Tire man in full so could be here that he goes for it as the other bodily will inherit a Cantu wave it is not unlike most pro games you can make whatever you want and you can actually this one is actually pretty good Regal timing here it's pick up stubble longsword Beaver force was buff back in 9.4 so if you don't lose that much priority Russian the item first compared to like a BF sword Infinity Edge push and it should be pretty reason it should be pretty easy match for early on helping her make you soak a big birthday image in her kit if you can go for a trade I don't know how much you need the manor refund can spam it's very use it away from your old man a fool doing it but you don't have to but it feels good regardless we are going to see his whining shown on those Wards The Observers passed over in the red jungle hear those words actually going to pay double dividend drugs either Gallo from here after recall very common for the for the 10-minute Mark 4 supports boo head out to a different Lane rather than heading out through bottom that's the go on help your jugular with Warden Brad maybe make a pass at Genki 1 of the solar wind is there in 15 fishing here now sequani is going for the invite and had faded way around this might be coming around nice job get away from that one something away just the flash came through is the courts take down a Summoner all right definitely going to be a little bit more vulnerable here on the galio not level 6 get either so you can't help out with a jungle invented they do suspense Karen but he's got the timing hair do on the flu should be able to get it low enough might be a pretty close if going to be almost
deals are the top three in a bottom 7 if they have big games to go back and neck here every game counts so incredibly much for this playoff race already a lot of these very strong solo Lane Champions we've been seeing put to use split pushing being banned out by the tide of Steel she's the ribbon the chasing band out on hit Biko very popular right now and one of the most insane until golden Guardians also following along here and also Lane band that's far we'll see what they actually get down to of course also worth pointing out in this game it's kind of educating have stuff in Moon & Auto in the Champions new and has played a single game of the earlier on and Autoas previously I asked him about it when he was in makeup earlier today though and he was very impressed but I'm back in the LCS trying to make the moves it's definitely one of the academy players that has had a transmission on and off the LCS stage for many years. Very good player Tennessean come up as well steal she had a good track record of bringing up your won the ALCS in his very first split replacing weaker as of late but you have high hopes by file frost date for scampi and himself is Raven's rest comes through that's going to be exciting as well to see what the sport pick will be I was expecting a little bit higher priority on the super early game jungler like recti here but the West pic of Jarvis has been locked in earlier at people who rememberis Darvon game that you did very well into a j switch difficult matchup and he was able to speak as out Fiesta Jace actually do that jungle filled their options open will do it to it looks like you go but the options going to be the love lock midlane for frogging did not win I'm a champion that hasn't better on street fighters are poke but on the champion here to take to take over from the game and personally I did think that he was a good LeBlanc but maybe the team not necessarily accustomed to that really work as well when you have to play differently Novant looking to clear out towards find those pick off a hundred percent is 0 somebody has been go for the objective or the team fight not necessarily their similar strategy we've come to know and love with the lake that have come through for himself it's already looking likeRavens rash bottom line early on that we hypothesize what would happen more in the LCS as time went on with everyone sticking Azrael and just kind of waiting through the lane phase when will teams start to play a little bit earlier start trying to punish that go for the dominate them blankets for a place to get dragon I'll definitely in early in Domination lineup here for ggf blowing up yetis real important things up but that seems quite not quite as strong as other times they might play so wait to see if the bands coming through cinder blocks from power of evil York band away is the LG I will have to probably guarantee their actual top laner before we ever see what how to fix the top light. Driving can be flexible to the fourth York one of the Olsen Champion sociology last Mega to be Leaf then been away from contracts contracts definitely has utilized least in as well as early other early games Wranglersget frog and a head I think that has been one of their keys to success in these five victories has been contracts visiting groggins Lane early that allows fragen to completely control his Lane and especially on a champion like LeBlanc if they pay it forward strategy where the jungler can canker LeBlanc and Matt LeBlanc get to level 6 you're way more powerful than a jongleur going to get ink and sohila Blancos and take the different Lane to get everybody ahead so the rise been locked in the Box going to see where he's going immediately afterwards or hovering a zillion somewhat blind pop when we know a cartoon of course jungle and that would be just fine I know blank is something that actually be going into the mid lane to answer the blocks half-blind top and we actually goslightly more popular jungle sales in professional play and I especially so loves you will see 10 and his Premier Lane bully basically right now don't you start the tragedy they're they're going to go for it but it does mean that are 100% all in on it earlier Focus bag that we talked about with the Raven bottom line China boy with the LeBlanc looking to get control early than roam around now they also have a massive advantage in Lane in power for the Top Lane Advantage year with a range champion this is going to have to be golden Guardian setting the temple and TOD trying to weather the storm which honestly has been the situation I still do you have been in a lot of their games they have usually picked more feelings than their opponents half in the particular game and try to rely on waiting till later than bringing the tank through and getting the heart of gauges off will it is darshan on spy on Spotifyseason when he's on a champion kind of logic gaming here 5 and 7 alongside Golden Gardens he's tied for fourth place are absolutely within read and is absolutely in the car's Bluetooth module see if they can in fact the cheapest as I get us loaded into the game we will see who strikes first DLC making some last-minute switch is here as we head into the real thick of the playoff race bringing in two of their Academy players very excited and it was five straight weeks of the same players same players in and now very late in they are such a get back around that I hope it's the right to go in the postrocking on your screen and it's time to go into some of those Rich counter logic gaming face and golden Guardian he was six games left to play alright summer Leaf anxiety coming down looks like defensive opening for both teams as they spread out cuz we going to try and get your early Scuttle crab Lord down if you were these jugglers are going again like we had talked about in champ select we expect the early phase to be readily important for Golden Guardians and especially contract so we'll see if you can get any early information on that aatrox jungle cuz he has so many options of all the lanes have a possibility of setting up ganked and being very aggressive it's very important for steel G to try and track the enemy jungler so far we have a lull in the early game and if you wait for this one to start in Earnest if you want to hear more about the golden Guardians and arrow joint Kobe is a love myself on the dye for he mentioned that he's preoccupied with being involved in the conversation for top teams in this week's episode to hear more from him about Golden Guardians so far this year of all the top and he just wanted a crack at them to be able to exploit what he saw was wrong you know with TLC 9 yet Sam hopefully they've also got strategies for sale cheap that is one of the most important games here trying to get a win and deliver a loss to one of your competitors for the playoff spots could easily be your quarter-final phone as well save some how you perform so it could be a very important match up and of course I do they make the playoffs between your quarterfinal certainly in the cards for each of these two teams if they try to shape up in time for what's essentially week 10 van service in 4th Street Metro in flight tickets Autotext down and feeling some decent damage kleptomancy E Auto auto will of course trigger twice they are in so far so good bullying sign if you expect in the early game I am curious what his eventual build will be starting play does not mean you're not going to go a few later on if you goes a p me to get to Dayton flight to try to pick off that bottling Ezreal later on at the team fights did you go attack damage your old fart very good and you're dedicating his foot couple of options open I feel like especially against died on the on hit can be very effective because it does include special damages with the blade of the ruined King but again if you're trying to end the game through forcing at the objectives and you're not 100% committed to the split pushed that's where you see the AP pills come in defensive ghost or was not going to stop contract and take him with his bluebuff but that said both sides her and take you to the struggles regardless so not all that important otherwise yeah I mean so you remember about the ghost Braswell this game oh my goodness that is exactly the way you want to start off a Draven game crashes into cash in that much cuz it's so early but he gets the first Blood Money it's just a great host Viola way right past the Canon minion there and definitely doesn't hesitate The Flash Sable to pick up the kill what a rough start for auto here coming into the LCS the support just gets hook not much he can do doesn't have Hela to teleport Azrael can do anything to save the time cash and now it is going to be packed box number one for this early game composition emphatically checked absolutely and honestly it does feel like a tomcat just one of the better Champions to kill he's actually incredibly level dependent for his tanks and have any active take pills outside that and it flashes down his exhaust system in the bottom line instead of a combat Summoners you cannot help your support out everything set up to fill biofrost it did happen here and I'll be there another one now he's white Top Lane side as well as darshan getting worn down below 200 hp actually it's getting all that close and that will have to be a TV back to Lane I want to see contract start to play aggressively here with the atrox is going with his first clear so I was going to reverse clear now the rest of the camps but with these very powerful Lanes we talked about in champ select you want your jungler to utilize that pressure take away from the enemy jungler so that not only are still losing but you also want to try and make their jungle lose because their lands cannot come support them I'm watching the jungle camps bit later on right now I got to find out how rough that recall was for darshan he gets just the rejuv who can I feel pretty bad right there Hunter she converts his staff back to Ability Power by buying this The X Factor revolver which it lets him get the damage attack but also you have no less attack damage over all cuz you're around I'm not even sure it's only item but in these device and slinking around and the revolver definitely is super valuable for harassment will see about the bottom side of the map do because it's a very good movement here from moon to slip in and grab the Scuttle crab before the bottom-line returns and it's something that people should pay attention to a little bit more as recall timing during the recall hear of this very powerful event to go to spend that first Blood Money get his extra fuel Bixby F sword first year you have a small window on the map a little bit less than 30 second to try and do something on the bottom side get to Scuttle crab you get permanent Vision here leading into the dragon and a little bit of defensive security and of course she talked about that I recall timing having the money for the BS or in the second or inflated for the stuff to be here on traven very easy boss texted up to you and W and you have a cast animation you just have to turn them on twice anyway and that works out pretty well for him and he's got money and he's going to try to think you to keep trying to cash in right here but he's dead Over Heels about the attack speed I really really do think you just mark it is finally getting the recognition it deserves as well as helps you guarantee those Powers bike in the rain and now the health bar for auto extremely low. Just last post and you sucking right now in the golden Guardian on the bottom side they're going to force them off of this have to give us a place for space Auto wanted to jump all the way around and it was that where you went but it will be through the extra gold coming in. I think it's time to put down and they got it in Fox Sports 4th of Red Bluff in Bay Pier didn't stay around to finish off this current place as you can see it hasn't fallen yet still have five I do like that though they're listening to the PSA come help your jugular we are making a play in bedding for the Red Bluff power bill gets changed but it is Aftershock rise during the W in the Blancos it's so not really I will say though gigantic Farm lead to frog and Eve with this picked up it's still a fuss 5 or so see if it'll leblanc's is going pretty well for him and go to the Guardians on some of a full court press winning everywhere 15 is a really sad but again we've remember this is sort of unexpected game State through the Champion Select maybe not this big of a lead with you early first blood but this is a more early game 4
and Silas take out the table a big butt Big Bear Jason taken away deer abandon us again AJ's monster did play yesterday had some strong moments in the game but I think the problem with Jason an A in general has never really been that they don't have any good moments as they can't Lane if that have struggled to close out games and struggle to use two days to do that to really explode their leaves that Jason and take over the game of the big game and then just close it out before the extent of sorts of fall off but that being said another flight to pick be been a lot of girls always CJ spot yasso can certainly be flexed into multiple roles with our last year as well so Flex picked the name of the game in the band so far and then LeBlanc also gone as far as I know I tried playing it not my style who you're not going to put yourself first I look like 10 speed force plate good into most control Mages you jump in there you you get passing the ranges in and do a bunch of birth so also going to piss up the beatGarden swing South be his own you need to Camp right I feel like he has had the most success on the car that doesn't Victor and even his anivia detour to fix that other people are not really playing but he's so damn good at it fits the way that he wants to play the game and I think it makes the most sense for him I know there are kind of detractors of that foul thing that he should be sticking to metal pics but I actually think that if you can play with the level of Mastery also these pics that are outside the bed of it yep your opponents have such a hard time actually preparing for you still cure a Nivea players birthday via no one wants that practice I get the back of Egypt's golden on the flip side but there was not a soul whose getting prepared for that and I think it really can be valuable either way I lose on the tables going up now as well as if I was going to make a pick up here on this one has get from the Champions Boulevardyes certainly is it's much more about you being able to push to block it does actually hold area around until DEC has been fighting pizza dough easy when you're coming towards her and she has been in control Elena got poked can be very very terrifying and exactly who he playing The Victors out of Frog and Toad book you're grabbing much more the control made the frogs have a lot of sex at dawn and parody in the draft so far yeah that's the Cure can still be flexible we know someday played it earlier on in the year but all those things as though he who is ra9 9.9% going to the middle and diabetes body to say yes in tears are more than a band spirit I do things very likely from Disney's Gambino exactly as you say that it is zooming the bills are both the mid laner allusion in The Passage through the bandplay we'll see if old and Guardians can actually go get a leave down for themselves in that to be to where they haven't been as effective this year certainly has as receive these guys been in Nocturne been here for a hundred things that feel like slippers and can often be a very good win condition for them and not for a couple of split pushing well with the 131 you join in some YouTube sideline we Sauced smells like that kind of stuff back in the day was malphite Nocturne to be one that worked okay but they're not going to get that one that's a good thing because what nation is so Paramount intro play Nocturne make it much more difficult situations are in it also is disabling teleport from coming through Kodi source of responses that are text via media in Pro player no longer able to beat though so I think Nocturne really does have a lot of power in that regard. Irene good be sad to see the wrecks band away and we will have to wait another game at least if he's growing up the way it again now what's the jungle picked up yours if you don't grab a stolo even if it's going to be seen by a hundred thieves think we're going to play for teens by Travis it is how they won the previous game they came back with Team part of a team fight I would think we would at least I'm probably coming through for contracted popular pic of all the bear as much of an opera is it is actually does work well into Zach the slingshot with the roar so if you wanted to go for it would be cool but don't think we're going to get it gragas another one that does work here you connect me to the body's lamp to interrupt that slingshot also is going to have some pretty powerful for the game yanking and is it going to be in the Kent going to pull around back in there so Hunter get a blind pick a top laner and Rise seems to be the hover right now will pick up go get a guarantee but that would work or something like it like a budo pick your actually think no weed that we never see it thanks against kamado damn it typed on the top of the map the top laners Midler and the jungle are all going to do magic damage was Joe ridiculously resilient against that sort of style pics like that even now, I readily effective do Malachi's no troubles more it's going to be ribbon so and it certainly you can still go towards things like the extra credit and it building in that way you can get her Liebert read that can be very powerful Sunday running back to pick that certainly did not work in early out his for him at all and honestly General Perris have not been looking very good about playing 400 he's largely in part due to the fact that some are not working well together we saw it was somebody brought up the JC were constantly feeling there's one place yesterday as well we thought the same thing happening when I'll just playing MP4 as he's washing it to engage somebody is backing off that have not been on the same page at all of that is why I generally don't like scary fixed for them because you really do demand jungle present when your bike carrier a match if you get behind you can be worth through the case of contract versus and who's going to be in that lane fast enough as they expect rise for 7 to be pretty volatile here SS come up coaches shake hands probably only one who wanted a handshake is going to be okay here and we'll see how this one goes going to be exciting on here at battle between teams in the exact same spot in the squad there is room to grow you know if I can catch up with the top Echelon of the teams for the Elsia and well they are both tied in the standing of the last couple weeks before the golden Guardians they did have a very rough start for they are now for the three in there and their last seven have lost through some tough opponent so we'll see how they're going to look you're against hundred thieves who really was throwing yesterday against clutch sitting at last place in course we know that clocks are waiting right behind them in the standing of the picking up that winterle Iran and they are in that time for 6 place was one playoff spot up for grabs it and let's start picking up several more ways to catch up with black West and CLG and we are out of the rift now go to Gardens under thieves both these teams because you quite well coming into the year it's been a very slow start on both the sides it was seven games to play they can't spell makeup that and who he what is the first shot Snipes actually is little of his thing as it is to start vacuuming flovent and I miss you we got to be is actually taking that and he is still getting that first hit does always feel really good even though it's not the biggest of deals are the faster you get that medical Advanced active better you're going to feel as you start getting that consists of region very very quickly now watch this aggressive word come down I believe it was specifically spotted although gold is here waiting to see where the jungle actually start working down from contracts and it's easy to see how golden Guardians plays around the top of the map because I do kind of favor than I think in any early to vaduz I certainly rise plus gragas I think should have a pretty good time and it needs to be to get the doc is me fairly weak in the early level but that being said once that starts getting more points in a gelastic slingshot very difficult for women to actually a rather for the rise to push in on the Rhythm that can be attacking you from his angle that you're not necessarily evil toward out or expecting if you get on top of the rise postal 6 with ribbon for that that is going to be very very being stranded infant past this really laying here is the charges are used by Golden Gardens are the ones pushing an early on is and is doing a pretty safe clear so far his own jungle give me 30 Raptors very tender sub talismans it one of those comments. You can do on that go straight to read I will see where he likes to go from there I just need some Zac players just completely skipping going to stop at all and just trying to do a full clear because are they do field at Zacks dueling is still weak and if you get caught out and be very very dangerous but in Pro play you're off and seeing them going to try to avoid the dragons with the vision they have it on the map and probably going to go on doing phase Rush here on the rise and it's very easy to get just ew off on a Target and then tied away so we can do pretty well this one but it will not have liked that Aftershock tankiness food withstand a big chunk of births just a quick look over on that one it's contract is going to be taking a very unproductive fight for this coming Friday so many Pros do really like phase Russian general we're seeing even more of these days on Oriana has come out of because they feel that at this skill level having to move speed is just so valuable because they're so much better than your average player actually got going on still shot them and taking people down and just make more use of that added speed though it's not always as effective for a few players it can be very very good in Pro maybe getting pretty long now already missed of course cleanse here on the Victor but South Carolina and biscuit everything else to get this Zach going to bring the jungle to life and fight them both the same time for 20 may you be on the kit to Kiewit to both well and going to stay safe and not fighting about to go down this way and it didn't actually end up going for either of us cuddle so this is just him doing a full clear of his own side he's going to go down and see that that's goal isn't backed on go back to his wolves and it will be that sick can clear into a recall which I feel pretty good the longer the game goes and the Greeks have nice to be shown hadn't actually got enough any dank Zack just wants levels experience there is so critical for this Champion to increase the range of your elastic slingshot and all to have lower cooldowns on your abilities in general that level 3 gank is is usually pretty hard to pull off a electric ranges is so small Play Welcome to be the first recall there and gets bobby send her out of it I have to knock down the Walls as well so it's pretty easy stuff and we'll see you around to the jungle fairy looks like his contract walked in and I don't think he's ever quite seen Zack's can't know for sure can sit down I can surmise that everything that's got all this he's taking all fix the other one that's actually quite mistake right there and all that time spent means nothing nice for him but contracts bar and meanwhile I don't really have anything to do with till the crugs do come back up so I'm going to move again trying to get up perhaps a little bit of vision and he is actually listen to deal with a whiskey when your bit later is in base you're probably have to win the one we want to get the gragas will seem so he wants, collapsed charges up to eat able to walk right back out as long as you can save that one and he went out the body plan is going to be okay now it's right on the top side good damage out for some day but passed respect the fact that you can trade back in his own supposed to have HPV and Riven does not have a lot of health regen was going to be a long road back up as soon as the shield is down there from that initial trade you see that Hunter is able to get a really big birth back down but now and I just hope you're really to ask for that way then he doesn't want to allow a monster to read that way van it in a bad spot that he's showing up just in case bracket is there because Rufus pretty horrible when you're that far push-up Michael chunk right there has been put some shots for the deathly lot of mine do fairly close to Eeveelution are WhirlyBall in the end of it yet that's the bank already had you to tell Port went back. It's here graphic also looking to play this pretty passionately scale up and has not yet look Too Faced a dental you want to see someone like illusion using it early days trying to get a good item I think and believe this Lane and actually the delay FedEx Rolla bed and he's going to be going back now it's worth noting that is TP Lucien also which I think is fairly a typical we do generally see TV on on the Ezreal sit on things like Denver but I definitely have not been beaten nearly as much emotion and if you're doing it for a bunch of lame priorities but you can never get the back and it suddenly via had on the bush by getting that to your Shame by and then right back in Landen oh we'll see if I got to look at church because of this is certainly worse than the actual team fight is worse than the two tissues if there's an actual brawl this way. They won't lose me fun pretty interesting to know the concert does Alexa go lost chapter before his tear that is very rare to see from the rise player that this is more power immediately right so this is less about the scaling more about him trying to the bully someday and and Max of power of that early Caulfield by which is always going to be so good for Riven with that early CDR chicken pasta Shield runs away and now maybe almost at the trade it someday. Play Smashing it out misses the ultimate also missing the W son in a 21in hanser barely able to get away with his wife like that early Power by of the Lost chapter someday running late so far but both these guys have no TT and no flash so jumbled intervention could mean a lot because I don't tell bar pretty low but you got it in trailer brake coming through to Golden Gardens in that is certainly a payoff for playing or aggressive bottom line Lucian Alistair pushing the Ezreal and Brahman of the turret and they look at these especially when your job is going to be building a p your top laners going to be building a p this is not a couple of Tanks is not a sad one in a Scion F4 Champions all really care about them in front also one of them better, you can have it here milstein Audi Goldie just so slight towards hundred thieves and again sodakite the result when you got a compliment to Champion so I look at a pretty solid
are in the draft right now I'm going to keep it a secret to keep building versus the rematch right before you on your screen please take a look here getting right into Champion Select Renekton first Bic but it is an LVL beam so right oblique Lowe's dragon souls to the claims 40 minutes and it went back and forth with Genji did flame it may be jungler very kind with topside even if Ray's were up you would probably still go Billy. He also did first big Renekton for launching but I like the adjustment that they've made them while they do keep the confidencethere they ban Out The Illusionist I'm there blue side at a little bit more flexibility with them now they lock in double AP for themselves Lilia work super well with Renekton drunk Renekton Top Lane because you can put allow her to you on with some of those in bed we probably will get one of those level ones as well be so quick to answer the immediate volibear into the Renekton it love the way match up as well as the in Italy in to Lilia focus on the hard engage that's definitely something lb will lead you know because one of the big things that people always point out for an accident is the fall off later into the game and fall off his because he had a difficult time getting a priority Target do you have only a single targets done so you if you are unable to get that single Targets on an enemy carry then your usefulness in the T fight is far below a standard tank from the topside if you had something like a Leo not like a nautilus to get some easy hard engage onto that back linecan you store up some of the weaknesses that are always talked about for the champion and while I people don't like the early pics right now you seeing couple of bands to support she is gone away in Pirates of the Caribbean like a galley open tethering really hard enough of your players from before world or mostly drawing away from the pic so that could be metagame being left mid lengthall right if he goes for the classic all right I'm not too far away from now Mark and Ethan Fort for for lgd need to come through to be able to push through the mid-game near Pantheon I have absolutely love this Champion Force before it's it is going to be really really focused on early game for lgd the weather in Acton pick on the top side Pantheon on the bottom side with gin there's a lot of crowd control that you can use to set up kills to set up CC chain on your bring the Lily off of the efficient clear that you can bring into those Lanes to actually try and get killed and it means that we are very low engagement Genji side of skull much of a kite fat composition has beer Santa and not one good reliable start a team fight tool nothing remotely close to even throw up in sleep and obviously the pantheon certain things often even better so lgd have a lot more control over how the game take to completely different directions here for you guys are going to have the properties of Tompkins trying to avoid scenarios where is lgd they want to bring the fight to you get those killed pressure with Renekton counter with the combinations of gin and Pantheon see if they start anything out with the level 1 million billion kind of facing off on the top side of the map by the Raptor camp quite CD inventories we'll have to see one of the rooms. To see if there are we first left for them pretty standard ruins across-the-board though no surprises the only little caveat sometimes his ear will go with Haley weaker scaling ruin in favor of a better laning room I think lethal Tempo because of the Wave Control you can get by propping it off the Oriana and then pushing the wave is a really good choice plus the attack speed super useful for you later on to the game what do you want to get to of course not what you said earlier Kobe as you said no early invades we've got a heavy leave here for peanuts with red bumps not doing it going for the chickens and leasing. Rest of the Lakes Region of course doesn't need that much help does putting out a pretty heavy leash for Autos out of his Djinn down there so instead of Health which I don't think is a prop nobody is it is a choice you making V not touch the chicken through interesting as well doubled we first start for LBD really like it with a with a gin Pantheon laying their replies on kill pressure it brings up scenarios where you want to try and Bluff a lot and sent it to the early Sweet Berry uses it right there coming through and they have no early in Vape information on Peanut we're about it honestly changes your way match up a little bit because you are purposely denying this information while going to hear that that Millie drops use the available for the sun got the right before the flash easy follow easy Flats follow option for than everything else oh my God I feel so bad for peanut you just clip that last 10 seconds and you have a blooper reel of all-time heat flashes forward but your watch out sleep moves you forward on Lilia and so he overshoots it over the following Bears head straight back in a really fancy can I get to Landon and they trade blows back and forth. He wants an insult to injury peanut yeah clip bike after that sort of play you don't even deserve your own jungle peanut chases him out this is going to be our son does nothing at all easy Tower aggro drop and this game has gone from bad to worse and it's still happening like rooting the battle here against Mark to get some Auto pick up more volume down Campground will live but I'm afraid of the runaway guys are keeping going out to go holy moly freaky you better already start handing out your tilt proof Duloxetine care that happens in your laid and you are freaking out okay focus for lgd he's on the bottom side you see him trying to scavenge he knows that played already chased him out of the top watch where the map cannot return to this area which is very unfortunate for long thing as he's incredibly far behind on the Renekton now after those early shamanic but it is honestly does have to turn into everybody looking to fend for themselves to try and recover from that early game deficit going to have a field day. Pool priority ncdex toward they are bringing this is part of the Jungle we talked about early on keeping up the pressure peanut that wants to punish with Mark and just tell back right now the owners are all going to Mark thanks for the road buddy be able to clean up the top side of the map and that honestly is such a lifesaver for both peanut and long thing all the types of the map here for lgd it's still going to be a very difficult scenario but Mark is able to find a perfect timing window to run here on the pantheon has an impact tell me about this doing this to make a Joker fight did burn Smite on the chicken with me that's what his deal is it going out of you could do it easy pick up there but not want me to find some peace and still stand up. He's going to laugh at you completely fine to heal him to go right back and get the Hill from Rascal any blinds that you want to kill last call Ono Shockwave get the hate and she is going to call you for the extra speed does it have any extra damage to Philadelphia TV after you move the cue over to Aunt and bdd knows you can return to put the wave afterwards so he gets the last laugh in that little head straight there she a decent attempt but definitely going to come up short there would be had the extra juice pretty quickly for lgd mm 6 minutes that is rough enough to take so much effort to come back from this and get to see what happens in a second ago the dark side and tires came through it was started that one house I mean while on the bottom side this is the calm area of the map since Jenna's gone with the the new tech we're actually kind of liked it you know you start your boots and your bunch of health potions or exit fee for Jen Wheeler.. On some of the forecast through damage there but mainly it's for the extra potions or the subjects the saying that you get for the lame meanwhile ruler able to farm up in time for the purchase of the tier Placentia lox warts on his first back and gets to head right back Elaine I got to say son of Tok been chilling with no surprises everything is telegraphic Grizzly fare for it turns out he's got no help and they're going to drop off a throw-in Time Genji find another kill cops that I was hoping to see more pressure and we're gonna be so much focus on that early blooper reel from peanut at the topside freak that was just the most devastating thing that can happen to your lane as a top laner and yelled you can see him right now watching is just try to keep it together he's only level 5 to a level 7 volibear so they can go for those Dives and he doesn't have the extra help to come out but they've pulled off a swap you trying to get him out of the Lane Benton to the bottom side of the map bringing up ruler hey so I want to see if this can still be preferable for Rascal they can use them to get a lead or we stuck in a onesie to no longer for me against Kramer and Mark went to jail plays out right now Genji have sent to you like mid-length no fighting just yet securus.net for the Senate of a long story that is going to be most likely lethality opener can come to lunch with to go to Black Fever phrase correct building this one is the topping took me under Fire it may just play Jeff Burley swapping the first one to do the play they get to push them anyway first well in The Blind Side you can see that Rascal has a long thing at once again you're not getting away from the match up and it should be constant bullying you know he's gotten graston to the Conqueror of Renekton so there's actually no way that Renekton ever win the trade War 4 for the rest of this game honestly I had such an early lead you go in your short trade for volibear it's always trust the rejected if you don't get to stack up your conqueror maybe if Brad Pitt washing random was able to find if I can go somewhere else and get to a play the ruined King Sooper super quickly somehow you'll be able to have an answer but Rascals can discharge of his brass prop to go in for the sheen trade and there's really not a lot of function get to say about itself meanwhile suspended time stop stop side to get that very important early Richfield love this movie or where he can guarantee themselves make the trip plates and up to the counter jungling what temperature right now he's fight for that one Roth wants to be launching who don't know what to do about to put runaway devil wants her not strong physically pastors that got the night away from nekton the XP got froze the gold Gap roads going to look pretty good in this picture play number 345 to the under-fire topside almost dead as hell to sell all right don't DC let's see what kind of Miracle kind of recovery can't can we actually get up here because top side of the map is a possibility Kramer and Mark has can't eat a lot of people down but that's where Clint is going it's just such a smart move from Blades he knows that there's no way that Rascal actually get taken advantage of all the box at the Mapco used to rip out there that's okay aluminum fuel pressure a little bit of support I'm here for you I want this a legal age of accountability no flat shoes by Phoebe Ryan is David there either so she ate and peanut you find some purchase for themselves and for compensation of the mountain breaks and everyone moved around the way it did all the pressure was topside for Genji a big dick came through they strike top you strike somewhere else because I have three B1 is unlosable as we have seen so many times and then I found a pill to keep the gold within 2000 the golden termite has not moved about four minutes and another look at it Shockwave did hit their 48ddd was trying to trade back thinking that you can have a one-v-one but what's peanuts last in really like this
I was ready ready we are too and Zoe it's not it's not too surprising he has been a monster on the champion even when it's not showing up in the kills you have consistently been able to poke bowl out picture of the mutual objectives through that play and we were able to see that evening yesterday so I was because one is off as well wait to find out what to bring out but gaming I do hope for their sake still feel comfortable they feel confident they knew they had a very very good game yesterday against or the week or teams are still a good one for a while and you put that last 5 minutes out of your mind think maybe the guys are gone the way back up and Piggly can still feel comfortable no threat for hockey well that's not much of a surprise no stylist for the who need to mount a flagDan we did they cut a very good early game yesterday as as you're saying and if they were up 7 AK against hundred thieves but it was much more of what they did with the lady that was concerning for Fennville know they weren't able to actually Secure Care & Vision they never actually even attempted to Barron went ahead for a good 10 12 minutes then completely ended up throwing away that leaves so if we have these what question was like when they are there bats in is an aggressive team very proactive being one of these guys are on and see if they can get back to that and be able to clean up their late game of it and I think Kuni getting beat at your picture is going to really believe his actual best Champion right now he has been very successful on it. And Stage as well as His Highest winner in solo queue does we like to play a lot and it's a strong match up until almost every top cleaner to 1316 / all within a few because when she got nerve to heal faster to go over presently went down for like a hundred percent like 70which felt a little surprising and good to see her back and I think it's still a very very sparkly jumper on IG mentioning I think this point I can be a result of some of the more you know people are worried about them the Conqueror Champions that are getting buffed up cuz that could be concerned but galio Jarvan coming through very likely it is almost always going these days and for the Jardin is could be top or jungle we have anything in the other regions in toppling quite a bit before bringing out recently in the LEC a butt in North America that has primarily been a jongleur still absolutely wait to see what they want to do the flexibility is always nice one of the benefits of red spider that you can wait at the very very very end and move all of them around so as long as they don't they can always try to find themselves a good matchupstill wait to see Alistair has been locked in not a huge surprise there has been amply one of work is at most played since he became number 5 on a house there for him and I like the way you take for fudge especially because we know that big looking play it in their last when he played against golden Guardians the monster in that gave this could be flexed a multiple-lane and while I was saying that he is likely going to be playing the Casio really hard to know exactly where they breed a blue side draft Where The Red. Cannot actually tell what Lane the Champions are going and you lose a lot of the right side of integers is generally considered those kind of face and also worth noting here as we look through this is one of the very very rare games resolution is not on the draft at all Apollo one of those real or anything else they they could of course still flecked with the irelia grabs up I think it's pretty likely activox don't ban anymorebot laners if they can reliably predict piglet may play that opportunity later on the draft if you want to put it down the line it's like three big braids to carries Revolution and improved Aurelia and Matthew and the soul and the cat would be very feasible but it doesn't I think a lot of bands are coming out because that might be reasonable I do think that galio is one of those inflatable support so honestly and Lucien maybe the sort of Champions you do that Lucien plus the Alex are could fly pretty aggressively what you actually pack at galio yes he has Rose hard to get onto but you're so galio pics keep in mind we are seeing wrecks I still available and in what the Darvin. If they want to push the right nowand I get that anyway it's not going to look for looking to spend your right now by Ayo and Teo which makes me feel like Demonte maybe actually taking that Cassio because both LeBlanc as well as the Oriana attend to be free tough matchups for for there where you don't know where they are going to grab a draft that clutch of a fold-out but we'll have to see if they can actually execute on it because it does feel like one that needs to be aggressive you needs to be a head since you don't really have a lot of seating potential as you have no traditional Marksman is fairly short-range with the auto attacks that becomes difficult and if you get behind could look ugly butRicco's what's your top which is the biggest your counter for a Stacker 3 mashup like on a scale of 1 to 10 what is uric irelia and Cassiopeia in New York do I probably that's good you are going to get bullied early but if you can get to a cow and started working on your Triforce you can actually paid out the cash home because she's relatively low Mobility if you hit that you can win A-1 B-1 yeah so essentially lose it all stages generally York has the most Trouble With Champions who can ignore the cage and are very mobile hard to hit With Yuri because you cannot have that your Google not go on them in and out of your cage can use the Eon the ghouls to kill them as well irelia likewise with a Q dashing around Jeff do the same thing as to the Comfort level that these guys have on the Champions more than a match up that's what it feels like as well cuz I agree with you is Ice-T also magic should be so good and and yet it's not was being played right here if we had such numbers oninterest Sandra when doing so that was a blind Sandra puppy also in afterwards it'll be exciting in to watch for clutch Connect Four game 1 of the timer for this one as you say if the month they had the answer and pick his actually elected to which I cannot remember the last time I saw this it doesn't make sense that you're going to be bullied early with that similar to how people use it on Cassian Andor collie to sustained through somebody's early matches that they feel they're going to win later on about that being said, car has been so strong for so long on yacht so that you almost exclusively see that Keystone so Demonte definitely taking a more defensive approach going exhaust take you sleep just trying to survive the early game andI'm getting really interested to track how that top line goes because if Kathy was left alone in isolation and is consistently hitting those huge can certainly believe York for the same time Casio generally has to push to really believe about the Champions and then you're exposing yourself to the G4 plus your combo and if you're able to kill off that Cassio get the ark head but you could look pretty good team definitely could I think about how the Champions interact as well there's nothing the Cassiopeia can do that really stops the crocodile or movement of either Solo or Panda a can stop the driving up because delete you through it so you can't even tie me the flag of dragon the early levels and you can certainly I think find some gangster we'll see what happened we are going to be playing Red Ball 4 drag is not a ton of the champion for him he was spotted out by that word that was dropped on Raptor so they did actually know I believe that he walked by and just bought that out so they're trying to trying to have a deformity keepass perhaps do not actgetting released but they can be spotted you can see panda is a lot after on the pier he's already working on the drugs while lira is still on his first camp and it's going to be a bit behind the face at me and see if course the little ones all been split apart now in a company has a cool-down you can knock on a bunch of these attacks easy clear on that camping on the rap to see I definitely pacing Advantage here for the Darvin we'll see how that pays off overtime for now this driving is out of man that can be considered a certain point if you can't get the blubaugh for a kill of scuttle crab to get your man to pull back up and with that foot actually he's not going to get spotted that much faster and he may be able to go to we'll see if they actually want to try to backtrack over and go for that I've been looks like you will just be going for the blue buff yeah Tony has the pussy just like the fact that Phoenix was subbing they're just going to stay on that.what is the risk your path view path back to topside and you can't get that settled then certainly you're putting yourself behind different word right there standing over is that I believe would have spotted so look through or sorry I can't come through if I remember correctly either way lyrics the right call get stop side Scuttle they've taken so far pretty similar camps and we're okay as you mention he does have that pushed off lanus plus ACS now so far being pushed by the Overland how much was surprised of course he's really on we'll see if that turns around later yeah you know much more about all living as a marksman Lane in the throat of melee matchups you are free happy to farm and it could have tried to keep them pushed in you don't necessarily want to take the island lights and do for rally announced our that's more what it's about it's about setting up for either Lira to come down with a predator gank or just winning an all-in to be to yourselves and they do have ignite plus plan for any potential taught that can come through to peel off nailit's okay if you're able to find anything later on and right now it's Plus 4cs for Apollo's how much the has been dropped by piglet as the first of coming through as that Lynn had reset so moderate to small leave for the Ezreal so far at the dodging she was with kleptomancy as well they are the Raptors are gone I've been unlucky is down a camp and have to take the recall so pretty slow early stages you're no one doing too too much with panda is going to be up at Camp off that and we feeling pretty good about it then see how well honey can actually dogs easier because that is really what's going with this match-up is about hitting the morning mess with your queen you some of the ghouls you hit that that gets so much damage down on the couch and I can't even see that this job and is heading topside might be just for the crugs is paying it now but the boss really began can certainly hear he's within Arm's Reach definitely could be looking for that and he is it's a lot about actually being able to hit your to get the movement speed from that Proctor phase Rush try to dodge out on the Morning Mist try to dodge out on the flag and dragon that's kind of how you survived those sorts of place of a thoroughly Mana can be a pretty big issue for Casio in the early stages before you grab me or lust after your cheer or even your Catalyst depending on what you're trying to go for here finds a stump naturally relieve for a bit. Comes through things are the five goal no harm no foul here but now volcanoes that with bwn Aftershock down it's pretty easy to go from aggressive light so Xbox one gets it back a little bit to reset so he's actually much lower on power right now in also had a man on a recall right here feeling pretty good I think about how those of early stages are going I do think it could be pretty difficult to actually get onto Apollo if you're getting close later gamesages Israel is I think the safest Marksman it's fair to say is specially when you do have in your TT rebuild completed you of the seraphs shields sewing things like a nice form would be incredibly effective against all these low range and mei-li champions who want to try to get on top of you so Apollo will become very difficult to a sale in the later stages and we'll see if question really going to turn up the pace what they did yesterday. I think it only changes if there is some kind of like flash Rochester Linde gas will getting in for free and one shot 90% hell that seems unlikely through a nice boring out in the field and also if there's exhaust on the on the Galileo write this is not ignite you feel with the Justice punch is ultimately certainly there are opportunities on both sides but I really do feel like if you're on the side of you probably want to be a fling in a little bit more aggressive unless they're happy going into something like a 1-3-1 later on where you put your rally on the ISO on the sidelines and use try to playoff game like that let me see the first couple recalls come through Taco Bell boots of speed comes to take the topside Squires Bloom but doesn't do much for that there was no play to be had in that little 6 anyway so diving is going to be the difficult with the little extra time that was given over big with you to grab his Gene come back to Lane has not dropped too much farm and he has to go so far as staying safe is now panting I could box I have is not bullying this out of New York is feeling Douglas Regal Midland flight leave for Phoenix in the overall game is like a box that had cut them into doing a small part of that and I think her solo you don't really want to go anywhere beyond the cowl I think completing safe so afraid of flash for flash of looking with the hextech flash caption on the flash list jungler here and Alistar is going to be 6 very soon is pretty hard to actually punished for this so
can I become the the player we look at now is a he's an innovator he's flying kind of whatever he wants like he has one of the only playlist wins and definitely showing that they have style and plus I'm kind of getting on on the other side I think you certainly it felt like they had found their brought it in the house they want to play which is very clearly. Thank you and then you have the powerful carry in the middle and in the bottom line is that is kind of the salad at the Dalton where they had found almost all of their win when they have strayed from that they have not really been getting any win the three of their for Windsor with Sion the other is with her got all playing that sort of file I do think that's a job in that we saw darshan bring out yesterday and fit that style is well and he was waiting quite effectively against Broken Blade in a bad matchup so maybe we'll get another shot at seeing darshan on that picmeanwhile the tried-and-true biofrost Tom Kent will not be allowed here is got five plays at other Windsor on that champion imagine this last game as he is certainly it's a viable option here but it will be CLG also continue the trend of Andalusian even though it did not win earlier today if I do a certain point if something has her over band but it's offline and Instagrams and then you're bending it not even because you're you know it was wrong anymore because you haven't full and you have a right to your no longer sure exactly how to play against it or one that says do what I'm doing but I think I make a lot of sense when Force the LG content Azrael combo has been so effective revealed you as well in that late-game really picked it was Untouchable with that and they are going to break out in early galio the certainly could be thisportugalia that we talked about yesterday really get to see anything from it because the lane face went so bad but this is a trend. Clean to go to the ER got but as in almost all York matchup that just depends on how many times you actually connecting with Yorkie you need to focus on getting fools out when you're fools are out Champions can fight you if you're able to connect with that then you can go in and continue the trade-in to try to get pretty aggressive and this can get more and more your favorite especially post this when you have the ultimate because the first effective on the air. Dash can't go over walls he's downright XO so there is some decent stuff that you forgot has the dad does not Escape things like that would have come out later on a draft for the Yorkand first one always Target itself is wrapped up as he probably picked down there with Lucien and Ezreal off the table we have free sneaky and slick back in the draft so just yet but again this is a champion the candy apple Eton Lane at 10 to have a very weak laning phase are we having a lot of sport utility base text in the support role for they tend to be very effective in 2 weeks Landing opponents then we'll go to that when they do with a stipper might be kind of hand thank you for farm for my instinct is to respect me wrong that file Frost Gallia will notyou'll haunt you can react almost every single spell Galileo. It's not too bad just going to play it but it's 9 we go to the second round of or did they second phase of Vans and LeBlanc has banned by Theo James Bowie Band by Cloud Nine starting some of the state line pics I didn't make a lot of sense you're going to force me to ask you to try to show his hand and then very likely if he giving power people counterpick see where they want to try to go with that quirky is available we did just see that come out and I think it is a very reasonable blind think that's going to seem that is very physical damage heavy right now with your. And it's never expect you to be magic damage but obviously Gophers Oriana or even at Sindra those are both available within fairly safemiss that are being removed way here or not you're supposed to be some galio delivery right now coz can't pick up an octopus jar but he's still up that Urich still put the Jarvan top play for some reason either way you can put carbon jungle obviously desperate acts like a Corky Med for even you know that also works pretty well with the people in the cave I know it's very easy to hate your knocked up out of that was certainly someone who could help to try to put your head I do think in general anytime you're playing York I think a lot of your game plan to do revolving around enable in New York because it's Champion is so strong from ahead if you can get access to toilets if you can win Monday one survival and we do stuff you really can start to take over a game and knocked down her so incredibly fast and went behind Goreis an abysmal Fang fighter and I'm not sure if that is going to be the call but certainly there is par for fuel weed to pick what he wants because he doesn't necessarily know for sure where is he going to go well it's going to give us our sobrero here with an oriental pick up and it works well with their right you know Jarvis a going in with you or your combo off of that this feels like it a lot of fizzy mix a lot of things together yet essentially the Jarvan and the galley of both as far as hard and gays but also the galley of can get out and help the door can the Garmin gank they're very well you have strong engage of scaling in the form of the time for the team fight and stuff but if you can get people for thismake internally Turn Around by itself actually worse I get to whatever you're hitting them assume that follows you around this place they had like a fox. Furley are in the feet is in their hands so far over last year's lackluster run to the ALCS there is certainly light at the end of the tunnel can be very very good season of ornaments drawing it and we have some fun, coming in for us as well Nifty reprising his role on Silas a jumping into that you were going to play take take take with Drew Carey's. We wanted to see and they're doing it here we are see on the side of Cena and how much space would you be able to trade for a sleepy because it's actually triple Aftershock plus there's the Top Lane so these are a lot of Pinkie members here 49ers should be able to create a lot of space for sneaking a deal damage on the Severn that is one of the things that I have felt like sometimes we actually saw 6 a.m. have any trace of a game as well situations where the Timbers at be quite fed but can never get enough damage because they didn't have the safety and a space being created by that front line in is purple after. Members and their graphs determine vehicle who who is playing today I couldn't quite hear thank you coz on the wrist ladies and gentlemen and we've got our push in the mid lane is Pee-wee takes over a brush no word comes down and it still lives we don't cheer for that one should I do I'm sorry I'm sorry forget I said anything about drink 4 words please don't do it meanwhile as we wait for the players to get on the wrist keep mine to have lies off the rift as well after match today Wiggly and darshan be joining me and Kobe on LCS food on a new game show that test darshan Singh Powersports he's really good he is really good you got a YouTube channel covers yep definitely going to be watching what Tritton is feeling really big damage that was a nice start after socks cheap alignments killshot Elaine's eat pretty easy you should be able to pretty reliably Proctor that this is never said we should you really want to be in this New York if you Felicia your phone it doesn't because you really want to have access to the wave to try to get as many graves out as possible I want to take a lot of Frozen movie on his number one Champion I'm making the mistake of his is actually utilizing you're cute too often for trading and not often enough for last hitting for the graves because really your power is all around those schools you are pretty garbage without them that you are very very powerful with themself prioritizing last setting that allows you to be in a position where you can actually fight back fighting back to Scuttle crab can't and wow just spent staring just beating up the fence with animals it's like world quarterfinals all over again shattering spree with me is the first on the treadmill hate me I have no response to that you shouldn't. It's always a really nice early by we can grab Dark Souls tattoo when you are starting corrupting and they're being able to get the added benefit from that increasing the healing you're getting back and early power so utterly base he's not going to miss out on too much and certainly I think he's he's looking to hope they give for 7 to see Stevie but if you have more than halfway there that he shouldn't have to use it here are some decent you want to check in that Top Line is actually the only two CS tracker but you can see darshan. About 10 is so for the liquor supposed to going really really well and that extra pressure is certainly mattering he's got the potion still. Combat pushed out of Lane but he is strictly down ACS it feels like he's trying to hold the wave by his first because he's not actually three graves right there he's not bringing those out so it does lead me to believe he's trying to hold it here for a gank otherwise it is Miss play because it is quite easy. Can we get most of that farm in and compete for that a lot more heavily when you do have the tools out wave enforcer. Mason pushed to his opponent now though so actually fight this so often times Jarvis here and sit when he's not he's reclaiming back to the bottom side this would be an unanswered gank if we pulled the trigger there's a war right now licorice is backing up and he knows he's on condition not be able to try to go for that so now we will likely see him try to read that the way above their and see how this massive really does go because liquor certainly has been doing so much raised from the entire Community from the other top-liners in the league and from the broadcast as well most people again as the number one top laner himself coming out and say he thinks he's the best player in the league right now and you're putting your son of the Edition where he really needs to have a good game and needs to be doing well on this number one player for CLG to likely win all right welfare sean gets the way switch without getting game that's always a tricky one when you like okay I have to walk past the river as make sure I can survive it in about + 7 is a wave resets one more time spent staring for this rake in last 5 minutes so pretty solid however you get the chance of pressure you can see Oriana and jarvin waiting in the wings and saying you can't take this as yet and I think it's important to test right you know this is something that you really can't afford to give over that early ocean Dragon at 5:30 I think is farina way better than any other dragon in the game is as such a huge impact on the remainder of the length of a good spell shield. Liners nice attempt by the board as benign get that better rabbit both have the Q as well delivering pizza straight to your door I can only think about sneaky cosplay whenever he's working to bring the skin that's just a sneaky cosplay skit yeah if he needed any time to apply Gatsby in Lanez proud that was my internal monologue that was different that's good I like this crap yeah thanks all right we're taking application comes in he's got his army now you going to be the reason to push down and around tooth darshan mechanics can he keep the made into live up with healthy connections he'll back Us in the well also
back to being scary and we've had Lira BB all LCS jungler piglet been the best 80 carrying the war before who needs but it has not been West before like these are all players they can get back that level all able to do so at the same time they would be fearsome indeed recipe more about who is mechanically but it has been decision-making I think more than the individual abilities that is often question even when he puts himself in a good position some nights over-reaching feeling like you need to make something happen far superior to your party is going to be easily funny this will be the fourth difference between line up here for optic gaming vs. With the against would have intended or LCS whatever bottom line of Arrow and big together I want to see how competitive this side of the roster look Ciara's in the crown has been the one player to start every single game for optic so far this year and get another time and it isis Darla Kitten video seven rdr2 thoroughly different jungler start-off people look at as this guy who's really really aggressive who is more A hot or cold where is media is kind of more of the guy who's going to play for consistency he's going to try play for Farm Play Around Mission Control is injected then and all of that sort of style so we'll see if having garlic in the line up here and get things going for them as I did think the crown book better in the first 2 weeks along side door. So that it's really one area it's not like things were working as a hundred percent spread across this entire year and for this past it's been a hundred percent battery we almost threw up earlier pick up a k i want to play more Majors I want to go in and play my photos not off meta style but but still a little bit unorthodox or noon their first going to be there right away and a j switch can't beat Area North America pop game certainly are expecting Lutheran bomb to be the bot Lane do I will do as you say it has been Far and Away considered the number one mark then I may have a bit of a plane of their own and how to answer at the fresh to come out we'll see if the Jason wanted to go bought or something along those lines to try to match power for power down on the bottom side but that's the other thing with splotches they had you have some guys who are really kind of known for their real estate was amazing from Vulcan baby huge place yesterday Casio is Goonies best champion in my opinion you guys are so good at and that is going to leave some of the generic power picked up as well as I am curious who is going to play the engagement who's going to play the front line onI think of their players I think it's a Monster High astranova he's usually gone the champagne look at all of your LeBlanc whatever but he's was on the galio so I don't discount him entirely but I don't feel like who needs a great Malachi and Vulcans on Bromley public defenses of the tanks here so who's going to start the flights to let clutch getting play hyper agarose a question I have asked a few days did actually involve a lot of Tanks play and there are still certainly play making tanks pictures of coffee right and I think things like that babe morphe it is styled I was I am back yesterday playing something that was fine we can go this kind of tank PVP builds and I think you can build a similar role but we'll see who is going to fill that role in know it looks to me like much is trying to fade out a Scion pick from dhokla I maybe know when you do see that there is a double top of them bands like that and sign is going to continuously off the band page but it could just be that Jason's going shopping and so is midazolamthey're already decided we have to wait and see if it's going to be flexed around. I can pick her jungler is singing this next round and simply wait to flex that Jade between arrow and do close to Rolesville going to go for here there's the Astro van is waiting to see cuz I think clearly have the makings of a pokestop hero session bring you out Jason Zoe all to get along great folk so as real cannot round that out here so he said it will be here right away I don't need to rush this one because I think it's worthwhile to pretend Jace might not go Top Lane and just give Hoon easy guarantee counterfeit it is it is weird and what you are doing that but the reason that I definitely think there is for a pic like this in his order it simply using OK daughter has a very not there to pick where you had to pick that is contingent on what else the other team is going to play okay if you were supposed to fix them in Durango rightknowing you are looking at it like that but it does give up the idea of having any potential counterpick on the other side and in a situation where if you pick red side of your existence are you get no counterpick and you're special Jungle Book doesn't get to come out while then you just had to drop this today that you exactly it is pretty well and I do like what's the most engaged and we already know. I feel like now is dark does not bring out some sort of Magic images jumper than malphite has such a good time up in the Top Lane because you're if you're itemizing again if you want to Stack Armour Academyhardest counter picks possible in the Vladimir about coming out there really really smart booty clearly by okay well now it's for sure the J so I do think that they were able that I really outsmart them blasting again at another time cuz now not only do you have a physical damage juggler as well as the magic damage your booty is going to have to be in this is such a miserable match of this is really truly one of the worst magic tickets play it feels like in Top Lane at least do for a kaolin I can be very very tough to deal with the vitamere who could you to do things like that do Vladimir and sit there and farm off you can rescue very easily under the turret you become pretty dependent on Jungle assistance innocturnes not exactly the guy to get up there and really punishing Vladimir in the early but we'll see if I can turn around somehow Clutch Gaming a very very bad matchup in the top lyrics jungle Jase when he played a couple weeks ago himself and this one is optic gaming AR-15 parts do happen that can be scary they can get pushed through Lucian Mike to have a field day mouth light has a lot of good targets are all things be concerned about as we load into the game as optic try to find a light app that works there was a way from being tied for playoff position and Clutch Gaming are those exact same shoes even the bottom of table have a Fighting Chance of the LCS here to pick up a winvery stink bombs I do think that clutch has a much more straightforward and easy to run cough mouth boy prices are knock their prices are you go forward 15 fight where is on the side of a Zoe and Jace has to be poking and in trying to whittle people down and then maybe there comes to follow up where do Cole and tries to get a flakka and hard engage with the bladimir himself and try to do something like that but as far as straight up by B5 both you smashing into each other you really have to pay plush might be the case but we have an inside word we've got at word withpoutine on the sidelines for what do you think about this game is going to look like things guys can we see that you stopped in. Off for media's today what was the decision behind that lot of different options for the team in draft and engaging in two functions of Jays play today so I feel is just a different set of options and I think that it would be easier for us to use a different selection sports day is this game and this is something maybe we can see it more in the future or excited to see you back to you guysfelt different options the reason I bring this one end and certainly I would say the biggest Edge Optics you have ours that Flex pic with Vladimir into a very free Match app where you could maybe take over the game dhokla back when he played in academy I had just absolutely absurd Lee good laning phase Terry stats high damage share and feels like high damage is going to need you the name of the game here in this one and I'll fight with no tanks versus hard engage he did actually a little bit but then our customers card code on the first wave it's not really possible to make you late much to do here is it make sure this way but not frozen on him you'd rather be kind of thinking it's in a safe area and he's hoping that this means he's not exposed to any pencil. We know that butTony obviously does not and we will let you know as soon as we find out what this pause is going to be but certainly some very interesting match-up you're across the board as you stay Lucien has not gone through all this patch in the ALCS so first time Lucian is going to be able to come out malphite we did see as an answer actually from solo I do believe into the dates match up to who tried to recreate the magically had their butt often has had a very clever draft really clever is just a matter of it working out in the end it's just it's going to be I feel like the name of the game we're going to bring this game is there are compositional elements on a v e v level that favor one side and cons of elements on a One V one side that really favor the other like the lighter malphite is going to be a few wedge in this game that the game people eat tilt over however it's not consider mouth virus no tanksomeone's going to die when those are buttons are pressed in and it's well if malphite can just be stuck in the filing because do flies pressure interest constantly and enjoy quotes about pressure that you can't just give this away then I'll take him because he's depending stressful time, where's the new away for a Syma Neko Chan I think that is something that we're kind of seen you that you're worth currently Lee McIntosh said was really happy we prioritize but you would still kind of favorite Lucian Brom in the bottling TV to middling match everything is fairly skilled base so we will see us. I'll keep looking for an early baby but Lyra is going to find him and crowds trying to put this in so early flight for Dominic means it's too easy to take over that Day crafts for the Restless phones get taken and pay most of the gold goes to do. But have TX Pecos to Lira and I both last night for it I still can't hate too much they stillmore camps to pick for the Jason the end of it all feels bad to Smite for nothing. But it could have obviously been better for him but just wasn't expecting Lira to be there clearly that is why you generally only want to hear him unless he's really know where the jungler is or there's some kind of Star Trek movie clearing his way back up to the top side and we'll be able to get into Billy Bass on and then we'll decide to be there cuz I think he's expecting him topside take my camps away and it lyrics to The Folk of your left hand side and came down and maybe surprise him either way though it is still more camps for the Jays long-term and it feels pretty good if not urine is delayed to 6 because he only got half his Raptors that's Solid Rock the gaming that's that's the power spike your kind of a lion and because of six more actors going away it has been nice hope your day was good damage one more shot but it's all black byinteresting because Jason's not exactly an early-game ganking jungler either right no Nocturne op time to talk about okay we got to shut this guy down going to make something happen before you text you want to talk to be proactive but it does not really that it is still kind of a Skilling jungler as well as someone who's been wanted her to Villa Smite him she was going to try to look to play around pressure round dektas and and you hope that he does have because Gangstar really not that interested in looking kind of just get behind someonewell so far stiffer three calls coming through both these players. A couple longsword for his efforts and libras Nocturne sitting top 10 cases and kind of tank to be had is text on the ground for the First Response of his jungle the wise far for the course here pretty typical lethal Tempo high damage available to get the warranty one have you decided to do so is much more about the team fight you know it does have a lot of power there but a lot of reason that people love these were matches that you can just complete the farm gold off of the Mal fighting then you get your one two items much much quickly and then try to get to the G fight with that and utilize that as the power of this is a bit of a different style and it's also something where goonies never going to even have a chance of running you down because the only hope I I've ever really seen from outside in the one going to the smash-up is a q-max where you can just run him down but it was FaZe rug should be able to remove the queue slow and you can Simply Thai the house and not really any hope in the one the one you would think for honey but going to recall for an early Catalyst and likely working for the Bissell which I think is it a pretty solid answer I'm going to be decent for him and her little even spam man to get health back so should be able to survive at least somewhat one small chicken chicken away from. Gandhi attempted invaded by the timer about right but it was clear to go Me by Lera though level five is first woman doctor a good job of farming despite losing you know half a camp to invade the earlier and has really good at there any way we can live in the queue as well so I could be able to use down a lot of those camps is fairly quickly at level six. Should be able to get it and then look for his personal gag throwing down here already
no his champion pool is it to him but it works out well when he plays in comfortable on and I do think that I still feel like Golden Gardens can easily be a player one of those things I could take that playoff spot from another We Are The Champions by Queen can see there's no yasso allowed on the golden Guardian side what they wanted and actually play for themselves and the following one of those places. She had done well on Mages in the previous split is going to be a flex khaki the night away and Haku is no on the threat to himself bottom Lane even if you want to consider yasso Bottom Line tickets at pleaded play yesterday and then to support fan create typical stuff in the first round of bands are coming out from Echo Fox and golden Guardians will see what they want to go with the auto did not work out for them at all yesterday definitely was really struggling on that and Oleg getting out of prison for kids play there on the horn as well but they worthvery weak bottom line to be too and I think they're going to want to try to go back to something and maybe a bit more standard after that game for us to build back up the comforter store got up and it doesn't even pick it right away you can see the April 4th mcfreckle plus I with Lucien off the table or that is easily and by far the most highly prized champion in Pro flight and definitely having a very strong Lenny face as well as picking up a lot of pressure and you can't do a lot of damage yeah it's also very strong go over to the dragon helped us secure that we know closer he's very good at figuring injective sandhow they actually perform on it a lot of kill threat in these Coastal and also if you can get an early combo and starts backing up those two fewer sure it can be hard to kill off as real Brom you shouldn't lovely in pressurized mention he can swing in the lane when her support rooms away you were always going to get closer when you want it goes to me right away looking like they want to count to pick somewhere else and now it's Jarvan grab for Echo Fox week. Darshan play that top really we know can also obviously be a jongleur for us as well so that remains flexible neck of bauxite Guardians think it makes sense when you are red side you're hoping you can often counterfeit both solos it with your first pick in the last around as well as going to pick right here so they are going to grab the yard. But as you said we don't actually know if that is the top or jungle pick for Solo or rush because every possible for the flag that are so ridiculously popular these daysexactly get to properly matchups because they don't yet know where it's going and popularity a lot and some of the other reasons as a top laner is being played as it seems like for in recent weeks in the toppling dead in Jungle but I think it really can work you to go Stephanie Green Owl Midland fan going through is Oriana until you're both off the table you're being dropped out as he is continuing to rise and rise in popularity certainly a strong top laner Yeah Toast the driving to be jungle then date Phillies on the band for Golden Guardians they don't want to deal with any potential Yorick a couple targeted take taken away here from frog and but certainly there is the Olivia still available know he still does have a lot of other pics that he is really enjoyed it so she would not necessarily brought on stage yet like the Veigar like the luck to be excited to see him bringing out more of these you need except I want to lock it into audience Ramen to be great but alright Gleason is going to be a for sure where the job is going standby. Jarvan is going to the Jungle Sion top to match or it's going to be exciting just kidding stop yeah we will see at what frog want to grab here might be getting interesting fact I think the Corky is not only a good wine pay for itself is when we get frog in last time you did the else gets was playing a lot to prove it take away is there from Phoenix that is a good source of magic damage here for the Xbox line and stuff they have a very strong feeling too buddy cop would you looking over at their side a lot of Frontline with Sion Jarvan and Brom and then double Mark than one and bring the Magic game at 1 bring the physical damage are they should be feeling pretty good about that and likewise with the picture locked in it really is kind of team fighting cops that we have going up against each other a lot of engaged here from the golden Guardian Sodom Lane as well as obviously the Flemington Central they're out of lease in and I think that we could see them trying to pressure down a lot around the bottom Lane where were they should have it earlier than I feel like in my mind I slightly saver echo-fox dear I like spy on stealing a lot like Jarvis killing for sure more than least bin zanni flag is a plan of attack speed and you got a little bit of energy to bring it out here record-wise they are slightly favored over golden Guardians compromise I like them as well that's good to give you that run a rush and his team to win on Sunday after a loss on Saturday imma call you guys are going to break that streak here and it would be pretty impressive do so as they are on their last five matches than they have to make it at least one to get in the playoffs we'll see if they're going to be able to do it for me a roster for the golden Guardian so they have been getting stronger they have been feeling like they're actually finding their legs in this LPS season is starting to live a little bit more up to expectations people saw them as a playoff game definitely can be still if you have a few more games to play and make sure you're logged in to watch. LoL Esports in game contest Washington class today and look at that even a lower Third Watch. LoL Esports., case I'm not making enough sense or yourself some in-game content adjust for tuning in frogging Puerto Rican LCS spring split week 5 30-second something is fun. Not much my baseball all right well we got them out from the two teams and I do think the golden Guardians should have you at least bushing Lane top bushing Lane bought and I think that midlane is is more of a kind of a coin flip there I could go either way depending on who I'm going to be able to get the advantage in the Early Trades but but either way that should give contracts the early Edge in the jungle when you have Lain priority and multiple Lanes you should be able to be more aggressive you should be able to have more opportunity to try to attack your body down in the jungle I think there is a chance that Phoenix is Corky actually does get a LAN party long-term over frog and Victor because he's running teleport you can go super ham the first three or four waves and and just just burn your entire Health in manifold to try to get frog on the back foot in his to be key back in place with me footwork I feel like it's the same through so I would not be surprised by level six. Phoenix police belt clip push to push leave their first Dumbledore have to wait to see you but timer for 10 minutes early hex core upgrade that e gives you so much way of clearing know maybe you just don't actually fight Phoenix on that quirky but either way we are going to have a rush starting down on the bottom side he was leashed contract is going to be starting topside we'll see if he goes into vertical jungling likely is here on the bottom side so it will be a little careful yeah both are going to be doing the schedule and then it definitely seems like they could be looking to try to take away if their opponents Blues but that's more dangerous for rush because of golden Guardians potentially has a Fortune bottom line that's true if they can get back on to him when he goes for this but right now it feels like it's actually a box of gotten the early priority in your sing Tennessee at the three types of minions being shoved in so I thought she not easy for a way to leave and go try to stop to do if you can tell him by the Vino at all and empty have to see as though working out they spend the resources to push in that's doing okay so these can be equally traded Camp so far this time as well what's lady Pastor one Seidel vintage the same camp Beach other Yuengling text scenarios how many cancel you actually go for you can see so far that contractors not actually started up the walls and Rush has contacted looking for a gang Midwest and there's no he'll sober without using priority for him as well so the wave can be frozen against him and he'd have a lot to be back in the rushes here to this will be a Scooby-Doo or Hopsin I go I have some damage Rusty's one more spell summer ideal needs one more better for the golden Guardians because Phoenix uses TP to get back to Lane there the lane is frozen against him first Blood went to his Lane at ponen really good exchange there for the golden Guardians and we should be able to see frog and having a pretty significant Advantage off of that this is just really smart stuff so they already forced him out and based on the way the position he had actually TV back at those really nice for project heat flashes over rush to hit confirm the Q Rush reaction flash to block the queue for Phoenix but was not able to do it in time do contracts helps to get that damage down and does pick it up will be the advantage in the jungle for rush but certainly the solo Advantage should be dragons and temporarily Rush has yet to recall so he's actually horse on out of the fight is gold leaves not going to matter of time is not PVP stats, regardless and either way then go back to farming but there's a double line for there is the lead if he finally gets that push through and not rush maybe try to find his receipt can you mind it's now summer list on both midlane Corky if he has natural escapes Victor does not a brush aim the EQ well he will for sure confirm CC in a frog in that picture can be killed especially if he is pushing to me have to watch for award I don't believe I saw a rush for the Russian word go down but now he's going to be potential to on one keep mine at Corky's not in the lane right now Sports Clips in Rainbow contract but now it's so low we going to push back monster in A1 vs to himself and has low but no gate coming through downtown right off that first game has ran straight over to Scuttle there and actually just takes out contracts broaden was busy trying to shop and the golden Guardian soul in his room. He was actually get over there and help out contracts and he gets taken down for a very easy kill hati actually been a bit more safe there look at it this yes lead already significant disadvantage for Phoenix going to get himself back into it a little bit more with that kill we are going to be fog in front of make good on his Advantage going down to the bottom Lane looking to punish slap nice entirely really nice the Midlands Orthopedics year it was still a pretty decent if you're going to be able to get the flash they're out of the follow the will get the teleport out here also and I definitely in ale should be able to get a decent reset the here is the play one more time of the interruption on the Warhawk there's a contract decides to just try to run back the other way towards his mid laner knowing that he could get the assistance there I've been as Russia's going up towards that lopsided in Phoenix wasn't actually tracked didn't realize that he could be here contract was thinking okay great we pushed out one guy in a frog is going to be able to come up I can grab this subtle but instead it isn't Ezekiel find a way of Phoenix it's just me and tries to grab this way it'll be 4252 everything will and he's going to get away from this one that's enough for the walk has to be stopped en Phoenix will drop one more time for 14 seconds later Apollo and hack modem in Land O Lakes does not have spells to more Autos it'll be a stunning this shirt kill a pencil and a cubit Contracting nearby cut pork chops come in and they will not save him only 600 thank you you're willing to make that trade as are you are putting that Corky down even more what is a great response from Jaco tping and being able to answer that getting to kill over onto his drill a special is going to feel good there and I can have no man I said they couldn't actually really fight back in that circumstances it's a good setup you can see that they're they're playing it very patiently await is not wasted, or lie on the gravity field is really well place you do the fortunate to have flashed so when that hits the Sun away is always going to be able to follow up they do get the kill but Apollo has made the Rome and the TP come inform hawkwell flash que hora llegas tag Providence out of mana and easy chase down for the tracheal wasted a lot of time in Casio Valkyrie the first time around you kind of let only get closer than I needed to do and maybe you would have loved to be passed out spell bit earlier either way though it's just a tour and now and Golden Garden go for a deep board or spot and get back out flu is traffic to Corky and we have a nicely he's got that augment and yeah it's an 800 goals lead a feeling released all he got through that way to get the first 2 augments on Victor and now he's just online when you got to get an upgraded is first base thanks to that first was certainly things are looking good for us we do see multiple members from both sides on this dragon head but he's not here yet they should just finished
but the odds are I'm going 0-16 on Saturday and then 1501 Sunday is 1 and 30 mm but he's done it so far so if we Saturday but yeah if you lose on Saturday he is never lost on Sunday I predict we'll see if it remains true throughout the year is an exciting one though it is teams that are tied in playoff position right now at 3 and 4 when put you up about that cuz as we near the end of the first round robin nine games for the first year for the back half year was We have no trash out loud rock and roll Taco know in this one know what I got for Sunday even talked about in that thought you was talking about me laughing Taco is so effective on the champion and because I do foxes have the most expensive playing through their bottom line of them getting advantages and really being a very very strong for the team epic it makes a lot of sense at Targettake away the Azrael take away the trash so food safety is gone now I think for the fuck to get removed as well certainly full of strong Champion we've already seen bang play and made the bottling before wouldn't feed the price to get in no caste as well pretty funds left over all wrong one to fly to have seen that you wouldn't normally pay it but I move seen it falling we seen it pop fit and jumbled so you do have to at least give that credit to it is a 4-way Flex yeah it's Apollo himself please play the following Jace already we've seen her from fellow as well so fun if you first Jets game of the year for certainly a lot of strong and players for this one with brought up the table. Go get to Alistair instead as I really do like the variety of play you can get out of Champions like Alice or you can be the heart of a champion also few things away if you want to play more for back of mine certainly the graveyeah. That is certainly the most likely and with how well somebody has been playing of late I think it would make sense but give him to carry if he can take an advantageous match up off the top of a moldy if echo-fox is going to walk in there other solar later in this first round or try to save that for last fix as they are red side encountering really is the major events there and speaking of that keep in mind that these first pick for Sunday and it was pretty obvious for the beginning of the draft and it was a Viper who's up at 10 to pick up with ribbon and actually took over the math help take over the game so somebody asking you to be able to either keep that Jace flexible or be really sure of it so it has not signed a counter going to have to ask games in a row here for bang probably not as likely be killed but against the same song catch a spotlight you got Global movement you got engaged rule for these days or seeing a lot of things troubles actually closedgames about multiple forms of engage if dates is going to be one of your soldiers to your not getting teeth are Tompkins certainly isn't bringing that either so bringing in the ass is going to give you that additional forms engage in the Comcast can really help to keep this guy safe against both the Alice are engaged as well as sleepy Bubble Toes. Spare Lee mirror Champions we could put that Jason family as though we and we really expecting to be playing at there in the midst side and since I do consider someday playing stop playing jazz pretty likely in early and Soul band comes out and they might have another one who he as well or this art pictures of jungle pool as we were really only down one jungri just an option band everything else is available and not the only one that seems to be getting a lot of band in the first round these days people still feeling like the ultimate is so incredibly powerful us shutting down not only teleport with really making those device very chaotic for your opponentthe band does a novelette is Belfield to Flying J stop as well a little bit more here but it's just in general too strong band yeah it worked all over who is the guy who doesn't mind that I think it would even fit the complex that box is going towards a little bit here Sybaris typically 18 Spyder you want probably 210 to the grounds that a team fight comp really well and and you have that beef walls there was an output in same DPS more than a show remorse come over when you get rid of where the stamps come back through see if they're worried at all about any of Russia's Champions is not from performing as well this year so may not get targeted but if you want to shut them down at least indirectly an option that is going to be the final band I do think that's what he also make a lot of sense as a fan because there's not any through Frontline yet on the hundred Seaside jungle is one of the areas that they could be bringing that indo you want a date with people are building that full HD these days if you wanted to go more with your tank option you could be looking at something like his back which we just become out yesterday. But really most of the other end game style junglers are not paying that are being play these days people are building Jarvan Warrior into maybe pseudo sang be so fun of them into your I do love Jarvis and Ultron jungle pick keep mine the he gives more taxi dispatch them before so just put in the flag down is going to get more DPS over to follow them in the bottom line and he is going to be playing that engage Dumber most likely have seen on top somebody feels like he's a full-time jungle now going to be the sort of kind of pick you up for an do who does a fuse look like they're pushing Lanes almost everywhere I think Ashford liver is a bit more content but otherwise looking like a lot of early pressure and they can take over Punta the early game lissandra will still come through as welllophophore momentum a little squishy Epix On fentanyl off can be killed but I certainly have been looking at it through the window of kind of having two forms of engage you really do want to have that feel life is not much of an initiator in the later stages yes you can take them down if they're isolated out but you don't want to be starting off a fight UniFi B5 running straight in-and-out site is actually quite effective against jcr this is a smartpick and there's a tremendous amount of physical damage on the other thing you can say about that is not a tank filler so generally speaking what then stacking armor is going to be enough for the lysandra to be dissuaded from targeting this mouth if he wants to build for the match of expected expected to go, and you can trade quite effectively with adjacent to the Jason's not get a very big lead in the early stagesMilford stops caring about your damage and then post it it is incredibly scary to push whatsoever because Mal flight plus G4 can absolutely blow up a Chase you've got a black Dodge you're dead otherwise it would be very excited when I'm happy to see if I come through this I think so far of the year we are seeing so many different things come out the first time you are free to pick those out quite as much here supposed to be exciting I'm looking forward to this conclusion of Camp select what happens on the rift hear malphite certainly exciting top winner and it's going to be a lot of fun it's pretty straightforward pretty sure it's actually going to perform in this game and I do think that there is room for this Birthday meme when people are going 80 heavy cops about his bunch of these is one of those solo queue Champions as maintained a fairly High win rate as a tank and it is going to be Comet malphite going up against themgoing flat do in summer league matches what we are getting ourselves they're on the cusp of playoffs in the first round robin the group stage someday on a first pick Jace to fight against the mostly physical damage. Think of me really just to make a lot of sense here he does have to be worried if he stacking pure armor and OHP early game about any potential to hear also tracking that is going to be very important but rushing things like early Tabby's going into a Time fires going to make you so hard to take down for Rhonda and someday and I think that's the direction I'm expecting we have also seen quite a few players looking at so it's kind of similar to the hornbills that people are doing where they're actually getting a lot of individual CDR pieces and just trying to have that ultimate up as much as possible because that really is what your team fight revolves around my mouth right outside of his office is pretty worthless I've got a few tacos like I know where the time that's normally goes off on the wall wow alright hun has Bang couch that is a ward that died zombie words that's got you pretty cool and they're going to look for a potential Steel on this Red Bluff is brush going to be stuck taking a pretty lackluster Camp here but it's actually really I think you're from rush if you cannot win the toobydoo don't bother even confessed right so instead of hanging around and trying to maybe feel it or for trying to get to win a fight that you can't see his already finish this Camp he's going to be heading down to the bottom side and he eventually even go and take away some of his opponents Camp so he's not getting delayed very much here at all I think this is the intelligent response G+ Olaf is way better at level one there that's actually drop the rush hockey misses the knock up on subtle crab that is not break the shell does not knock down the extra bit of armor damage baq so that's why it will still be crushed stone I keep mine has no blew up and he went for the hunters machetes snowman reason on the stove off at all going to make the second half of your pretty rough but he's got full house will not that high in Sparta going to going down. Tuttle could have actually gone down and maybe take away one of his opponents can't because it is still going to leave on a plus-2 can assuming it's not rush a little later get to go counter to Blazing away and early damage their you do have to be so careful in those early levels the first recall a fairly important to be able to get a decent by there you thought I was just have to accept Okay I can't actually could test any of the wave until you're at the door and then you try to have by lwow farm disc is there going to be just barely jumps the way but I was last person to 410 and so was going to grab all of this farm this type of work you have been bad but he survives it so there's no way you try that after somebody takes a girl early and it's already taking the charge. You're not going to be able to actually finish them off so I handled it very well but certainly a really bought fly there a hundred. They're down two flashes they don't even kill the guy and it's even on Farm on the base so Soul has got to be the smiling about that one and Anna is down a camper because the time you spent up there's a flash with all of its chemical wash his feet again Michael Booth frontal actually flashing the to disguise their the jump in from Jason then the corrupting potion making it so somebody was going to take a car back to you at the flash out as well very poorly executed from the hundred thieves lots of pretty rough thing right here but it's like only for the squad as we can see if it works or farmed with your from klepto and a couple of spots than that but this is going to be huge knock-on effects of suddenly so look and feel very very safe he's able to take that for 3 called there's is a doran's ring to add to the Poke yeah I mean it's really big deal when you actually die dude I'd like that with the way stats at your turret the implications are huge because not only are you missing asmongold you coming back you can be down affordable level at times if you're going to be able to get back so that is incredibly scary and now so listing at level 5 years has the XP Advantage although it's going to be slighted someday we'll pick some of those up and brush it from top of that is a stupor easy killed yet so just that one play alone has really limited the amount of time that we can have to believe it it is a hard guarantee someday we'll be flash this Wednesday is sick he's not going to be 6 off this wave I don't think I'm going to take some time right now it's Rush is making sure that he's safe and cases arriba gang for Anda with how far up solo is certainly a to be one would have been a kill so smart passing even though it's not going to show much on the score line LOL confetti taking his farm he kind of just want to waste the effort and still be a very very early 02 Dragon this is very quick into the game with the pushing bottom and it's going to be at one of Lenny face resources here they are paying towards it's actually heading down to the dragon will see if he can be a 50/50 but he started kicking Spillman first what does Echo fox really nicely. Bacal Fox there it doesn't even get low enough that it has to be a 50/50 remove does pay them but it's worst flood and the dragon going the way of echo Fox there and that is such a big swing for the brush had an inkling that he could be over on this dragon in so far both legs feeling for Rhonda really right just ran straight here from Spawn it was getting pinged on the expected over on it. It doesn't have enough time to actually get into semi rain season is camp stove intelligently Rush doesn't bother fighting a dragon who he coming in your hat teleported and he was sensitive Behind Enemy Lines ask you to sell bulk the audit and not re-engaged aphromoo and bang it already use their blasted so that was a one way trip getting over an easy First Blood and using both of Summoners War
and the hotfix that disables a selfie from being good and Sorrel Lane is in here so who needs billion top is not going to be nearly as viable I don't think the sea. But we are also had a bunch of frost and it's not support take Farm until you turn it over pretty cool but either way we'll see what happens to your kind of logic gaming and clutch are in a Champions no lushen know as real as real first band we're going to see the bottom Lane Frost Bank I doubt unless we have Maids down there that's going to try and do it nobody else really gets as much use out of that strategy following up with a style band Clutch Gaming do not want any part of the ultimate feeling so like that which is no not really a superpower pick all together I'mare they trying to run some stuff like billions are some old intensive championships because that is a big denial right there if you don't want to play yourself or with your other games but you also don't want to block yourself it's also a bit of a slightly quizzical band he certainly around there's been one Jays game from Hootie so far but you don't expect to see that so early in the band list you expect maybe in Phase 2 when you start seeing more to fix down but there will see what that actually mean for them is Alastair picked up the available he wants that you can play something really insano backline like a drink or something but they're going to play nurse Scion. Finally back in the champion today go Premier tank even after the nurse so again the nurse for a little bit of damage Nerf to his Q cooldown reduction for his W so it's a little bit longer to activate the W nowadays place is a bit worse still gets extremely Spanky and that's what she'll do you want they want that ultimate from Saintand they want their Sean to be very very Tanki Frontline night unkillable one more pic and weekly is going to grab that undefeated Tonkin for biofrost so I have them back up there and if you think he's going to say hey let's beat you into it what kind of picture you here in this first phase the draft date that will happen but I agree they are very obvious front ends in fields such as what happenednever going to be the first Marksman picked up here in this game was it to Premier one kind of eliminated its pros I don't feel really strongly either way I think you want to have those items that have to build the one to I would skip this deal until third but I think it's fairly close to being them certainly that should damage is nice but if it is CDR 840 G3 really do like them at a return on Silver standing out every wave spamming out boomerang bladeCalvin Harris blame as well don't get that one wrong so that we can move around and this is a very very standard setup you want the busiest Freightliner in the game now they've got a team bike carrier Infinity Edge I still do like the runaan's style secondary for her and that's usually enough to get a reset and destroy the rest of the team fight yeah I would definitely have to have striven hurricane built in the build ship got bust in the update and it is only efficient and and very very high damage hurricane of course it's obviously both are great choices and and I think they're closed very very goodLacey Riverbend by means there's a possibility of power of people playing as 240 style bit later and them playing mainly around hyper carry against the rumble I feel that like that is a little bit more difficult because even if you talk to eats up the Jinx like that removes your team damage basically for for that duration and it's absolutely get-out-of-jail-free card I really do like what Clutch or put it together as well even though it's killed Jesus focus on super standard Frontline Plus the speed plus the AOE damage that could be very powerful for the early game Boulder Junction right here then we'll play hide and seek with youdo its picks a pick me up all of their really are aware that fix a has been their primary carry of course they're still a pic for Pua out there ready to go in the middle and we'll do the secretary might come through in the Middle Lane Wiki Waki nearby the way a lot of people super happy to get back on the court you train with the options of crystals coming through againtorqeedo does have a little bit of an issue with some assassin's rifling through a few options here we did see a dead earlier in a European LED no kassadin both recent Nerf armor Nerf black with a passive they can just leave the backlight trying to do if I was at least said I would for sure, kill power weed out early in this gay bi as an 80 jungler whenever I see a cat that it is so easy now those are some of the skews the lowlanders where I buy yes I can solo kill him with my warrior you're probably die and this is fun Clutch Gaming and counter logic gaming both just passed a game behind flyquest in third those these teams who really got sort of Shake It Up in the offseason keep my eyes peeled you miss playoffs the first time in Ord history switch to run a couple of players brought in their Academy jungler brought in Tower of evil and now they are poised to be tied for through with the wind right here such gaming lost most of their roster but they're only after a very disappointing summer split with famous play officer toys to have a winning record themselves alright this one's definitely means a lot or the middle of the standing here who's going to differentiate themselves to pack that's the back camera let's get ourselves in the game Clutch Gaming versus kind of logic gaming game 5 of the day all right let's be pretty standard openings from everybody now it's if you are looking to put out some early fresher all the mid lane which I think that Lira should should do I mean it's basically bottom triangle of the map usually has the jungler you look at the boats opposition's early on in the game and you can decide on which side you're going to favor heavily this one I think for Leroy act as a lot of options you know cuz you're talking about the rumble who needs Bison play aggressively we also know that who needs verse acceptable gangster at least has been for the last year so that's driving you to the top side but then again Shield use wind conditions are on the bottom triangle of the map + you want to kill this accident before his level six and it is very easy to do that as a as a leaf in super mobile does a lot damage to him so I'm very curious lyrics stop process as he goes through this game and this is one of those ones we have so many options piglet the minigun is on and he's out there and he's very very low health regen and so pick up the same as you're going to stick on him he's not even got Fleet footwork so it will take some time to get to help backup not that I think it's time to kill Lane is getting demolished in the health and Mana here if I miss laying with both of the early Boomerang Blade prop Ross going to trade as well in line right here but looks like he has dibs on which ones I first went off pretty good here comes the train I feel like she was as happy as we were about the trade Lira we talked about his objects Creak in this example I'm here look listen to the tribe Russian came down for coz they didn't see it coming. Nevermind nevermind alright now I can safely finish this even though you see me cuz I got to go drop that thing you do about it there's another look at you doing it all along he was baiting let's fix a get very good trades on him before he goes in Flash with Alistar easily Secours this one consider is that bottom land burned three Summers on the side of Clutch Gaming CLG recognize that they were dead in this situation they did not use any of their own Summoners there's a possibility of recourse here for the bottom lane or theology if they decide to have weekly finish up is frogs and then head to the bottom side of punish those who lack of Summer's Bells the power he will now getting the truck down about 1/2 HP Sauce to teleport if you need this to get back in later on down for CS is the first couple of waves coming through but The Runaways number 5 right now and I mean to almost perfect for Matt Demonte you be able to take the key with his own so trying to hold on to you before is his more eclectic champion pool I feel like he plays a lot of things other people don't doesn't always work but I really do love that he tries and I love these are very good I don't think I think it's always a chance in Pro play and so anyone who brings one out there for the first time in like a good I like this I like variety so your point on at least you tried I mean that is there at 1 I thought really could have work I threw through think there is still can work but that's one of the ones that you're talking about right outfits with a Chance nobody else had tried to play it has been very clear week is this in a picture into a car so I could exploit those very clear weaknesses or 1/2 minutes of course keep in mind darshan is on Scion throw a level 4 teleport and gets knocked down just a little six. Tulane you have pretty good up time on the farm but and there is him pushing towards the Adaptive Helm that read you be looking to eventually trying to grab as many or at least as you can escaping or teleport as long as you can and then using at first they get back and not miss any experience disco one-hit your level six that then you got to get back to your late round trip gas station, miss a day pass at a better one another with a double Summoners hero Advantage could easily go see Oggi's way we want spend enough to set up at first so that one's going to land pictures of damage to your house when you go to be careful what's going on we want to do I'm driving when you're in a one-v-one like that position yourself slightly inside the enemy model so when you're flagging away you're not just running away you also get the doc up there on your way out to the possibility of any Chase in your queue damages in case it anyway so decent stuff here but we have a game with a 900 Gold Leaf to clutch really on top in a Box locations of this Midtown 20cs as well so seal Jeff is right by the fact that they found a lot of losing lanes and Lyra going to go right into the dragon over this Photograph because they're punishing mid-length so and everleigh and bottom light push and you can see the Jinx not moving because of the Minion movies are going to come for it they're going to try really ocean Drake to come out here comes the sun go back. Does not allowed to burn seals you have a walk away and Hootie at TPC sucked anyway maybe I'm wrong I'm sorry I couldn't get her to fill in your shoes made with you big everybody's trying to do that call now that I know right back into the jungle pick up his Red Bluff and I guess everybody is definitely to secure that because weekly is going in for at least the steel I mean you can say hey both will try and head what about or whatever but I'll fight song lyrics
play receiver so Champion Select is beginning and we have a Nocturne in ergot ban in so thought you know what I'd like it's all I ever play man still available as far as the meat for the top side know so I kind of thought of Champions company has played yet also want to point out we are on pack 9.30 it does mean of course you have aatrox Nerf significantly still very good as well. North Americabut it is flexible first pick Silas it's always makes me think oh my God this guy must have put a lot of games on this island so much better if you already see the ultimate early 104 in the Midway is real that so combination is so powerful through mid leg and they're definitely back here in this must be the temperature back in here is well definitely a quiet song. This one has some very thin builds allowed as well I do want to keep going to be played by because Sunday to me is on Foreman has been for several games we had a couple of good games but have been having a slightly weaker split if they give it to him then we say hey we have faith you who you're ready to go but it's what I've seen on states are expected to go toweird if the other teams has already showing us an early silent that seems like a bad draft moves if you don't have the flexibility I think that the power has to come from that guesswork but we'll see what if life was going through it because you know if black was take some sort of bully talk later at like you Viper wants to play right to take a look here because that's why he already coming out to meet me at the more mail a Solunar deer especially Amelie Champions backup is done so well that makes melee kill Wayne really really powerful and I'm hopeful I really really song is bad so that's another option is just an additionturn on this line up so we know that it's not a bot Lane Zoe So Chase up a tablespoon of the Champions by for could have flavor seeing to Frontline pink fans and end Zach certainly is but when he got poached by Central in themselves to try to remove my nephew's aggressive options after divorce do it for the reasonably well but I'll wait to see what they actually want to fix themselves in the jungle roll and what's her last solo toppling Flex AZ to the Peoria van in there again they're kind of the same breed the a scoby that it's an aggressive melee top winter up there as well jets would really complement the Poke off that's already is do in Israel that would be a very impressive as far as the big game of an orange branch is bandwhat's a good yakult not even now on his lineup and what's it going to be before it's not there for aphromoo but a long time Jarvan jungle what's going to compliment Silas and the Jarvan jungle yeah I like making them so get him to Rome early I like it alot is a definitely a who he's special that will be someday playing sound of something that's offline and now Viper you seen the whole draft what do you fly I'm hoping Avril melee specifically though I really like this who he aurelion Sol pick again oh my God I'm so happy oh my goodness they have a squad moving with your Q Auto V immediately W to get yours done then would have been wanting you can stack up to more Fox Nowitzki get the last stuff you can swap your bow combinations with those who are actually insane we had to buy for an LPS school then asked me how many times has played Robin Hood over 10,000 and by the way he beat freaking a one-v-one down two levels and a caulfield's Warhammer fighting and it's going to be a whole bunch of fun here hundred earlier and now we got vipers ribbon on display simply in store for some firework it's going to be a whole lot of fun this one players already nodding is allowed to do that in the LCS and we're going to see again salad So Silent options for ultimate steals I was like going over those as well freak I think the best one probably the as real as well as the state Ronnie probably the best too cuz he does have a lot of Mobility to go for the islands with it as well these guys invite you said that we would only see vipers ribbon if he had to bring him out so what was it and soul and Tom kench and so if you're going to go for something with a lot of pressure in the side when it has to be something that's really mobile So Raven can get out of those situations really easily so now is the time to bring it out I think it's a really good game for it and I hope I forget to tell everyone why he's one of the best cops North America thank you so much and best of luck to you back to you guys really easily so I definitely agree with all the boys I don't know if it's going to be really easy to get out of an aurelion Sol Roman in a Bissell Voyage coming your way but Viper is the man to do it yeah he's a little sneaky like that so we'll see what happens we wait to go into this one yeah because he what he did with Academy last split ends with 28 Game season 18 game split as I get my numbers correct there either way certainly a strong performer he can be leasing top 5% so when you're on the Fred. caught up in the Piper pick your for ribbon but we can also go over the early game plans for both teams kind of setting this one up because it is super interesting right we've got booty in the mid language 1 Imports against Zoey super early on as the aurelion Sol her waveclear early was one of the nurse that they did a while back when there are try to take some power down from Zoe and so your idea for this composition for the early game is you get Huli roaming early and once you have your act Arrow use that as well try and pick somebody off and look for those early kills to start the stove on me while you seen this conversation a couple times Zoe and Ezreal scaling up for some milk composition in the mid game are going to be supplemented by like Amber was talking about a side lane Earth is going to be able to have pressure and high Mobility to get out of those rooms to go to poke compound one team is what is the opponents have just stopped is Topher to do with the Poke and you got Jarvan and Ash Steven Tom catches pretty good engage tools so they're definitely are ways in if something I can't even let you decide it's up to I think how you actually navigate them and play around them all right now we're seeing a lot of the Silas early Lane phase here someday doing the good job you want to leave an auto attack in between your Spell's veg out of the can unless it's so that one's going to hurt but he's getting the most of his way foot and that's why I try to keep her even under the turret Time Force Viper submissive dies that's where this early Tuesday athlete is coming from for Sunday that's not supposed to put as well you can hold on to your heel or Sunday on silence for those all in wait till you get below 40% for the big boost in healing and hopefully that will come in before the execute from Rivet ultimate you just need to hit that time and where we got to fight down to your voice and a funny when was enough to buy the space force intro in a grab that flew by and adipose didn't actually afternoon as well just make sure it's out of range and assuredly he's going to get it very close on the patient's pain that Grump butt time. Very well by 100 thieves and they will successfully steal away that camp now by the way on the does have three of his own to go back and farm the entire team should be calling out hit stage one he has literally nothing to go back to induce her jungle so she's going to be out looking for Wars at the very least right now and possibly a gank was this body right there as well so easy ping start to come down for 100 thieves and they can continue to track Santa for in WoW on the does Farm up the bread side jungle Anthony goes down to his friends right here I think centaurians read was that Grandpa's up and he's going all the way over to that there's the voices are available in wants to know if top Wings important or not seems like it's going to be to be walking around and going to that camp so pretty solid a hundred things I need to buy this game is very very close throughout the early game farms trading for deeply and wait to see you in the side then pushes might happen to meet you after somebody left it down here if you want the minions and we'll stay pretty close to equal to buy perform here yeah I mean it's nice to see that he's playing appropriately and we see the communication right under wants to cement his lead in the jungle and keep those numbers up for his bottom side clear so they say are weak side is topside someday yes know you've been pushing the wave but play safe now and he backed off let's Viper push it in and they get to reset here that doesn't mean that Viper it's a very nice recall though early Executioner's I love being this utility buy for himself that burst healing were talking about presilah coming in below 40% he might fate himself because if you're relying on that and ribbon has the ultimate up and executioners is on you to be executed ever so come through. Scott Ellis and I'm going to push been torn out get to The Knockout of body block the Q events, it's really really difficult to try and get your Giants iguana model out of the body of any other drunker than trying to body but you just impressive and it is absolutely willing the jungle match up right here in German besides wanting and you can see the gold difference over a hundred the XP they've certainly there as well as 5 verses that gets fairly 5:00 so it's not too bad on that one but it's early and having a great time is early going to be really good stuff not a huge surprise really good job coordinating with his team and moving in with the driving for fracture we talked about the bottom Lane one app remove want to go to hell come out as well and that is how you need to play the jungle in the early game that was definitely a team objective and now we're to the point that we also alluded to where the aurelion Sol roaming and the ashes approaching level 6 that is the key to look for kills because even if you lose your ass here just in your own lane and not looking for the super long-range one that's how you get the lock down to the I get an actual first Blood be there are three p's on the side of flyquest currently since they did have his spell book teleport on and Central in spotted Once More by been pushing enough to be a couple of plates down this Autumn Lane to place already gone so 300 extra gold game that bottom Lane and that's looking pretty solid this duel links going pretty well pretty effortless BF to recall for ashes Wells that's going to be an ie Rush funny really damaged available there and it's just Turtles the least I can just hear I really like you to control a top bottom side 100. Do they have so much pressure with this ash Tom canceling constantly at the tower that was a couple to go towards you should give yourself an early Dragon Mountain Drake going to help them away at the places they've already gotten two of on the bottom side through the vale doing so much work early game this is also going to make the next Drake respond quicker I make you continue to try and control this area Connecticut look at top sides only five Cs difference with somebody's holding on to this I guess you can call the counter pink eye blind. And I forgot Last Choice and he just stacking armor to survive he went grass to get better to stay in and he's so far doing pretty well that one will wait to see you later on who can Team fights book was better but this is been pretty par for the course for the equal to like yeah I mean to me is a lot for what they want to do the composition like if it was talking about later in the game Super mobile for fresh ringside lands early on Lanes been going pretty close to even hear jungle fracture you know we talked about on do is doing a lot of invading their butt no fireworks not just yet hours later I believe it after a few months but I think it's going to come through at some point and it's time it's some days trying to push the rest of the way then by purple
you can learn as well what we're pushing our way back into Champion Sykes over and throw things back over the freaking cold will it get in the game confirm freak has it in his hands now that me and it's Kobe clean hand off as well we did yes to a size 0 and four start but what if I'm coming around when I forgive you this once there one around Arrow back in the country and you figure maybe they're not as packed they would be interested turn things around us hope for Golden Guardians here off the gospel a pleasant start with an Academy have your roster at 2 and 2 they can approve the three here I mean there's a couple ways of looking at it right they call you know what if you're making these switches and then they lose everyone's going to blame them right for changing something that works but you can also look at I like oh they have practice with the team also and they decided it was better than their team that started to and too but it would be a very fearsome team that also other teams wouldn't have much info on 42 day break if it is going to be golden Guardians first win or if it will be optic number two's first win each other so well cover like what you're ignoring Mountain band away from Destiny still not letting them play this Champion I feel like you to wait a bit or stylist here but maybe a blind that I don't know almost always Top Lane do I have to have in the Box before he can be played in the Midland Texas leaking also be plated support however frog and doesn't seem like the Midland type of player player player either way is grab that was not much of a surprise with Raven off the table here so definitely go into the Fearless in this one I don't know I feel like an arrow to play something else but yeah that's it seems like it's possible option for exam according to play really aggressive there's a thrashin therefore be back on the stage. Was subbed out because gate had played more with Austin and we had always heard good things about being a pro all of it all of the people on Optik players as well as management so we'll see if this does change anything for how they operate in game because I got it right here cuz I'm fixing to get locked in there on bands I can't quite tell either way yep that was a very fast what are you afraid of here both teams most likely or gotten by on our top-line go to go to get first dibs on picking their wedding way junglee set of pinched down medium right now about the type of jugular that you want for pro play write a lot of people in the camp of Gleason and kozik the things like that especially in lck so much early game you still buy your lane you mind some to replace you get early dragons and you Snowball the heck out of the game however all our games in North America has been going much slower on average $10 games and when you start to take that into account then you have to think about wealthy jungle experience for can't later in the game has been taken down but some people are often to go with those things like the Newnan that we saw all ready to take Lonnie are they going to operate very effectively as tanks without much levels or evens things like the I burn that were hovered not pick today that is definitely something that can be thrown around if you're expecting the game to go you no longer however I still think that the best way to play right now is the picture Leaf in or out your Camille play Fast get your days off for your laners get here to cleaners Bridge off of her it's okay well go in here and make sure they know what Crown is playing Nocturne is the hover it's been grabbed freaking yato ban against frog into I would like to speak to scrims where that topped off because that is that is something that I would definitely like introduced back into Pro play but we're we're on the docket ultimate as well as doctor can jump on somebody though videos of the same opinion I believe I believe he is okay so cause last time I remember seeing a lot of video problems with back when you went text Brinker are evolving to give Bruiser and he has to be excited around and engaged companies dumping to lead through and give the space for the Cossacks and must think of some way to kite back but no listen to make a lot more sense crown back on list in the midline and out at meet the cars go through ecobee4 frog in Premier Farm play are perfect Champion doubt he would say yes but various was wrong back on the card is going to farm as much as I possibly can and I wonder how much it's going to get canker sore causes pain definitely put damage on that champion can pick them off but I mean if it works out well do you got three Global's on the golden Guardians roster Connors goes in front of definitely join someone's. And let's get some history for people have in frog and followed frog in for his entire career which by the way I use proponent of Carthage Steven NC matchups like LeBlanc back in the days when Roblox was before the reworks and she was extremely opiate assassin he was of the opinion that you can when is West Carthage with well-placed Skittles tea Casillas from very far away you can take desk but still get farm and still be extremely relevant for the team fights for later in the game and I'm very curious track this of course is going to take dark Harvest a Nocturne is one thing but a Nocturne backed up by this giant beam of light coming from the top of your screen to execute you after he don't deals no 75% of whatever of your life means that you don't have much time to react well through the reaction in the game of the day you just hoping to get themselves to win off the shoulder and Tenon roster for the first time in the LCS 2019 season end for a word on Optics new lineup we got to where was that routine thanks guys. We finally get to see the intended optic roster what can we expect from the team there is a lot of talent and well-tended wrestlers with the daughter roster but it's just I would say just another game. Just a lot of time to go to cross the bone so I expect expect us to be very strong The Winning Edge today thank you and best of luck to you back to you guys concise answer well I said it a chance like this song and record it should be able to brutalize a squishy Champion like karthus and he's not running classes over the flash for the way out brutalizer was taken out of the game freak's rated but thank you for the reminder I knew you would appreciate that of course videos back in the LCS as you can see that was his last game already and I know that is one thing to use tasty most people invading his jungle leaving Wars behind GPS won't find anyone and I'll just get the clean seal I believe gardenswartz spotted coming in although you're not really quickly when these guys were coming from my Red Bluff and then big I'm sure they were up to you know nothing nefarious very nice Israel Brom strolling through media has figured it out it is going to be split all right if he's going to go for the shuttle here he was seen over the goat for I believe for media out soon and he didn't he didn't he didn't go into the amazing for kha'zix see if you can actually get it cuz isolation damage do big you will not get level 3 long way around I think it's in large part due to frog and pushing mid-length never I'm thinking about those jungle one do you want yes it is nice to have the bush Advantage for kha'zix if you get pure isolated damage on the Nocturne however biggest difference is 10 mile an hour has come to me first be down because that's going to really ruin your day in Frogmore pushing I really do wonder if I was fired was because you can look at the crab and know that your got burned at the odds armors on the 10 he's never gotten my cool down did I just get pissed when the enemy there comes out I'll let you know I am pissed that he came but I should have it really is your fault if you take that good to know junglas all right well contracts level 3 here with the camp being cleared away is do you wash his hands are going to try to lick his wounds for now you don't expect to win the match up is fine versus Oregon you're going to do what you can to farm and hope you can figure once every seven minutes here because Papa describes was going to blow for blow it's very very close wow overestimated what he could do he got the sprocket is grass-fed one every 7 minutes was it worth it to take it wasn't 300 damage Health back for that stay forever though so long as he doesn't die or pug be punished for his flash know he's warming up these me I never have his very well at is there right now it's got all the one that has to do with his name is worth less than the visually really minor point doesn't matter too much at the Midland if you care about and it's + 6 right now as I can and goes down frog insofar feeling good and the first clear for meetings with mostly tract and so no first gate come through yeah I mean actually mirrored right now contracts on top side fuse on a ward though you're saying he's definitely getting tracked he knows is being tracked Galaxy brain Galaxy expansion worth fighting over or sneaking so big you a good job here early clearing this Ward go to guy's head place that's because there's a huge Advantage for blue side in early dragon and of course that is obviously the blast called now if you're playing a champion that can solo it there are plenty of them in the game right now Glasgow and it's making the first dragon is actually an insane win races so good were there for Golden Guardians that are clear from big and it definitely is a possibility that they have to worry about it specially if your mid and bottom-line are pushing night watch out then for this one is of course that blast Point has a corresponding behind that comes up so but it does make it safer because I don't have earned your teeth yellow it however if you get caught at an ocean Drake ocean Drake slow as you all right well still the safe way to clear plus so far 8 in the midline for frog and feeling pretty good is the crowd Dodie burned is TP to get back to lay a while ago frog is doing his first one here has a catalyst and the way it is he's going to still wait around yes I'm going to go he's close to Catalyst tear actually a little bit after this way will be enough I think it's 1852 the whole thing and not quite as much money as he has right now but he's going to get a good spot if you want to go to the fully stackin bills what is the Catalyst and we'll see what comes up you can afford to you if you want to go for that one darksteel instead and he's going to be just okay to go to go lead over all four golden Guardians and a reasonable early game but not down that much overall it's been really getting away from them in the in the mid-to-late game instead so having the pressure in the bottom lane Ocean break going to go over and it's going to be huge for the early laning phase of optic gaming yeah and it's a caixa that has the language it's okay I know I've seen rank one classic Volvo Gas Works player 2013 shot to Novak game anyways though we are talking about the pushing bottom line as we mentioned before it's even better when it's like I said because of the passive immunity burn through Z Hurley Drake's no big scare here for crown and easily get the clout does have very potent All In Crowd Control shelter and stuff like that it's not interested so yep crab goes over make it pretty close to this level six and there it is for the course you for contracts but we had faster ones from rush hour earlier in the day is to keep playing the minions media to call the auto that one minions with Q does more damage
are the biggest differences between professional league and Venus playing at home here we go there let's get into the game Champion Select Bragg Blvd. It's already off the table as well all right not willing to first pick it definitely the ergot atrox a collie all things still floating around here so we'll see how they want to whittle them down field you kind of notorious for leaving up a lot of power pics and exchange in trying to get them back because they feel like they can play around them or have worked on strategy specifically tailored to expectations that you know the enemy team is going to make a note we will at least have a tosser got possibilities akali still a possibility and I know Phoenix and solo both have put in a decent work on that champion so they definitely be willing to pick it for a dart Transit very good on sign across the three games so far on the ALCS what am I to sign gamesir in lhr to grab the right away and you try to bully out Josh, that's not blame for the last roughly year at does a little bit weaker than is normal form he's been very good in the past couple captions under his belt but as much as good reason he I will see one of those gymnastic split push back at 12 now for Canon or at the kill shirt yep illusion gone across as an easy pickup use as he will be looking pretty badly really drafty or not to be afraid truck's not much of a surprise before she said not to let me get X across yeah I mean basically for the Marksman it has come down to the top 380 carry his band usually as usual KY star the next Tuesday before the second round of bands come through cuz that's going to push you to the lower-tier with work on getting weekend I feel like the other answer had been teams that had good xayah rakan players but you don't slow down a little bit for the long range and the quickness Synergy broken with double used to be very unreliable Play Nothing More for kiting back here these third tahm kench game of The Flipper file Frosty Returns playing field you one of the few standing this still want to do this to yourself very heavy back like we did just see Ezreal etiquette of hard carry a game in Stinky Pants fix a candle to the same and I kind of like the back and forth herein this damn Slick Rick here on Nocturne provides a lot of snow cross map potential split bushing becomes greatly empowered when you have Nocturne in Keizer with these long-range ultimate abilities where you can join a lan but they fired Back Bay pick themselves up as Rio NV Tom Kenny voice has been used so well by team early on in the game to gain momentum odd no rotating bottling up top or something to get to her place in front of used as throughout the game so both teams now to try and make those snocross map or at least very long-range movement overload trip like I think the first 14 amendments in the game so much right now you can see what kind of Champions these teams are worried about Cena got to go to more of the engage I've been saying if you want to play support for Norflex the atrox around and put the orange stop playing in bringing those Sondra those are not allowed for you and if you can aggressive Camille not an option anymore as well so that might be missing or might be reinforced with its own already more nasty covers the way to do that actually is maybe really nauseous I mean it's our people in the middle and you need AP nasus could all you've done a lot of because most of the games of the team that he's on will revolve around Midland alright well as well certainly not a lot in North America really popular worldwide otherwise so we haven't put a lot of games onto a big loser to bring such a house without a lot of other Mala Champions yet so we'll see if he's going to have to stock up most of his own stunts quick lock box is being expires off the kind of universal pick your with Oriana whenever you're not quite sure what you're going against my word I can still Flex from top or mid lane tier old for it now as we enter nowhere asriel X Gwen Stefani or going so what's the last pic where is there. Going and what's going in about half way to say no to me a truck stop in Oregon did for sure and they will put Power of evil honest than in that midlane up against Dorian it will be darshan fighting solo on the Ergo grip vs. orianna can definitely has killed pressure I would put more jungle attention mid now seeing this even though you're not going to have you do extra help. Help those stunts and tricks find it up herself in a lot of burst damage potential at the level 6 mark okay so time takes down Rock Casino more spots down here I do like it looks like a pretty well-rounded King fight group to give us the Oriana ball on the Nocturne shop of deliveries pretty strong right there Jaco has been great on thrush epoche Isabella Wednesday picked up one of those she was him on that champion getting a lot of really good Hooks and getting a lot of her damaged basketball on towards fix a pinched nerve in front of front lodestone with the doctor and as they're coming in since you're ready quickly the shock wave will still probably get off if there's a combo incorrectly those though I feel like that does add an extra layer what's your device look like as Echo Fox get ready to go both these teams sitting at 2 and 2 as he mentioned the previous Cana when you're put you in a tie for second with that black but lost really there is there's some room underneath Team Liquid but there's a lot of space but he seems to get up there and start making the right forward CLG onto straight wins can certainly move forward here and I think it's mean that their fans can be excited for what time do the rent for this one alright Russ going to lethal Tempo Nocturne looking for some early snowballing we'll see how he gets to level 6 quickly or not spread out looks like pretty defensive normal start here for all it's just going to watch the entrances will keep its total crap Ward's go dad usually around 1 minute 20 to keep track of those which one is probably going to have to defer wait to species the Nocturne in trade you're looking as the boards may or may not go down using the second player to kill a drink at War before it turns invisible sometimes you can double up in a brush or something and get lucky and positioning on those brushes and 4/5 fraction 6/8 you can see already got it it does have the klepto so usually the Ezreal likes to go for these early phase of damage but he did not see if I follow and did not land his cuso nothing gained off of that klepto war and those are some slow attack speed Champions not able to get the last one down said you want me and her got will know that the version is here at the very least that's okay ultimately no harm no foul who sell was actually looking for it here puts down the poro and the ward that will see the crugs beware Wiggly goes next for sure they're going to have information here on Wiggly no matter what can't be goes to neck unless you go straight for Scuttle what you'd be insane Sunday's kill pretty good start and you have those trucks going to be spotted so it will be a known jungle path and I expect to see a thing up there or just simply solo saying there's the pink sand yep that's where the champion. You can only guess that's we're not friends going but it is a very common past this point to go running to Crunch yeah and they do have their also bottom work here you can see since they're pretty sure doctor starting off my bedside and read into frogs up through the river for the bottom Scuttle is pretty common you can go over to the rafters after drugs as well now this signals to me that he wants to get his cancer respond as quickly as possible in a rush to level six his rushing level 6 usually just want to do all of your own noodles to get the second spawns up if you have to do a full second wave of them to get it and not necessarily using the time even to go into the river for scuttles running back and forth pretty seriously here rush I does not go by any Vision to Again by him not looping around the bottom side they have had it surmise he probably did Raptors search either way it's got to be no problem for him now will be spotted but it's too late to do anything about that one as they trade some camps and that's why he has a only partially cleared drugs that looks like there's a hair over there's the biggest thing to write this sausage why don't you can count 11 so yes dear and you can say he is cleared his red side probably not dipped into the top side Scuttle and he should be able to get both shuttles now at his nose that's why he is cleared the full top side there's no reason for her to go back that way and should be able to get up very early level six. Nocturne honestly all right well darshan pushing the top five selling to get some of this BS is be a little bit awkward the dash gets in the reset just enough damage this one is going to be dropped her. Also so darshan here this is why I like to see from the top laners darshan since you've got the early shove there with her got the moves down he blows the plants plants so they are the fires Bloom so that they get the vision on tourist visa how much work he's doing he doesn't have time to take the Scuttle able to deny it from rush but they are keeping tabs on him for sure and write well double Scuttle still feels pretty good for the doctor in here you mentioned how to rush for the 60th power clearing camps still getting all the crabs and I don't feel pretty solid now getting to be too late bluebuff pick up before minute but I'll grab it but that's probably okay they also have the timer on Craig's remember it's 2 minutes and 30 seconds for a respond of a small camp they had vision of it there for Echo Fox nose and he did yellow pink on the crugs I said want he's going to be here now he's yellow painting this trybus word if you do that to your top laner is so cute and they still get ganked and they died that's an order on you at this point so so loud that I should know that he's here that yellow stuff you wash rugs Wiggly getting slow down flash flash for nothing last of the face check again if you wore these out there if you want me to tell you is Flash I mean it's that is definitely is a bit of a filter not working at a little bit earlier so you don't have to lose your flash go see if they're even punished for it though yeah I'm a chocolate doesn't have it he is also be up soon though to contest with the ergot alternate typical Sheen recall for 6 a for the azreal that's what I think you said what you want listening bad happens to your forced back early can a flight for a bit of land pressure is the RICO going to come back for a follow-up was well at first plate to able to get some early money here for Apollo and I'll glow boosting recall time of year because I'm going to the face of a non-padded waves and protecting fairly quick for 6 AM, shut this down they can deny some farm from the caixa it couldn't have PP of course it doesn't matter anymore if you do T P Henson Farm Lost TV show, in bottomland 4 Pro play just for that wave management let's remember this is the area where they burn the flash so that's usually what you want to Target butt again level 6 is coming in me and syndra first potential and this is not a barrier Oriana this the cleanse drink it out of one of the Sun but definitely going to have to be very careful about the pure damage that can come out because we'll be layered ultimate as well as picking up passive can be done now you have to do your passport before the ultimate one if you want to use both those preclude you from using it again so we'll wait to see is the first things have yet to Really Happen topping was just a flash force and that was it you kind of knew it was sort of coming and that was safe enough brushing a third skull oh baby did you guys juice Russia's feeling good farm boy yeah it is best he played the carthus size on the doctor fully-formed up ready too old and he's a minute faster than the average to level six year 4 Pro play Global Lisa Rush feeling pretty good about this one is a sub-7 an ultimate look for the plane I will get any help back from that yeah a lot of lot of pressure being exerted by the bottom line here following hawkwell getting their Turf late first continually pushing in WoW Wing them to get vision of the river once again, I talked about last game the highway of summoner's Rift is the river this allows you for transition plays early on in the game between all of the Wayans that's where you see a lot of the early game advantages game no not only is a dragon but it's also Rome's of support roles of the jungler you know getting off those early flash advantages definitely mean the difference and let's see if they can find their exit on a spill on the top side he's mostly back on that flash the only two minutes left to punish this one otherwise can I get away scot-free in that war doesn't really need much of anything Peewee differential controller top sites can help attract some of those movements for nocturnes so even though he has a lot of level six offensive potential syndra is a very very easy target for something like the paranoia especially when combo 2 with the Shockwave looks like there but not trying to be able to Shield it up Echo Fox put the least ring the cloud and there it goes over the jungle is a feeling pretty
he's going to start kind of ramping back into the LPS in Skyrim starting now she's going to start putting Greg in a little bit to see which one's going to come in for week for ourselves as we will see if that becomes story later on but for now locating still a dedicated server TF2 original reason why Greg would take a nap equally to all of us is downtime what's good to the Champion Select oh my happy about that because it's been a powerful strategy and it's been one that cloud 9 was using before this week you know before we start taking to the next level with the chase Jungle of Stapleford 5 9 and 4 disc specifically there's always pick was very big one upon out for those you just run yes we are still on 9.89 point three being lied will be week 4to call Lee coming in which probably going to move her from Pro play so silly Kali band does Kathy have been as well as the note we have yet to see in North America but it's easy then and think is most played Stampy I just flipped I would be a contestant I would not be surprised and then Bandit to deny the first opportunity I know they care more about the urga all right. Here are available in the first round and that is going to be picked up quickly buys then we have the possibility of carrying it with ROM you know the combination of bottom way do I think is so important right now the illusion prom is Iraq on like those two go together almost as well as a champion that were literally did * 5.4 Champions League here waiting around for the counter picks and not rushing for any real as quickly as possible to get a kind of that solution the two mosthighly prized bottom winner Siri Sonos the price on this one that's going too far it's definitely a very very flash at least I'm still stunned bundle camps yeah so they definitely still very powerful in the jungle you can go for the early gangster lean and also playing other synergies with this Champion Camille very fast heart and gave champions in the entire game coming to the Jungle Rolf really compliments with some other form of for Tanki engagement on your name something people immediately think of galio because it cover the whole screen of a secondary engage that brings more tankiness because Camille does have that weakness of being able to get you know Focus guys very quickly other popular option include the love songa spa for support you can even Tom Petty people and we still see time spent a little bit rock on around there in the wings as well so you said wants to I got to wait for what they're going to ban away from Cloud 9 going to go to make their own choices now they know this list can be a flex pick broke but of course and play up in that Top Lane you have played it but instead it is very first responder most likely in that Midland and there is a fall open gate this is definitely a classic combination here and especially with the Ezreal as your marksmen you can add the damage from the ultimate from very far away on the enemy Mapsco TSM have to be so careful about getting picked up by the Camille and galio combination I think it's important that Braum's finds itself on the band here to get rid of sweet tea coming in they're putting up a shield that has Champion alive I feel like I kind of need to be seen here right now getting ready to leave soonultimate and drop that entirely and open Alistair Wednesday's is trademarked Gates Championship matchup is super fun as well smoothie even though it's not the most most people know him for his time on cloud nine right that's where he got most of his accolades do you want First Team all LPS support and he he definitely was a huge part of the rise of Cloud 9 or kind of the second coming so definitely going to be interesting how it goes up against days of who's the guy who originally kind of took his spot and we'll see if they do have that support battle that's going on in fan phase Right Now tips on Champion installs need to talk later in a sport you're going away to be a kind of picture that I would say most popular Eyes byOptics but also brought out by hundred thieves Sunday last week and denied my vote would still be taking brown right here since we can't grab it and they able to force the most places will be as forth from game in five overall crop the LPS and I put on Panic they want to play themselves and there is no surprise here the third pick here everybody that would be cool really going to support the year without really getting into it was used by the best dunker in the world Tarzan on lck the juggler for Griffin he was the one who kind of innovated it in it across the world that that's what comes from being you know the jugular for Griffith but I actually still prefer going with something like the Derp hog speeds up your clear and you can transition into Redemption not necessarily need to rush for it so fast unless you're actually going to go for it will make a big difference in the morning anyway thank you very much for me and we should go over a lot of Dolly stuff you know it was played over Europe a lot of the power and we're saying and tapped out come to a situation like this where you could already see all the animals with their feelings they also have a very offensive Lee oriented just lay here to propose at going for the early kills even onto a tank KTM bikes on people sometimes I want to see the focus from the jungle North American League of Legends players for the other team just another variation of the room choices here I've been discussing it's a lot with Dash cuz he's been playing a lot as well but we'll talk about Silas as soon as we get some info from Ava Lee thanks guys Silas the first pic that we see coming from Licorice and 5-9 reapered what's the inspiration behind the pic and why is it going to work today Mission and lysandra in a Scion or so so it's pretty good for picking Silas not going to lie Osceola rolled steel the game anything that you think you need to look out for from CSM today or not Reaper thank you and best of luck to you back to you guys and I really do hope that this Silas ends up having at least a significant amount of a female you don't have to go for a PS4 singing at jungle in bed here already since they do have prom that's going to be a lot of early and then gets to stack some of that manner and let me get a pencil Red Bluff steel is Olaf is still in the blue box to outside of a pretty crazy opening it should go pretty from this pain and back smoothie can't even tell that easily with a smite do they already got to fix up that Redbox deal and we'll see if the road is going to work for a Canadian to take the grand if you can try to go for that topside read interesting right because when you're going for his invite you would think that they're going to try and isolate it but already you can see it's been scared on the Camille is going across mat part of my training is going on in there that's a lot of damage but look the Camille is actually going to get off Scuttle nap to protect that Silas Lane even after going for the red invade here so Dave is sent Billy set up the possibility for a 3 bucks on Acadian traversing here since I guess this Scuttle crab I was back down can get bottom and protect his boots I don't need a kitty in the box then was warded coming in for their aware spend cut across the song when they saw him go back towards the Raptors so I want to see what the 4th Camp Fish Camp study for Acadian as you fear the entire left side and he is going for defensive players going down to his own cruds they're well aware that red was taken so is either an aggressive in bed but of course block by Ward will the biggest thing is the bottom line pushing here for TSM allow support for the jungle right so they can move in for text Acadian allow him to continue maybe I can test your inside the jungle let's take a look Midway know is actually going the favor of Cloud 9 phone if he gets to come down first and Acadian might have to just call it quits after the Scuttle take those Steel on the Scuttle attic and kitty one for them at once then going to let her be a lemon garlic is back to Lane and if he's not going to get touch stuff right here this is going to be pretty clean but no one wants it has pop forward and keep my heels you can't be tried everything taken more power clearing Spencer and I'm walking watch the patients on the Blue Buffalo if it switches targets one more time it would reset they just send it well do Cloud9 arraylist to hear that went for svenskeren that's pretty big that's really big is only one Camp left up for a Caden he is going to be down fat third Bop it's going to be a one buff Olaf the folk liras in response you might be down XP forever but is down that but the exact timer respond timer on small jungle camps is 2 and 1/2 minutes so if you count the five waves for your lane or are you keeping track and Subway like that you can get there in position for the next respond and they did take a little bit of a while delaying at the blue box but it will be kind of a top-down Fleer for him meme licorice on the Silas up your vs. broken play the early stages not too exciting sure as they're just training but you can see the bills coming out already and I do think that it's pretty solid licorice has a seriously so far with how much they've been tracking Olaf I am going to go for a galley of he's able to freely play the planet and not worry about Gangsta until now is it okay to get the first reset off and when the biggest thing for us is it really does enjoy melee melee matchups because of the power of the W right you can get huge healing off of it especially below 40% and that is what liquor is Max and right now he's going for the klepto for the extra games off of attacking Champions right now though one no slow single small chicken drumstick hear me to still with a kid in this one look up more of those Rapids go down it will go back to its Pain Care and so freely equal Trace right now it's Cloud Nine about 300 go to head over all as a team with some pretty solid Farm in that top Weymouth stuff to help him quite a bit as well. When it's sticky looking at moving to the overall gold right now so busy with double cut those on the team as well as gold inflation for of the discrepancy there there's teleport on sticky so is it to use that to get right back to land when the biggest bonuses of Israel and he has gone for purchase rather than you know waiting trying to get the last I was forced out and act as a Canadian early on that is a very dangerous thing as so much little attempt set contesting these jungle camps and liquor still feeling good trading go top as a burn their teleports as well we've got the specters Callie ever Broken Blade and the beginnings civility Powers theme examples of big proponent of Cotto belt Rush on Silas stop playing this means you're going to be delaying have your CDR like a luden's echo and Elena's like Lich Bane but privacy either couldn't quite get it sign it also it is one of the coolest ultimate steel for Silas though even if you do have a little bit of a pee because it does have such good ratios and I feel a lot of people steal it and they go bottom Lane to try and use their but you can also be used even in Lane if we do have jugglers coming up and now he's doing the ultimate liquor sizes when he's ready to look at something just want to run it right away is a question but the thunder thunder tour it's not just yet here and it's spreading close Tennessee esteli this ion pretty immovable but he
I'm from elimination and they ran it all the way to the finals which day one fanatic here though speaking of winning the first match up with TSM and it was largely off the back of self-made Zebulon a lot of people scrutinizing that getting through the Bandit does not this time around I think there's a lot more conscious time you are on the right side are you going to give up the Gangplank van or the threat band now because both of those are very highly prized Champion they decide to keep the hello thing pressure down with ease games like in the reason why is bantel often is because he has held a 69% win rate me more that he is over his entire career with his Champion fnatic is one of the teams that loves making crossmap plays do use ultimate from the topside to backup self-made in any of those bottom side of the map indicates that they go forhow to make dragon play all right so brave Premiere jungle pick up Kyle Whipple to play a match, stop playing her name is Ali met him in a bit later and you still got the damage that right you can't just a cat Mar or armor because you decide to come through we are going to get the most prized junglers at Worlds this year in Italy is I believe the number one most prized Champion as a speaker I love playing The Office Encino Evolve game for 25 minutes has gotten better since and we continued PSM style of playing through Top Lane Broken Blade on the Camille she has been an absolutely huge Paw Patrol on both sides break honestly to the the Camille pick up here is just barely Bowl because they haven't thrown any Top Lane bands that only the only one that could be considered as being taken awayMatt Poole Ave Louisville into the commuter lots of options for fanatic and they could go either way do you want to go team fighting with a horn style do you want to take it with these Phil match up with Broken Blade and have that fight at that's what everybody wants to see with o versus Broken Blade throwing down with Carrie fan played in that lane regardless Santa comes to your right away here for reckless his most played at the split double of second most Gyros while I'm. If we going to see TSM Rush pick a priority to Portland like a Bard down here for biofrost I can help keep them pretty safe as well give it seems to be gauged ears will come through or if you need to contact Oregon Like A syndrome surprised at all for fanatic multiple times that is the one for to beat a man carry for this team so more support of 80 karrie they are brings healing to the graves and they finally did get there and hear their graves Victory is different so excited aboutsocial media that was that was definitely kind of a benchmark for that even though his previous great beings have been so in a well-executed by him let's take a look though the galio Camille combination this is one where you can make picked around the map you can also backup your jugular the analysts I thought I had a really nice judgment on how galio is is about an extra backup for your jungler we used to have previous memes of of different iterations at world where mid laners would have junglers as the third Summoner spell and the tables have turned my friend when you walk in galle out now and we get to go put those dresses aggressive invades probably towards the top side towards the Camille and you have galya off the back you up give you that confidence to go for the all in and it's time to start coming through and it's a real Shield there aren't goodwhite starters and let's workout split push the Camille which there are pics that can do at such as Jack's Renekton you can see the more prize band right here I do want to see if we go to find another and get Champions like maybe about 5 if a duty ball to Hillsong on YouTube say a Bard or an Alistair or rakan or what the plan actually look like earlier the voluntary probably most likely for the side of fanatic right now but we are hoping for a little bit of spies we know that it's definitely has extra tricks that they have practice for pain comes through here no more reckon available Bal cross will not get to pick that one up first PSN to have their pick of the litter though they could go something like a Leona and just go really hard on the ticker for hard engage honestly that just gives you so many Tools Plus taking away where the possibilities of heart engagement from Fanaticsfootball championship this is a good one for if you have a lot of things going to land on your whole Squad wants to Die 2 player she is but I think she's fine wine and knock them down and refuses to dodge all the scent of still shots and what not and we're going to get it expensive to support beer out of Hill House on as he can do it this game every game that's fine we need to throw Spiced Right now like we said our advantage p.m. coming into this no sitting up there at the top of the group tied with the rest of the members of TSM are the ones that are in a must-win situationI kind of hate for the heart engaged part they are going back to the types of propositions that did really get them here they're looking for aggressive place they want to be the aggressors they want to be the one forcing these decisions on fanatic fanatic they'll have gotten some very nice mattress for them self Whipple I think will be a very comfortable on this volibear Nemesis has actually stepped up a lot for this team I think that's one of the areas that people were initially looking at for fanatic being a little bit worried coming in and summer but he had performed really well so far at world and it's going to be about where will self-made go Ken he hard carryall right quick fist bump what your ranking system for a 450 wants to go with stars or thumbs up thumbs up thumbs up for me sightings it is a incredible Battle Gear fanatic have only sale getting out of group at World once back in 2014 which was 185 Samsung white and it was the Travis beef in the quarter-final Fanatics have Time and Time and Time and Time Again Play excellently their last two World Championships were only cut short by the world champion but not a year over year over year with roster changes caps went to G2 rocks went to pee liquid and if continued to beon the rear fan Fanatic in 2020 or yet another version of this once again fact of the LSU final once again tied for first place now in the group Boyz pick it out here tsf it's a 03 stock for them have already been eliminated on that 3in pre-record TSM win every game today to make an atopic fanatic they still got Genji and LGBT but we will get ourselves out of the rift for the first game of the day and there's going to be at least 10 game has so much going for right now freak so much extra pressure here because as much as Citizens backs are against the wall and it's a must-win game for them fanatic also really really really want that first CD coming out of the group that gives you so much more momentum moving on through the tournament and considering the way the department is organized dodging the first he's from the other group will give you such a bigchant at moving deep into the tournament or no to the first bead spell far soon in order and we've already seen that someone will they only went 5 in 1 pop group b as well as those the teams that you would Dodge by getting first place in this group and if possible could get a first as I would probably asphyxiate yourself and exciting battle PSN fighting for survival fanatic fighting for topping the group here to in 1 vs 0 and 3 last time these two teams fought it was closed but fanatic made better place throughout the game and came away with the victory navigate to watch a rematch alright level one here from fanatic going pretty well if they do get the Jeep were down for themselves I do want to highlight the jungle matchups pacifically for these two teams speaker has been just what TSM needed in the jungle rookie player hasbeen outstanding for them meanwhile he's going up against a star player in self-made was been front-and-center leading fanatic to Victory after Victory and I actually think that it deserves a little bit of a deeper dive here while we don't have any action we also don't have any sweeper is going on so probably no no Laden vase and we can we can go into a deeper discussion on how the jungle meta a rose and why we're seeing so much of these Tower clears of of grazed in Italy yeah because it's it comes down to kind of Jungle Theory at his most basic at the same time is money is especially true for jugulars breed junglers you have to travel to your camps to your objectives and make these choices so efficiency is your highest priority and you're constantly being judged on that the best dunkin the world they'll create advantages for themselves both by increasing their own efficiencies in these Ways by playing a pass for the camps for their objective and reducing their opponents possible options that is through counter jungling and controlling the vision because if you counter jungle one of these camps with both of them are currently playing their own side cramps and and you do it without the opponent being aware that they don't get a chance to alter their path and make up for that lost time I think the biggest fallacy I've seen some of the weaker junglers fall into his ex best travel time and losing out that way because if you try to explain the rise of of Grey's Anatomy of the power clear is in in later terms it's kind of like if I give you the option for increasing your your minions spawn time to every 20 seconds set up every 30 seconds sounds good actually get to do and these Champion are able to utilize the pressure of their lanersgo then create those opportunities and take them away from their opponents looking after the full clear level four doubles afraid I'd say about forty seconds ago TSM sussing out a likely full clear and end of the day it is going to be a 1 Camp difference right now to do bottom Scuttle should be a formality there for the middle leave it has left upper Rock through her so far Through the Jungle to be a pretty easy climbing we're back at 6 to 6 self-made walking through and so it'll be easy for us to know this happening and he will tight back 5 CS bleed right now for Nemesis with four left the farm Jarrettsville get close to this Mark but it looks like you're looking at the beach travel time for these junglers not wasting any for each of them both of them getting off the phone clear splitting Scuttle crab this is kind of what you expect when you have fairly decently even lanes and a graves in Italy match up they get to choose their optionsthere's no heart submit from a a grave newly seeing each other it's it's usually I stare down unless one of them has a big brush advantage of small chance for some fresh from the topside Brooklet had a drink at world that would see if there was a grave gank but the waves in front of his grip bo4 getting a pretty early recall off teleport list and getting to doran's items you can CBD help are still getting worn down Broken Blade low on man with a biscuit to give me another rotation to spell but we're fo overall up and farm catching up now level 5 as well Brooklyn might have a pretty hard time believing him any further in this Lane and this is one of the reasons why we just expected of Olives are right really good trading power here building up a slow push on a minion wave is an opportunity also to call your jugular I trade in a minion wave is going to push poop go back this is an opportunity that's plenty of minions to try and keep in front of your Tower trying to knock some of these minion to Pueblo and get a little bit back here will probably see the teleport come out from Guapo only now have to worry about Middle Eastlistening because the jungles have been powered clearing there hasn't been any of that extra intelligence-gathering and the extra information and he's going to have to be very careful with his Warden which you can see on the mini-map places that control board and the drink Awards so even if Natalie Haupt over the back of that Daron Pitts would be seen by the control board and has a drink of water can try brush whippo covering all bases nothing. Weiner to your notice a big play in the bottom so I want to see coming back and forth we're going to be okay now file Frost is going to be starting now as all the durability drops off it'll take some decent damage and of the day though she'll comes up for his safe and self-made right in front of speaker is greatly reduced Drake information not gathered Goods sneakers play self-made first Drake diplomatic as well yep self-made Dragon right there is able to do it all himself gets right in the back there a speaker has been waiting very patiently for another aggressive move but the big minion wave pushing away from
and both these teams at you looking pretty sharp. We'll see what it looks like I didn't go to Bud Candy playoff teams that may be poised to do so right here Camille Cathey is so far off the table and I got to ask you some more rock artists from Rush he didn't seem happy so I told me 02 in a week in the ALCS so we're going to win today because Rush will never go 0-2 in the week is that true after this weekend yeah and now that has been brought upon broadcast it's one of those things where you couldn't talk about it you're the magic to stay alivewell I am interested again as you pointed out of optic disc like red tide eye when you think back to summer as they were certainly a team who was doing a lot of cool stuff with Connor fix they were doing some stuff they did your kid if you are they've been a lot of different things in that regard so I'm going to be excited to see if they have anything up their sleeve deer with the red size collection all right now is pretty standard stuff for. Nashville surprised with basically no one in this draft but keep my dope of a certainly a Big Top Lane counter Pick 4 phone is back in the last season he was one of the big short players he had lots of traffic to a lot of the meta top laners look what we wanted reflect picchetti metagame now we're going to be locked in your life around and drink a little bit weaker but we will see as the Lord is not hard for Xbox and is locked in that being said can still be our got mad and you could have your top or not to take for a lot or vice versa see if he can fix for Crown straight for these days and pick ban it's basically band Lucien and then you know pick as real of that stuff and then if you look back taking you pick I then it seems to be those are the only Champions really getting play in the bot Lane these days with LL he's a lot of gameplay. So certainly not surprised to see that foreign support a feels like a bit of a flavor pick we start to games from JJ last week we got Seahawk will bring it out yesterday as well but was that shut down pretty have Levi's think I'm parked by the Nocturne pick on the opposing team very hard for Jaco to redirect in all season and catch a lot of players with the when I was billion in the mix right here of course it's still can go support though I feel like it's more commonly a mid laner but going to be able to go watch we'll see what it comes with that said I do think you could kind of Isaac I always look at it as agreed for it and I didn't warn you can kind of play a bit of a scaling support what is not the one who should be pressuring you accept Lee Hardin Lane is not the right if you want to get some extra value out of that bottom land I think that's something that you can look to get away with it similarly is lck people bring your galio pics and if people are going to play these passive no lames you can start some kind of try to one of them and I'll steal them even in this world so what's up with them spells banding York and even the doctrine that I feel like I haven't seen College delayed as well cuz you can dive in and just be revised to be that he'd take methyl and isn't choices here we'll wait to see what David wants to fly keep in mind that Joseph had a hurry just might just pick it again but that's not an option here early Band by a fox in that first phase no bra no Kindred know not to New York was mentioned on the band certainly is expecting that off thick is already selected there till later jongleur target support would be the obvious rolls to still remain and Articuno least in is available rushed you know could grab it up himself if he doesn't want to go for it and we do have Comcast 4th so we do now know that one is almost certainly it is going to be Miss Deli in an end top laner got in top loader I see Ezreal jungle can't stop but I feel like I'm like to hear it open or nand a lasagna for set up really all about Anna farming with double Karthik big this week Echo Fox used to be focusing more on the early aggression the ganking power from their jungler go and listen yesterday kha'zix today Ranch going to be grabbed up remember that is being picked into the tomten so you know that can be a fairly difficult matchup but we have seen great directly or so I just talked with navigate this well and you try to hook onto the Ezreal and then take that in as he gets devoured you double play if you could do something different that is a disgrace I don't care who wins I'm glad it's not supposed to rain guard in the jungle before. It was a jongleur he was a top laner Wrangler made it look there anybody have you talked about this billion-plus Nocturne. Exceptionally well with billion-plus Rengar throw one bomb on to ring guards head speed him up he jumps in that explodes adding Stephen Morris Fascination power they're not to mention to revive the certainly a very strong Duo there and see how well they are going to therapy because you do expect 363 kind of waited a bit more toward the Cossacks and lysandra and this is a Top Lane orange slices we didn't even get there early mentioned because we got to got distracted by the rain guard here so not a lot when you see these days ever since the W Shield was removed his praise are so much worse and he is a sinner. So I think it is a very tough matchup that track how wealthy is going to be able to survive up there if they're left on an island so I'm going to be something to walk 4 hearing exciting stuff this could be a very so far is this season I like him so far as a player he's had a short career in the ALCS but I think he's been pretty solid and we're getting into the LCS stage on the rift game 2 of the day Echo Fox and Austin was even get some revenge for being taken off the roster Optical with a largely Academy Focus team 3 in 1 start far above almost everyone's expectations and it's interesting conversations with people expecting Arrow to have his Visa coming for next week you know if I've heard people talking about that then do you actually swap in the rest of the intended LCS starters with that if he cares or 3 and 1/2 the even get stuff doubt you subbing meteos with arrow do something no one is I keep it Rollin in a few the hotter and it's interesting question because even if on paper or some of the other players are better if there's if everything is just kind of clicking right now with the current optic roster yeah it's hard to know if they'll make those flops I'm slowly but of course really teasing is the time to figure things out CLG done a bit of that when they got their first win yesterday we'll see more of them today as well 7 to watch for ASRock SLI pushed around and the Damage going through 4. I can do no for Rush also time bomb I'll be fine but he's going to be quite a bit lower for this clear yeah we'll be a fairly low but thankfully you know kha'zix it does have a pretty good to clear and he's actually going to start rapping so maybe just doing a double you start here very likely to be starting on that Rafters in Hilo doing this probably but do you can go Raptors read the Scuttle something like that but. I certainly going to be having a better time with his start as he is getting a Leash tab didn't get poked out yeah it's not too bad so far though rough with health and puff W start is reasoning a lot of hair after cancer so does seem like that was already the call with the child to start in the first place and it's both posts down though on the first camps yeah that's definitely hurts if he does run into dock but should have a pretty good time with things as though she wants to get to the Red Bluff over and everything is still be totally fine yeah alright well getting food stamps right here with a fridge in a power clear on the docket looking at ah play no surprise circles in the early Push Pull I keep checking in later on throughout time is as they'll mention there's not a lot of toppling or in any more in Pro play the rating is a lot weaker but we'll check in throughout time midlane actually sofa what about Brown actually because we heard from countdown to getting the day there's a good chance that Crown if he's single most important pick up of any team in the offseason and he has a very good his actual c s b St at 10 is highest of all mid laners Nelson and who is undefeated and also liquid the best team in the league but I think a lot of places that are doing well yeah they definitely are infinite sum of its me that much more effective when you're not surrounded by this all star in a 30-40 pass right out no 4th PL it's a whole Squad of All Stars basically in an optic and not have high expectations do to succeed anyway I think he is extremely impressive and it's it's been a pleasant surprise because Crown a lot of people do think that suit you probably will Champion the last year in the lck crown was certainly struggling at World they had an early exit as well so we didn't even get to play for a lot of the regular season nearly make that and they happen either way he will at least pick the crop out and it's Rush us to get away from this window clip with already delayed Bush Insurance discount goes over the optic sight that's a nice little invade even though he does not get the blue he still has nightmares no chance of Russia was going to be able to pass that with solo plugged in and do foot roaming over other crap to see another really talented player performing well in the ALCS always good to see his first start with Renegades all those years ago and dresses that one of his trademark Champions and those two have done some pretty good things throughout LCS before but they've been some of the major right now coming into Midway surprise explodes with some people are hoping for the consistency of Apollo been pretty high and have been one of the positive force wreck about getting win a really good word to describe them they have been very consistent for a very long time they are not usually considered the best of the bottomlands Malik they're always going to somewhere more on the middle but I do think that they are consistent performers they can have high highs that I certainly will you think back to Spring split last year HAPO a famously defeat the first team to get a knockout to get them before the finals with clutch there in an aqua having an incredible performance on thrush dumbass Champion against one of those for and so far the bottom it looks pretty decent this is like I said he was winning Lane and not feel pretty positive sounds good for something more passing the match of any way you expect some of this to happen anyway but I can just as good in Russian missile of mountain break as nice as well left over that sound cool. If you were found to have to flash but looks like the early Mountain Drake will be a formality here is like a fox or going to dedicate the time to Snow Camp anyway and this rake is worth gold Annex be more than it was in the previous season and so slowly slowly slowly not Drake is the tankiest of all the Drake and slowly but surely it will drop Michael help take it up and they will get through the mountains right here in this game not bad at all it is one that I have to get anything from it early on but kha'zix is already an incredible bear and take her as his caixa so if you're looking forward into the game if they're in a good position that can help to enable that much more and appear on the top side dhokla is level 6 solo is not so they may be essentially looking at depression with the very least but not going to try for any crazy times bar is around but he's 5 with 0 XP to spare so close to the level up anytime soon so I was back up and going to be a while so that comes out and happen and wait to see what comes through is it simply a only 7cs sleep right here for dummies nausea denying that much room still owe those holding up pretty well nothing to to crazy but I do think it can't get tougher for the tanks as I get some more levels and passive cooldown shortens up and then she wants her you don't want something like Black Cleaver that can get really really difficult to deal with all the city are the levels that he picked up by that point but we'll see I'm still looking make it through at the Landing phase I do think this is still an incredibly strong a pic for the team fights right you know the ultimate is incredibly powerful that really is the bread and butter of the or the engagement and she is extremely high so we'll see how well he's going to be able to perform I know later to do the plank over the old way the cast of cursed as soon as you talk about him doing okay he does get solo killed up there do classes Spellbook ignite plus the ultimate in the fade enough to knock him down I think these are sold at least you guys have two tee pee so should be able to collect that most of those minions for the experience and gold but definitely going to feel good for a joke to be able to get that sorted springboard into words that Black Cleaver there is one more time that he has a Spellbook ignite ready he is Bubble 6 able to just really connect with everything he flashed there for the not really any time for so it's a reactant that is just really well done from dhokla I'm assuming she peed into the river because it seemed like solar was fairly far up and he kind of got around on him a little bit and fellow just a not maybe noticing until we're coming in or for under estimating I just how much damage you can do with that ignite available the rest of it in that was really nicely done to your good son coming through Crown going to get rid of a lead here in this HP do you want to see Lenny face and we're seeing Crown behind and farm that is a big fat
pretend place but we thought they were upgraded there as well and 0 through is somewhat of a shock to us to see how it goes very tough road to get here they played are the three best teams in N A Garten Play 3 the week or once and still can pick up wins and they're hoping I can get a lil bit better I did talk with him and management yesterday though and when it was pointed out was it in gets tight until this game their first three were all the stuff you know that's at least deposited are going to pick Blue Sky for themselves if you get a chance to do better this time around they are get unemployment even so I can feel like a return if he's around yeah definitely the case in for Golden Guardians you really are looking to grab a win here today because they have I believe TL coming up very soon I can get them as well so they have some very very tough opponents coming out in the next week or two also it really does not get any easier for them and everything's well they have had their Fridley the toughest part of their schedule already is past they lost all threegames and it's more about the way in which they lost right it is about the fact that neither of those easily none of those games look really close they were pretty handily beat me in all three I know a lot of people I do have some concerns about that because you could look at it and think okay well if they were tightly contested give their clothes games then steal this could be the fourth best teams league and maybe it is what it is we're difference between the top three in the back if you will come through as his game is underway or not being picked up or down the golden Guardians and I feel like I can be going to someday who he has not been having a very good what he's been so Love Field to get I believe the worst gold difference at 10 of all mid laners in the LCS right now so getting the Carrie feels like the wrong choice. And having a good time that I have a bear I mean no he hasn't plane carries he has been getting jumbled attention and he has been you know what losing these games as well it ishas not been someday you know Sterling valiantly in the lost its breath the team kind of falling behind most of the map has really been collapsing in the first two games you could look at bang it's okay will he still has strong performances directions Maps kind of fell apart but then yesterday against liquid they did get decimated in the bot Lane and you know someday at least on the York has something happening but that never really got going as can be expected when the rest of my life is losing all right well and is going to have Camille here in the jungle and he hasn't even wanted it brighter spots I would say front of these devices Bureau in 3 start the leads he led the league in Gold difference in spite this year when to run go to bed at 10 for junglers Kalisto and I have still been pretty strong and Camille certainly a great really game fighting jungler can take some things over when you got a chance in one of the two so lame that certainly one you want to get ahead and its many games would be the same here for Sunday if that akali is going to the topit's a bit like the flexibility there Alessandra can be Flex Tonneau to match up wherever they do want to go. I just can't commit or tossed Oak and lysandra are we are expecting to be after chocolate Sondra with a lot of people are pretty comfortable in that matchup against the akali down that akali did not have the ability to get into a shroud and and have that safety there that would look really good turtley a strong powerful Champion lissandra the most pick mid laner of 9.2 to the second round of bandanas billion drop away actually ended up for a little bit there to be picked up as well so like a more supportive billion but right now hovering on towards that rise which again we can still see Rise Play the Top Line as well but we did see who replayed call you recently that we are going to see bang a locking in this from prefer milk come from is DiwaliI will see if that is going to 5th and final pay for they do still have the ability to flex a collie top or mid and counter pick as they so choose golden Guardians going to eat rounding out there's wrap here with what we assume will be the bottom Lane Super Bowl winners are they know from the very beginning that sir. Lysandra and they chose to tell kids have a jongleur now will wait for the last so low that like the draft but they can defend their findings to the compass going to line up well we're going to go for a sport late-game Insurance you're on the basement and I do for actually like deathly most on mid to late is dire for example is very good all throughout last year but Champions like as real and as I stay here I think this is his best fight style and I think is best for him as a player, some top that footing Sirocco on side or Lane only quite good at Sammy's more Meiji supports that has another thraka here as well and they're going to haveprice of quite a bit heavy tr400s asriel is going to be the physical damage their Camille is also but no more more people are going towards these more AP heavy styles build for a real self know we may see people picking up some more magic resistance to help deal with that of this rocket certainly will help out quite a lot of them lays a lot of players are in about a high-level actually skipping was going to kill until quite far into the game at some point and sometimes going into two points you to point D before even picking up the W at sometimes level five or even later so you can play this fairly of rectal you can play a fairly Lane dominant Style with a suraka with a couple points in a few and eat and we'll see if that's what they're going to look for because Brom is certainly a divorce Champion that you can really get a bit of aggressive on it and if there's a really kind of bully around in this Lane that's Rocka by microinteractions but I'm going to ask you a question you can past Camille ultimate while you're still dance with hook shot rightglamper you can cast it mid travel I believe so yeah okay because either way I want to be able to send them down and now you can't do the show up unless you cast it from out of the rain so there's a nice my friend raccoons where you got kind of a telegraph pole that you can stop early on so I'll be watching for that with all the way here on this one is actually time you're down field on a rise ultimate I think I found a can be quite powerful the akali if you can actually have enough lock down there you have left on your own if you can overlap your silence out of that so there is certainly the ability to do that against really any Champion how you can layer those species there and if all that up for the fear from Nocturne excetera excetera so there is a lot of ability to layer that crowd control from Golden Guardians won't see if they will be able to do it that's all we are on everybody has the first game of the day is herenot having this darts they wanted and honestly a surprise to many fans at home as well we'll be back on the right sofa to show up a bit better than he has so far this year and Golden Gardens hoping to turn things around the previous to get themselves yeah we are going to get Aftershock rise your little something that school is may get a new face has done right away. Left. Need to heal their yeah it's not required from Honda and that will make him and definitely have to play a little bit more safe we do students killed barrier in the bottom Lane so very are being taken here almost a Rocka that combination especially you with his head if they have Gear with the 80 also bring you'll really does make us talk a lot tougher to Target in DC fights and that's something you're going to have to keep in mind this is also, it is not area so this is even more Lane Focus along the style of bill that I was talking about I'm very much expecting a couple points in queue a couple points in ddr4 Olay because if you want to go the more defensive style area is going to give you the shield on the heel this is purely for the office with the comment your cue does hit confirm your comment with the flow on it so they really are looking to win Lane and starting down one stunner is it's going to hurt that a little bit it's going to be scary to watch for but we'll see contacts me to grab this red buff invade not looking pretty OK or this is pretty obvious that sponsor was Li Shang they know where the ergot came from kind of Dodge the war of the way out so we'll see if and as for my distance and goes in a vertical junglee actually looking like he's heading straight to the threat so he's actually just trying to go right to Red then Retreat back to the top quadrant for a Scuttle in a blue and and now they know and yeah they do know now but can they really do anything about it that's going to be a question they both still have it available and I think you do with the rides being pushed into a dangerous for and is dry out of froggen that is still worthwhile I will you take a flask decent trade here and then opposed to war. If I can take some slow way back too late I thought he should expect it to be coming from that side of the map and really foggy should not had to have had to give up a slash yeah he wasn't that side you just was so afraid of being used to fight for this buff and Anna getting Boscov's actually is level 3 over contracts you tried to grab so many of these camps in and keep them for being denied that he is getting tonight anyway plus the gate coming through successfully so despite this deal to better to start trying to deep time around the map because I'm texting from red to Red Cross map during that time you know honest farming more pants so he is going to be in that regard I got a flash down or for the kill down a level one as well as the flashlight on. Lane so has already gotten a couple Summers for himself to be taking the wrong way here and I'm feeling quite good about where they are sitting right now in the despite a nice dark contract that we have the early game lead for and in the jungle and this has been a common trend for him so far this split he is a player that I want to give a lot of eyeballs tour throughout this split is 100 thieves not looking great individually he is standing out and we'll see if it going to season around how big of the parts he's going to be in it over although it's his game is still fairly close Sunday are doing quite well so far in the Top Lane against Hunters been one of these stronger players on Golden Guardian Sunday 7 everyone is waiting to see him come back on line back to the most MVP for him that he was last year and I call you can certainly take over definitely feeling good on this case it with the Soraka support you should be winning Lane and indeed they are feeling good so far against big enough for me and you know it is worth noting that someday becoming fairly, but this is no he's going to leave for work and then he's going ravenous Hunter and taste your blood secondary you start the door and she'll just doesn't make you very very cranky and hard to put Shadow Lane so despite the range disadvantage in those early levels and credible amount that it becomes very difficult for her. To shove you out I got to follow up on Soraka no pointed heel just yet for a late so level for two points to me as expect ya DMX Rock has been middle of last year of what are phrases like me a lot with Matt for Guardian support innocently enough and you can go to Camp Dodge least you got a lot of damage out that way the 44th the TV out of pain but if we're supposed to post here recall so he's actually find doing this it just acting up here for now we're going to have definitely coming back to base before too terribly long Ortiz rocket has and going to get more gold generation we look for the rest of our lanes in front of course have to play a bit up in his magic to do anything at all and it still supposed to get a check that size garage door will stay alive still has that level lead so it's going to be three straight scuttles for him and it feels very good about that is that you know he is getting a fairly significant damage and going to have the experience to lead as a result it will really can be a very powerful of his game right now at 3 to level five glows sure but there's no Camp to take right now he's sitting there 3.0 who cares what decimal is because there's nothing to grab unless he can get up to these frogs and right now just sitting around being a at 6 minutes level 3 Nocturne still 3 to go for the crugs because aatrox is under threat you know they saw that somebody could be keeping back and rectum beating on if they don't see this coming in but it probably is heading down this way Fernandez here instead of the contract is still on the back and take it away and us with these are absolute slaughtering this jungle matchup now it's like in the Midland so I can withstand it for the Easley and fights for the war if I lose a lot of help in doing self how to contract finally will get level 4 Office Camp but it's another to cast going to retreat back up to his Red Bluff as well as those crowds in and we'll see if contractor is going to be able to find a way in when you're getting such a delayed level sick to just make your birth alternate that much more important you have to have that impacts because you really are falling I friendly far behind well-described Camp should be 5 for contract to go to respond worth quite a bit but he's still got a ways to go to zanda 6 off of this time is now it goes I think it would be enough XP and he's going to be well ahead of the global average year by over 30 seconds and level 647 715 for him it was a really nice job honestly if tracking contract anticipating where he's going to be in after moving in for some for of war and trying to make sure that they have eyes on contract and denying as much as I possibly can from him the bottom side of the always pushing boss right now so worried about a half remove us a good slow to buy a bit of space will he go for the Q flash or you just like boys like you. And now I had to take a bit of damage and this will be a non-gay and they really are getting a lot out of this so far up a good fifteen CS already is going to be quite by Nice & L o v even skipping the Gill still so this is going to be at least two level seven before we do see that coming through so this it really is you know fully Pope heavy to Rocca has already run 427 gold from the support questo I could be stacking that up quite quickly and really having a strong impact on the map
but it all comes down to how you play on the day and there's a Top-O-Matic right on your screen and it's lickerish it's hot there they're both excellent players and begin to pick some dance at Golden Gardens locations they want to be able to pull off some up that's here because we said we was supposed to be there this week they're going up against it and I do believe hundred thieves as well as to the teams that are expected to be near the top of the table so expectation for Golden Guardians there staring down the barrel of a 0-4 start which is really not where you want to be this is supposed to be the Revitalize reason for all that is going to get to them to playoffs after if the two very rust flips in a row where they finished tenth place this one fell through the victim Bears early on so 442 made up the topping to try to carry later on it so far we are not seeing these Champions Banda waste a lot of here and rise from before are still up but beyond will get rid of Aurelia a call he's already gone castreally almost anyone take that chance except for Griffin movies with anyway but that's the elaboration across the rest of the week to flex it as much as you can plan around that work early but definitely going to have to be worried about the ergot is a champion that can be Flex around quite a lot here a lot of people that were throwing some shade his way for a role in it down a little bit in their loss on the dude early bird Raven definitely had driven band against him I think was actually both games yeahcontract is already so far so he has played back-to-back head real game not sure if he's going to want to go for that salad mashup if you do want to just play to farming out to play safe and couldn't go for something like that but it can be pretty dangerous playing some of the more for the short-range rolling out South Champion so maybe simply the third straight as real game here for me and I think that's what we're getting around certainly priority is taking their turn. You know what that's okay you do what you want I do for the interstate so far across 9.2 leaves going to be third most contested Smuggler behind a strong sense that's wanting a child support and he definitely has a lot of bands but this one is also pretty common one either way Lee still going to be up here yet again and it will be too early game aggressive fighter junglers here with Camille facing upLaura slightly somewhat but still shaping that I think it's been since place by chance I would expect of that I'll be your got certainly do could go either way mid or top LeBlanc be winded we may simply PBR got to admit I've seen a lot of players precum fertile end of that matchup simplify rushing the cowl tag marketing positioning be pretty banking at least neutralize claims against me with walking But Rising to be taken away we may see some more band started to work any potential Midland power picks against fairy numbers standpoint forgot to take his Boards of physical do you know lots of armor for a champion and I just tend to be good against a deferredand I think taking whey an aggressive before that can really enable the greatest to really shine if it makes a lot of sense + Olay know when you do think about a lot of his best games they are usually on those aggressive play Make Her Say something back to his Immortals days we was really I'll look at as its play making guy lots of thrush lots of Morgana finding this picture is team being that aggressive player warband out as well here waiting at last band will be will it be another word for he's mine Zanesville was a big Alistar Mains but all I could easily take that away before you get to doing it would you go for Target man like I'm working on it instead specials Draven Morgan to get no stye on dropped off they of course know that gold ready to pop later that's fine I can we put the girl got there if they need to do to put in something takes sign off the table and away I mean if you are comfortable playing there are got top or God is definitely a strong mashup into the Scion but final Rose is such a solid pick and does give him a really powerfulwines are perhaps they're just trying to eliminate any potential Frontline to make it easier to dive onto Champion such as the grave in such as the block removal out-of-state fees there no with that big Frontline sign would provide can we just get the second Victor game for housing or picked up a force which naturally on he's played a couple of Mages and well go to the gardens vandalize themselves back in the Victor here and didn't feel good and licorice who plays Victor with a lot of your game out of monster but still the 3rd mate now for him as we assume that's going shopping now if it's Raven or what's going up there. In in the matter but you're more comfortable with the counterfeit the other Lane and go I'm also really in to see if there's a chance of getting an AP garbage here that is a champion that scene was going to be hotly debated so you feel like it is very powerful as far as an aggressivepeople out if you want to play that Draven aggressively dropping those flag for the pope also giving you additional tax because I work there but obviously if you want to keep driving safe contents turn we allowed to do that until we can accomplish the same thing in different ways because you have this pumpkins behind you you can then play much more forward you can step up aggressively trading knowing that I'm going to save you and I think it also is a nice answer to something like this do we break the chomp someone off out of the TV bubble double in and really the earth safe for the one cuz I have to have to have you do not have hard and Gabe outside of really tricky things like pumpkin fighting a back line and contrast been kind of a text flash so getting in on the Poke team could be hard like it puts a lot of pressure on fragen to Sandhill answer this with the Distortion Fordham if you are that could be difficult for gold guns you play out the mid-to-late game but Will Smithlooks like denied have it or got top bet against Victor up there and we have two of us really am done with early game keep fighting I do think once you hit sticks on a lot of these characters if Draven is winning Lane as expected you can play around fought with champion likely thin and the LeBlanc while it's hard to engage if they have eyes on you have a second to no dragon test or that sort of area you can certainly when those bikes you can certainly take pics around there so we'll see if both parties is able to get that sort of curly game advantage and still both at in Jacksonville has a similar style of game plan as we saw echo-fox attempt last time it was going to be a fun one to watch what I think's wrong shieldwolf brakes but they don't bounce off a projectile so there's a lot that I think could do here to really break think the farted I was going to drop the Raven ultimate that won't do anything anymore. His victory you can prevent LeBlanc 4-person the back linerhow to prevent be aggressive aggressive plays out of Golden Gardens but could be very important Cloud 9 1 and 1/2 liquid they look very sharp golden Guardians a week start of the season but they could certainly do well here with a new lineup we are on the rent and you get a win against C9 here and the team could certainly get reinvigorated from that and see if you can beat C9 then maybe they're going to look a lot better against others to use the certainly a lot on the line for Golden Guardians I feel like in particular but really both the squatsokay we are on to this one let's see what comes through across contract now for several years in a row has been off Cloud Nine 50 against them that was all of last year didn't quite have the results you would have hoped but once again against his old team got it was a bit of a surprise honestly when he did depart from Cloud 9 such a promising young juggler and know a lot of people did think he had a bright future with Cloud 9 but then moving over to Golden Guardians Pine obviously haven't had a lot of success with send Aaron and you did last year throughout the summer split a lot of fiber and you know some people are still wondering will he start making it through rotation because why else was here and I think in international play oh yeah it did look very good during the regular season ended up solutely so it's up to watch for as well keep on going and don't spend quite good starting play no games here as well for sissies look pretty good don't get me wrong it's not a scene I need to change this but I was a very deep bench on that roster at 7 to watch the fourth time goes on I better start Salisbury like to hear foreseen I do when I think what AN 415 at the very beginning of their season other summer split boys look to in one here either way we will wait to see what happens to see Red Lobster at least taken by both these jugglers and that also applying for some lame priority up here a little bit faster to get out of the map Fest at least it's actually from Braum really is always such a nicely Swiss classic rock to Stone there is going to help you a lot and it's red straight top side Scuttle here for Spence Karen to see if he then tries to take that down to the boat's I didn't try to do a double Scuttle route or if he just wants to secure themselves one shuttle Canal on his phone's out of map with lyrics pushing you already nice stuff there for licorice q and W looking pretty good here in about 1/2 HP liquor has been really good lately Better Living snaps but some of that is Champions played may just had to Farwell in the early game who would have thought General often are going to have a nice Advantage rashly know when you are playing a lot of these klepto style Champions as we speak he was playing in the early weeks to get something like a Scion are you are expected to get a pressure of energy for expected to get a bit of a farm please please do so far pretty uneventful early-game we are tracking the jungle path slightly here is not directly send out a cast on his bottom side looks left up part of the only took a part of them get level 3 on this and be ready to go to fight for more of this jungle and honestly think I'm going to split the scuttles 121 but also from researchers intuition is going to have to be to deny a lot of the would-be Gophers been scared isn't really good path for Tasha yes really really really so good to take that away from his opponent look at the actual decide to try to look for a diabetic it would be very hard to talk to take down the aisle prom and the Ezreal so I'm backing off for now drop the ghost portal down there for a long time no use does not the champion that could have been me the chance to fight right there except what to name is right there if it lands there's no way of course bleach down but just the ticket warrant was certainly attract Spencer Knows okay six cans I know it's against those were and it's going to be more total allowed XP and gold to contract as you slowly go to the rest of the Jungle yeah and enforcement lessen the situation where it's very obvious what you going to do now there's no Camp stuff on the map they know that they know now that you're going to be out there looking for a gank looking for a vision so the golden Guardians Lanes now have to play with some respect towards that knowing that there's no real other option he's going to look for a Game Spot Lane to go towards Scruggs you do it was taken and there's a ghost for that's going to see him and you like okay we know Camille has bought Lane she walked right by that pay ping ping ping deal with red circles down there they are well aware but if milk is too which means they know what we're kabila's they have been tracking Spence going right now so he will be playing back enough they know Hunter safe up here and pretty both back and forth a very slowly to the Victor Camille could be a Willie anticipate that he's actually in to do some counter jungling of his own remains to be seen as I use it looking towards do now is there a wait might be able to push him off this but yeah right now where's the team got some damage totally wrong and always got to be there as my phone for Stuff Latin events Karen will there be more it's a sleeping LeBlanc that was brilliantly Garden City good job of tracking Spence Karen as I said that they would know what he had to do with that level 3 cavile comes up and I'll wait 5 hours so incredibly well you did not get that kills get the hookshot is not stop identify get there with the loss gets for the thing. No way to get out so we dropped nearly flash but definitely is on the roam washes in contract flash Cube and the bullet hits of a round of Brom and take them down and basil going to go down as well get in there that might have been a second feel but yeah I'll never be happy about how this went all right good stuff here golden Guardian 302 head feeling pretty good momentary Top Lane Advantage do not elect directions to old fellow covers with night and start playing after which again because of the wards down and going to look okay Sprint store in Ellicott wounds. Still have more camps far but use the XP difference quite large 524 the advantage of contract if you want to go to the police in right now sitting with that first blood it's going to be pretty nice when he does go back to base and spend that up already has enough full for a call fieldston I would certainly
I've been seeing a lot of crows experimenting with some different Picton soloq fracture think of these different strategies in excited to see if anyone's going to break it out right off the bat comes out through here as well quick things to do when I can't talk about nurse coming through lissandra so far globally and 9.2 is the highest presents mid laner that is the most common to happen in that role I expect to see her picked in this game a band away but we are mid Oregon 1/4 still really really up there a Sox lost a little bit of presents but is still, as well so we'll see what I come through most likely get away from the tank top lace you're directing solo to do well as broken play piano Casio band just yet we'll see if she has time is going to be forced into that band a Casio has been considered at least in my Moto Pros to be the strongest pic of this is a picture of a lot of people talking about as a triple Flex at is going to get banned away we did see the atrox go to Broken Blade in his loss actuallywhat he did look very strong at the inlay and getting multiple solo kills on hunie we do know this can also reflect over to Bjergsen so you know strong early Flex pick their yeah I was going to be answered by another Flex pick me up from TSM in the irelia we could be seeing the irelia going top we could be seeing eye vac blowing mid likewise with the lysandra here I have even seen a little bit of expecting definitely black Pixar the name of the game soccer is well and that looks like that foreign days locked in here now it's something hover waiting for Phoenix the Locking as well either way though normally Champions are most frequently seen top that can't be true for all them anymore or it's the sport is a pretty big like you wouldn't get voted out a lot last week because we going most liked it too hotthat is definitely what I'm expecting you also can see aatrox jungle so it could be no Jace madorin top Asos jungle so there's a lot of flexibility here for Echo Fox but as it's standing I've definitely expecting the Jason try to be matching up with the irelia the order to be going to 4th and likely then leaving that eat rocks are against lesandro we will see if he's actually how they want to prioritize these matchups then if they want to try to mix things up and and maybe confused yet I'm a little very little bit of for example j-spot Lynn and Apollo was one of the players last time this is definitely a very flexible line apples to its really come through your freckled Fox but midlane is still open as a possibility here with admitting things like orange before aatrox jungle today's top afraid of that since you're coming through as a middling kind of picking that's what if you get some fans right here. So far this season we have been seeing a lot of Corky9 barkston but if it's somewhat in that you know the sort of the style of play the chase in the mid lane a second as real game going to be coming in here for his friend who had his best game of the season in there winds are only on the Ezreal look at very very confident he'd be drafted like this a lot of physical damage already being drafted by echo-fox a lot of diving and kind of attack toward that marked position without the physical damage magic damage jungler I'm trying to think of things that aren't there but he did say he did thatall I know. I would not believe I said in front of the other team real things that Russia ever says I feel like you'll be a jungle pick to come in last 40 years before they like that one down at the fox at the Lock in there will come just as well they do probably need some magic damage and I think they needed for Apollo and and with rise being locked in I feel like I talk to me like that and then dry cough but definitely a pretty a typical Draft come here from Echo Fox on standard I could be the date that you said I could certainly fit down there a rise Vada something that has a little bit of popularity as well can help us a foreign know you can throw down the room prison the pillows behind then you can come and get that knocked up the chain off of that haven't seen a fair bit of Aftershock Rises well installers you a lot of people really liking that is providing on the man with that W Yep this is a very non-standard style of draft that Xbox hasn't with e415 you really do have to punch to face half the snowball the game that is not something I think we're you I don't want to go late against a girl who's going to be really hard to walk down with the additional safety there of the X Kenshin powerful dive when you're looking at lissandra Nocturne irelia who can fly into the back line and could be really difficult for someone like Jace or rise to revive against that yeah there's not a ton of this side of his okay don't get me wrong but this'll be fun to watch Forrest. Jason will be locked in for a paladin that's what is Champions are in this matchup I'm not fragile that wasn't all that was going to be very very fun on both these teams one and won their only loss is coming to The Undefeated Clutch Gaming back in a week one of us will be more of them later on is going to be a battle has been very excited about TSM did you look very good they were in control inelastic clutch last week expected winter here but I feel Fox early and look great in with the god fist Lee sin app to pick up this game definitely came this is what the fans happened wanting from this is what they think about when they think of Rush when they think of his dominant performances back on table do you want to be p s certainly is this style of play I need you to be set up well with powerful solo laners to arrive any trucks both strongly as the game for their where to see if he can take over this game and fish tackle box do the victory do these teams tied one and one Echo Fox and TSM doing battle rash on his trademark Gleason DSM all looking pretty sharp and broken plate on a pretty Heights upcoming in known for his high mechanics Champions it's play another Carrie matchup we see him beat someday and hunie in laying in the very first we can go up against solo is very good that has a chest out play here and there really was a truck match oh yeah I'm in a really has been kind of checking all the boxes a lot of people were concerned about you how he would be able to perform especially with such a tough report in week one you're going up against Tony is dumb day two of the strongest top laners in the league certainly and he looked very good getting sold Hills on both of them the only criticisms I've really been seeing Levi towards this guy is that with the leaper happy head over honey there are better ways he maybe could have played around the map to snowball that game but certainly has been an extremely impressive player looking like a really strong acquisition for CSF are absolutely he's here now we are into this game random note I do want to bring up Apollo was the work-in-progress name of Jace actually when he was being developed so a bit of a name Synergy there it got changed over the course for public but I thought it was interesting so there you go. You know Jay in both of these last week that was 200 on that right and you know we haven't seen it elsewhere in the world will hens famously bring it out in the lck a lot of players looking towards Griffin and saying let's do that pretty good at League of Legends Olaf Olaf with Redemption yeah it's really everywhere coming to the Jungle so a lot of players are really trying to learn as much as they can definitely one of the teams that has helped to popularize the allowance for the early Lenny face down to the Portland can't say I've seen a lot of days for down here it's kind of a friend every once in a while but I surely both very Poky both pretty minimal I ever going to be probably Sears at about these characters on pretty early on but currently it is supposed to lead to Echo Fox and it gives Russia bit of control over this site said leave for the reward still be seen by force, but either way I can't even take a cop's gun without much tissue expecting Acadian to be able to at least get one of those early priority on the vision around here we'll see if if she's going to try to make a concerted effort to take away this blubaugh and it may end up in vertical style dumpling and as it seems like Rush is going to head up there knowing that the vault did Rome out of Lane we need to see Acadian head straight down to Echo Fox's blue buff and just pray that away so a bunch of guys making intelligent choices I think it nearly minutes here and it's expected that he's through the Raptor camp that washes least it has not and they're just to be traded a blue bus going in the Bronx right now so it is a small XP and ncsf didn't hear me when we get these vertical jump legionarios when the jungler chronicles of life and in fact. Right because some Douglas will try to stay and actually three it out in full clear that's out of the map to be up an additional where is Others May only do the Boston to be worried about a class or BBQ camps and then be worried about 5 so we'll see is Durham going for that. We are and it looks like likewise Acadian is actually just going to leave the little willful Ivan and do a full can of clear here also looks like both jumpers leaving a small wolf but again the difference in the Raptor Camp is here right now but R Us Toys R Us the Middle Lane Phoenix can look for the but the year of the walls going to put jerks into safety this mid-length plus 7 for the DS emulator the top side of the map where his jungler is knowing that wrecked would have to be coming from that bottom quadrant make that is very easy Escape for intelligent positioning and tell her to come back awareness there that is allowing him to to make that gank was so non-threatening right but also you should always get it right picture of you on the bottom is pretty good damage I hear pops couple of riddles that he's supposed but got a new free one from Optimum he's doing pretty good about that but has real Tom kench I really don't feel like you're flying to Iceland to win anyway you're playing this land to farm to stay safe so that really does leave me to believe that your son is going to plank heavily towards the top side map looking to gain Coastal lands with a que tienen as I talked about Xbox does have strong soul in the game for the police in very well as irelia fuel and that's even though klint is available in Phoenix you might just get first down to a doctor and also plus a full of Sondra combo increasingly common Sophia definitely is kill a bowl of the plays go to write on the TSM side you can cleanse the one son but actually comes out for the cool down his back back in the second round of jungle clear keep my we are at knife-point see where the camps are work a little bit less XP after the first round of response across Pro play it as mint 17 seconds later to get to level six call worldwide Pro play Seventeen seconds later the office for junglers now despite what is early OSHA 30 seconds of going to release him grab the right there is Rosh and that's exactly what is massive especially for a lot of Champions Michael Jace like the ride that is going to be really really big for them and really often times it's just like a free Winfrey or laning phase is there are from then on out so excellent job by Echo Fox utilizing the fresh with a hat on the bottom side of the map they have the winning to be do they have a strong early jungler and they have already made good on that with that Dragon stuff right here than it is slightly up for TSM again you can see roughly one Camp does fornicating the headgear in the Middle Lane is almost a full wave and a half here for bjorksten but otherwise it's pretty close. Thank you very much no more detailed breakdown of the at 1:50 right there in the jungle and another 150 in the mid lane that promote the DSM Advantage is right now on top of this one is still low but not be subjected to a K-1 visa to up your butt when he will be nice truck by Katie Weldon knock up spine enough my room to cut that out and broken play taking one purchase too many had the flash available with on the ultimate did not back out of the Tower and that is too early kills going the way of Soul of what an owl play I believe a lot in Solo last year I thought you was one of the best players on what's despite the big-name still showing up here today and here is his one more time I don't know I was in anticipation of a joke that that's what I'm going to assume there but misses on the ultimate and then it was like from here they should have been able to actually grab the kill but broken Play Just decides okay I'm going to hold the turret you finish up this is knock up there in the Saving Grace broken by taking one turn shot too many and then knock up buying enough time for solo to get to kill there so that's really messed up there from TS diamond gold still very close to even but significant Advantage for solo now on the top light and the old lady in gold belt with a safeguard advantage and kills them a hundred gold but also get Vonage instead I'm going to spell it has both those flyers up there burn their flash sew Acadian is down resources however it is an option to level six between that repeat that can happen if you have to keep in mind that there was a pink where there's that word is turned off I don't know that Rush is in his Bush he is Kid Flash available around here comes rise as well
ring in Moon who was the academy jungler at the start of the Season play to the first three games went to and one with the LG Academy here up on the main stage as well getting into rotation but this one you have to get him most Academy Sport actually only one and three with the line of soap have had some troubles the academy legal to see if they can step up onstage here yeah of course he did retain their bottom Lane as well as what most people are looking at Frost in 6 days while the team didn't have that great success by a tear those two were very good stuff people looking for a kind of the bottom of triangle of the math to do a lot of work for CLC email let's see how the academy guys do for optic Gates violin almost always yeah pretty much every time I've ever seen him so very happy to see where they are going to pull out here catching sharks band out on their side definitely big Stella Lane power fixed for the current meta and Galileo will join those two as wellall right well waiting to see the last couple bands to come through is healed to get rid of a star. Car fixed and I most believe they would call them carries and pain Rengar cause it to be in there they got yelled at on Twitter the jungle Air Supply would like to see you as well so I'm very sure there is a lot of tank so far in the ALCS in the fridge before it hit the rest is up or God is available right now rakan is available I mean file Frost work on is one of the best for time that I have seen and I had to get a lot of League of Legends free so I guess that goes through this first phase I would expect the LG to pick that one up for their bottle and as wellvery quick with those engaged you can combos are with the w make a super fast they felt like they really wanted to get the Impala first people I say that definitely worth it it could go to dark on but I would expect them to give that one to powerview Belen you don't put that amount of playmaking in his hands, for the self Champions or got the most tickets 2019 season so far in Pro Dry Dock on Camille's getting pretty strong as well as around Camille top us out of place but it seems unlikely you call the raconte that's in the Percy LG as well so cruelly gamepressure and counter logic gaming to lock and lovers do it on his bottom size by a giant you at 6 a.m. biofrost 115 their match up taking on any comers optic brings out pretty nicely for COC how they want the draft to go they've been able to acquire powerfor kind of there three Power Players very early in this bat meme at some flexible fix for themselves with one of the most about the most I can still be Flex the top weight as well around with this. So if either of those two can't take either Lane Crown you think of him as kind of like the malzahar guy right look out has a lot of option A lot of Versatility can't play defensively can't do play make it for the team as well it kind of fits with what you think of when you think of crown and I will do it come through on this one as we wait to see Greg is back and drag it depicts the moon has brought out and Academy league so far and I think tanks on a little bit of Spanish is not going to play Zack crappy of a game I still feel like they need Frontline probably stop and don't know the write-ups composition but we'll see if you will come through AlistairI'm getting rid of food Gates off computer as well we get to see of marshmallow have asked it is well by himself so we'll see the marching band comes in a collie right now with the police guarding against it because wassaja can be versus I mean girls looking through Tompkins also gone as well good Defenders of course when you got to call her running around you want to get rid of the options that can defend yourself against a champion so here we go the last you round to fix optic she was once a student needs a flatliner there a spice that played it once already in the academy leave I still got locked and I'm pretty sure and I got to find me defensive maybe like a Brownsburg 8 keep him alive very limited competitive history on Asta I had a little competitive play last year in various minor leagues outside of the outside of Academy itself formerly known as she played this week in Academy so very very short resume here for us before we can't without a tremendous amount of course and a list and lock you in place so it's going to be about how kids feel defendant is a feel very excited to see this one I get that poke through the minions bush is a wave on her as well so that the lasagna cannot Rome and Leona are leaving the charge to sign those dyes cleanse the mall. Even though the cumulative either Sophia we could be under a lot of threat those tanks are not defensive wounds were content of hard time feeling yeah and if there's opens up with the ultimate long-range garage people did Lyoto can throw down her own head and put a stop to that pretty quickly. Long range on that one as well okay last 20 seconds of fiction band is going to be no more trades we'll see what it looks like but it looks really fun to do battle spirits to make his house yesterday View for the year said to watch the Power of evil and frown at work both these players are truly excellent will be fun to watch them do battle for the coaches come out we get the handshakes do on one coaching Advantage for all right ready to get on the field for our third game of the day freak Fieldy and optic making some of that later changes to their roster. Even though we know who was the Texans are starting jugular who's very recently added as their started juggler I also coming from Academy League will see move another face once again after getting head Step Beyond Seas they wanted us try all 10 players get them the stage experience maybe even compare how to do on stage 2 scrims figure out their best 5 players moving into the late fees in and moon like the first time he's been around the ALCS of fair bit was Clara at the bit to find his next chance into the main stage he's got that opportunity CLG Novia great start to take down. At the Contemporary of his maimuna. Came up at about the same time that. Like I feel like found a lot more success you can do to find starting spots on teams throughout the ALCS moon to take about a year and Academy and thought he was deserving of a starting spot but no the given the opportunity now he has it again with CLD no see if they can keep that under control from self now as we do get ourselves into the game awfully caught up with Optics coach that booty in earlier in the day these guys I did catch up with Sabaton earlier in the day about the surprise roster switch and seeing a lot of Academy players coming in he told me that are all still has to wait for his Visa before he's able to play so that's why they decided to put in pasta today but because they only had one week of practice and they really wanted to set him up for Success they decided to pair him with Kate the academy support so that they have the best energy and then it was just a domino effect from their gate have the best Synergy with our dog so they decided put him into and you know what why not throwing a Lauren while you're at it but the one thing that he did want to stress is that this isn't just a team of five rookies these are all experienced players and you need to treat them as such back to you now thank you very much I've laid out so far going to talk to you is kind of said the same sort of things that don't have a domino effect in that one games before and now they're ready to go yeah I mean Crown extremely experienced tell ya that played on the biggest of stages as well as the one member from the original amount starting roster that's still in rice out out and put the entire Academy in monitor here though so it won't be very long and the opening started this now we're talking about the jugglers initially because we're focusing on moon as well start a clear both guys that just came in here and moon on the stage one he does have some decent Synergy with darshan in the Top Lane who's take ignite on a collie I think I want to point out here at night to pee no flash yeah it's it's definitely more risky a call he does have a lot of Escape moves already in the kit the sometimes you know you still obligated to you that's actually damage there for the all ends with her because she could snowball super effectively as an assassin as soon as you get your level six even in a champion against the champion like her got it is definitely possible and they can stack up the stunts for 6:20 very quickly however. Here is on Camille and once again Redbox level 2 you get priority yeah you in almost all those Jewels Szechuan he can fight OK the most for damage to the breakups your ETA about a minute-and-a-half by the way to her back into the game so pretty soon here darshan on your screen capital and lowercase r as in all chat so both optic Enfield you saying they're ready and we might get our unpause very soon here in this so the next time I want to watch for if you can come out ahead on your colors going to be exciting this guy I had been a really high top with her for a while I feel like the last year or two has been a little weaker for him but he was a game or he's on a house it's Off The Rez paston in the akali and he gets go back up to be that has her household and he was before he is taking the risk here no flash going for the extra damage and night definitely especially late game can take out a lot of a squishy members Health use that even on junglers this is free ignite Nerf well so a lot of times if it goes up against there a poor moment you can just immediately turn on the jugular try and focus them down ignite and you know come out with a one-for-one or even i-140 at times especially if you have something like Triumph ultimate comes through on to this is also running late to work for the healing right keep yourself alive throughout all this the result secondary for the region and let's see what comes out CLG looks like they're going to be playing for the land of the bottom line it's going to be a call Li Li Shang for Sedgwick. Leasing for Camille biofrost going to get face pic Spygate not going to do much here just as the client q6 I got to leave Hotel Bossier very potent level one as file Frost able to give it a shield from Bayeux France that is a great start already sealed G they're bothering was the strength last year and they're already starting this way again welcome to the LCS takes that trade and he unloads almost three-quarters of the hell bar there was going to be a lot of ground to make up be mile topside Camille did go red and scrubbed it. Trying to take tops pedal securing some xtra-vision here for alarm on the ergot know if left to his own devices or got very good Laney doesn't want any sort of intervention from the stage one that's where I could get dicey and they probably could start snowballing you got to be careful about this Camille things can get dicey really easily and let's see what comes through the valley still being pushed in we've seen I have to do his best with the week Lena deciding to Torrid in Farmington came out to win off the sure a bad start to Lenny Facebook and certainly come back later on we'll see how this plays out if she'll be coming through not for MSDS off by 6:00 a river be taken Now by noon since pretty safe here and both shuttles will go over there. I forgot my Chase shoe and rest of his jungle ready to be taken soon enough to be able to do a coming over so I gotta catch might just know he loses this yeah I do like when you know we'll head up for Scuttle controls try to spend it with our dog had moved to Scuttle all the way up to the top side but necessary if you really had to use it to secure so it was closer than they are with a female that is usually the goal because she's not that great at clearing her own can definitely like to take advantage as well as getting a vision now Leona always poses a great setup for a Camille as well that's why you can see the bottom line backing way off your they know Camille is bottom side or at least was 30 seconds ago because level three on the Leona respectful to level six optic running why are zte's Elaine has one so they threw out the making should have freaking push priority is zero tolerance I have to deal with all their own spells to do this this could matter in the mid game maybe is Drake spawns up you get maybe a good Lane Bush and suddenly and objective goes there a way by Drake is give me the first responding this one could be nice Moon just probably getting the first Rico gets the Blues night. I've got boots on top of that recall so lightly you better powerspec pick me up
play all powerhouses Megan is a view in North America it's going to be exciting Sunday definitely a huge Terry we didn't talk about on a piece all that much we talk about Good Deeds I think his play style going to let him go to buy stevia that goes to the bottle and helped out Bang Theory go topside helped out someday limited to explain that is most wins to lie with the most rainfall but not the most played by The Rolling what is good I want to see that comes out here for who he is definitely really good at getting the side lengths ahead and I want to see what the style is 400 Seasons yeah I think they are going to be here in specially for mid lane going up against Bjergsen has been very outspoken about how deep his people is right now and how he feels like it's really really beneficial that you can play a lot of different already know we're starting out very quick guitar pick for 100 thieves getting forgot off the bat that is incredibly important hiding with stolen you're going through so they don't have to show anything curly Plus is good it's just I on display licorice in the very last game if they want to they could just see fall outfits and shoes that match a GSM do they want for themselves a very quickly do you sound very clearly playing for team fighting thing Broken Blade let's not put you in a deep breath. Which I think I can make sense that's what I would do as well if I was dict over here we have tacos gray much more Champions Leagues there was already in and that can still play for Sunday keep in mind that loosen that is going to bang yeah I've actually seen quite a lot of the Top Lane Victor still floating around even after the nerves plus this can also be a bottom Lane Victor and Lucien transition to a solo Lane don't forget about that because you can easily switch out these matchups as far as your age doesn't necessarily have to go do bang and I like the kind of Versatility here in the current fed up with these three pics whereas couple years ago you like okay well that's a hundred percent pure mids it's no longer the case would have to be scanned surprises I just kind of enjoy that overall than idea probably a little bit here as well as second band face coming out as 240 locked in a support for themselves they can easily Bantu away and not cancel the afro boot options I would be worried on him giving anything like thresh I feel like that's a good one to totally win Bollywood but also Rome top and get some inventors especially if you're Landing if you're dating Foreigner. Or Victor I think pretty deadly is Champion so we'll see what he isn't actually afraid of yeah the promise we saw also pretty good against Ezreal can nullify that new ultimates everyone's been loving so much black lot of Hope damage the other possibility there longer but you tried calling out that was wrong is gone goodbye in their 40s Ms a good signal that they want to get more of that long-range damage as well but even if you do estim drazba 200 C's Vance your the try to drop some of your exhaustion May chocolate at the table at Saunders has to be a gun as well still have to go down that was a little bit and maybe we'll see if he waits until the end of the draft to make sure he knows he's higher coffees against going to grab some Neil actually the best deal to get it so late in the draft to be a great throw the rest of jungle out good with Katie and most likely we were kind of talking about Acadian style jungler freaks what I was talking about you really aggressive possible Flav now you can expect the math very quickly redba your level to start getting into some active especially Victor that's a champion early on he had to be so careful of a Camille jungle does end up with the worry about their early phases well Rush does come through for aphromoo Nandita jungler now in this one what would you want to pick said you want to get something want to play as default think the front line the primary gate is a bit weak for the lights pretty strong is still available and has a strong early game as well I kind of like that in order to combat it early aggressive team again the hard engages really only impression that can work with an unreliable but if. Dominant Lanes down here thresh loosen the bot side Victor Borge I are both can be really good topping up against I on here and Olaf is considered the King of this one DSM didn't either until the bitter ends billion just Dustin dehart engage in Lexington KY back interesting last pick your 40 at them bringing in the Delian for pure and let's see the switch is going off for 100 thieves where will all three of these end up in a blood Victor definitely abused Scion start farming to whatever you want to take you back in the day it was ice-born Gauntlet in Abyssal mask I'm actually seeing more raw agility park with a champion now is that was some of the balcony just left face images I erase erasers what will be that the squishy scalable that's Ian and two together and actually kill it. But if something is not too hard and he gets off at the thought into the mid game stuff up quite a few more points in the laser as well so you get a bunch of ways control with it when you do try and stack AP and go that route it's going to be exciting hundred beans and TSM way back when the world stopped at least drop in a group that had to face against the world champions of the world finalists so rough group for them but they have the very best and TSM those deadly Mist world's entirely they grabbed two to three new flavors for the main roster and going to try it again here in this one if you get them definitely do look start that you have the talent I think they need to make that kind of run but that's the goals for that mess with TSM expect out of that roster going to be going back supposed to be good as well and we'll see this all happened over the next nine months either way to Great rock is great teen books get ourselves into the game all right Spain's first LCS game as well as Broken Blade let's see how they fare I'm sure they are feeling a bit of the pressure getting into it a bit let's see if we have any sort of early action for everyone standing out so far will have the defensive opening but the kind of comment Scuttle crab Awards how do I expand the early action being team chants for example an Olaf especially something like that also could have follow-up possible so you see you like a threat I want that more I'm looking for more than just a standard fan out you know just look for the standard Wards and try and use that really possible power undertow from Olaf is what makes him so crazy trippy ass back up level one he's a fully capable Champion repeatedly Appliance Lowe's and trying to look for First Blood what it really good and sort of obvious things that I like about six the new TSM coach that I think is very good at level one whether it's because you're getting good advice nurse analyst or what but ones were always very very good and evil ticket that was well there for a week or level one banana should really give up it's a good little one for now also a fully operational what the weight on the sinus headache Baxter Lane a little bit late the lane is going to push towards him someday already got a couple of here Sunday as well with this Victor going to be able to Stone Scion back into the brush should be able to get up and early goals need for himself and that could be a dangerous thing for you have something to be able to scale up on Victor then it could make the late game device very serious about talking about 480 heavy are you really have to worry about the damage later on all right now I just seen the jungle pathing come through and just mining away the big truck has the highest armor and it's all physical damage for Olaf's speed a little bit right there really gold go to such as easily as late as though pretty well we'll see how much I can get off this wave got a couple more Minions that kind of belonging to him but someday we'll see what comes through eyes that he's got a stack of gold I can see right now from his kleptomancy someday able to get that one off of side + 242 it looks like it's got some pretty good are in G on his side start so far looks like we're talking with Dierks about something going on his side will wait to see what that one ends up actually being on the zillion following up in the footsteps of fellow Danish mid laner Jensen he was doing really well Matt Champion the previous year otherwise you're not a terribly event will start to this game I am still going to be waiting to see what the the focus is 400 things again I feel like both top and bottom Lane can be places that you attacking and the right now just going for the power clear will wait to see we have to go to ya both that supports packing a lot of crowd control so that could be an action spot Top Lane Tazewell Victor can be killed really really effectively with a Camille side if they have access to their ultimate that all ended a long Lane is going to be something that someday has to navigate but what kind of the opening of the game when it really go over the jungle opening was actually pretty interesting to me where they both started on the top side you didn't expect it to me over there but a little bit worried about possible you know Camille invades later on she jumps on you and Olaf gets Low House Clearing jungle Camp right it can lead to early kills you know so if your lanes aren't giving you enough support I can be popped up and it first quickly and it immediately transition to the bottom side of the map to make sure he gets his cruggs and power clear through his red do both junglers are on the same side of the idiots just got the Scuttle crab in the river and it's actually a reverse clear now for end up moving back up and do it suicide as we speaking meals clear on the bottom side Scuttle top of the Aaron back to the game with only three hundred gold separating the team about Lake Michigan so far from being an afro movie thresh going to stay away from any Q's overall plan to eventually think instead of parsley playing a piece of land surface Kamil Baker something that's supposed to coming through and there really aren't any good words right now in that River they can't be a Katie coming in too easily yep and I actually just farming at the moment none of that truly submittal all the wards reveal with a scrying orb beach pass by and grab but he's clearing everything already anyway. Very quick Dill to get right through it and you can go back for the base after this pick up some food for the predator action and really threaten suburbs around someday but I do expect this to turn into anything this kind of a convenient recall here protects against possible early attacks all this Victor which definitely do what happens at some point in this pushing you to be there for your properties a little bit there an ice tray. Broken but getting some damage and still down a little bit of Cs but against all right ready-to-use flash it looks like if you can get a wall jump the extended range with Camille using her flashed but can't be enough to follow this guy walks into laying here going to be a bunch of the minion wave so that broke out here very good recall timing for him allowing him to help you push that waves get the minions in their favor and it's about a thousand gold here on the science of can't look at a catalyst but whatever or I like the help she said just as well would you go check the dragons anytime your jugular show chop sideburns is an Olaf at this age do you have to be worried about the enemy jungler or solo a dragon easily do it as soon as a dragon spawn so you have to keep eyes on that big and again and we can keep repeating the season that's the first dragons are very very beneficial yeah you know they did get that big buff so in Your Vision on it early once it does spawn is incredibly important all right well lanes All reset and it's still the 600 gold bead 200C uses so far as going to go visit the blue team coming in after a showing at Worlds their first year in the ALCS and they put together I think a super-team I really think the pick up a bank was huge and I think I do have high hopes for this year was definitely it often a lot of people were talking about Team Liquid of course cuz they were back-to-back Champion upgrading but a hundred thieves definitely be best bar none who organization into the league with franchising plates the best they also made similar upgrade as you said adding bang that's two time world champion all starts to the bottom side if Lucien we should grass very good combo for playmaking they actually make something happen. All this area that mad because already Acadian on the Camille get then you get this message boards behind
North America's strongest Regional team and Cloud 9 North America's strongest international team and it's going to be a fun one so our end of Noah really Allowed no contest also by the way. Junger supposed to have been watching the international Leaves aatrox play three or four lanes galio place to buy Alienware thing in the van face can be moved to so many different Lane and that's where some of the power comes from but a lot also comes from the champion kids at this time I call it also taken out you'll notice that most of these are Solo laners the carpet there is primarily jungle actually for when the first times I have actually seen the highest percentage now for Carthage is as a junglermid laner or support or anything like that first week of the LCS GLS is free work on Earth that's why he's been there and that does leave for the most ban Champions on the patch open freak and that's pretty big 12 times and fro does not really his style Castillo expecting him to be the one piloting it and of course a lot of our power did come from damage increases in a p h e r Snell especially on the Q and The W Max coming in very powerful here we go though in trade for that the hover on Earth. Which has been very popular vote Maderastop playing right now I didn't really have too many bad matchups we have seen some people really the only thing you can try and go to to take advantage of Lane would be arranged in like beIN or however dinner. Still always has a possibility of helping out a jongleur and all waiting and using your ultimate for executed in that situation has been sometimes it can be hard if you're a little confused it is a bit I'll keep my nuts DP play some Victor bought back at Worlds we seen first plays Zoey in the bot Lane so far this season so I still want to leave at 1 as an opportunity as well as it's more for the course in vent play throughout the end of last year especially at World impact on a tank and you have the rest of those players go for the carries in all of League of Legends andwhat is the Premier Times Square in North America that we know and Ezreal I think the most premier bottom Liners in League of Legends debatable which one's overall stronger but both you to be happy in a PowerPoint into a poke so 15 concedes very effectively forgot on the front line I can disengage fairly well you know he liked a cation ultimate and then try and get himself out of there while it's Zoe and Ezreal fish for bubbles and follow-up burst damage turrets you can really gain a lot if you can play together earlier onshow me watch NAA and world this is new Ezreal sensible Championship the rework came out the old no longer lose his damage going through talking to his sleep the lanthian about 1 so you can get a lot of damage and deep in the back line if you land outright Target alright second round of Banff a this was more interesting because we do have some pee stinks send out make an appearance beer jungle are on the current patch right now because early game is so important that we are going to have to broadcast as well so they should be down at what they said you wanted it would be very high up here as well as a special offense Team Liquid but there are often still in the paramedic you don't have to play kind of that tankey roll you can go for the lead bands in the closet style favored more of the stage 1-e you know any of the game of the 2019 season so far what climate is like at Worlds with a Nocturne band but that Alistair is still us-59 still very much is Forward Motion team do this poker timer leader of the Zoe and Ezreal so bit of a new-look but still Forward Motion Hare Alice Through the only primary game so far on C9 zeyzal you know a guy that they would talk about a lot as far as his shotgun link and communication again another one of these Academy players at Cloud 9 have built on and brought up to the LTS level down I will see what he's going against here breakable you can block everything from Israel and Zoe try not to laugh your teammates and they actually take it but the unbreakable unbreakable of how long with is a really flashy North America I think this man is truly incredible and he's on a fighter for the early game, Cloud 9 side was going to round out that team with the best choice girls already Max blowers playing at there for some of the Misfits game and now they're already built around this Pope combination was do in Israel and execute from forgot stuff just adding a little bit more peel in the Frontline Plus early on I can be a fairly effective zoning tool as well but here we go it looks like it's going to be Cloud Nine with his poke coming up against these standard Team Liquid they've got power very apt in the mid lane plus illusion prom for the bottom I so you might think that it's missing on this lease in and have a lot of agency around the bottom half of the map Lucan and Broad Niche for you for trying to look for early combo kills because I can fact that stuff so quickly and with a mobile just very likely that might be some fireworks tell me a few new players on my final let's get ourselves into our very first game it was a 2019 already I'm loving these new intros break a personality coming out everyone else is trash that is the goal for double of fear the privity can remain the best player in North American Dad just another title maybe a world champion tip obabys Team Liquid and Jensen here squaring off against his replacement already looks like actually expenses walked right up to Spence Karen in the the jungle. Remember it well this is bro play where everybody's looking for these early Scuttle Ward Wheat Thins should have the option for which side he wants to go to a little bit of an edge over the new never lie I can hear the crowd already did to it but you knows where it is a bypass later on if they're lucky about this one and we will get us all some various spots leasing shut himself in the top so that you will be indeed getting leased onto is my buff on the bottom pedal map Nuna going to be released for Dead Zone red as well so the same busting taken on a map yeah it's specially important because you want to be able to transition to drugs or the Raptors very quickly new new to take the towels mid-year You Can level up yours to snowball second so that you can get that are we hit down and it starts raining bike back from all of those multi targets are Imo's on dancers Raptors should be able to finish that one up and then look for the Scuttle with a biggest things with you knew by the way since the rework yes you know it's this big flashy stove Ali rolls and is going to come down you know cleaners think of but for me it's a deal on his Cube the consumed you can now use it on Champions and especially if you take the resolve runes you get increase healing when your lower that thing can really based people later on in team fights if he stays the consumed not using it for damaged ceiling people off guard so be careful little bit but we got to see the Scuttle crab straight back and forth in the blue box looks like as well Cloud 9 invested in those two River Wards spotted at 50 minutes to split these camps yeah you can see during the administration are so sad Battle of the amount of force and trying to keep up with the waves we're here but it does talk Cassiopeia a decent amount of Mana Hurley on which over it gets wax burn wood refinishing the Lamborghini just in time to fight things stand up gets an octopus watch down it's pretty important we'll see you at the Newgate comes Nico card games overall for now that money was supposed to go to the church statement of town at a Smithy and let's see how well they can fight for this month clean pick up for him there just finished off with that Jim bass Amazin to go over there though so don't harm no foul still everything pretty much equal between these two teams have split the masked as you talked about going on when to Scuttle side pain while in the mid lane pretty much even as well and then she's been able to find a barrier for his next phrase I don't want to use any of its Mana into one of those sprays to be considered as much as possible for weight management there is one small difference here in the jungle far as I can see is that I took some of the jungle on a very very small level partially one can I watch out for Portland right now really good start for done with your update Siesta many ways is not 8 minutes bigger so they have the nice in the way from thinking basil down here alright Douglas volume to the train station Counter support taking damage that's when sneaking can Arcane shift in goes for the office about would like my insides and the snow was coming down bowling Nicky's on the chase here but Nikki might be able to go where God had just won the gate by on topside sup did not want to continue to chase into the enemy's territory but with the biggest snowball ever spend scared able to land at haunted impact where is liquid had burned the flash onesie one earlier and open up that possibility figure wondering about that dude is gay comes head up if your lender is able to flow The Flash by themselves obviously our got into Scion is our God Favored I get to use that range advantage and try and harass him early but licorice coming straight out of world's semi-finals for himself definitely a huge player for the scene flashes on impact gets thrown over shoulder and in fact there's no speaking ability left in Zion Chipmunks and flashes blown so allows for an easy snowballs Poulan turn on the Middle Lane right now put the control board on CC get spotted directly but sort of kind of is going to speak with the New Black old man either and just a black eye to round for the only the 172 spell push them away out of here Cloud Nine types of gold lead as well as the hell's lease space continuum svenskeren Now using this moment to go in heat warning up the blue side of the map I think it see what this Vision Taco he's going to use it feel to drop go to the flash in the pan treutlen that could have been huge but it's time
welcome to Champion Select for the spinal semi-final of Worlds 2018 I am so freaking with Kobe and officio fnatic vs Cloud9 for the last spot in the finals of the biggest n Avers to you match property of all time it is extremely exciting first pick up and face and wearing some pics on both sides people looking at it really ought call different states at same here in the semi-finals and then Dillion Nocturne 2 of this key picks for top nine something else we're looking at with Cloud 9 games what's the difference between group stages early on for sneaky and then once he started playing Lucien in the bottom way since we're looking at Mark Smith is already be another one that did rise to the top because we can do something very different and interesting pick right here by fanatic hoody entirety of the main stage of the world image of Cloud 9 has always band Tom tent it's such a good counter to their aggressive StyleX gear not at world only to the summer split open now it is in a blank space pick we saw this yesterday in game three between i g and G2 it simply saying we are so confident and I'll mid laner and whatever mashup we going to get in this Lane that we will be able to play around Tulane that we can just grab it early on plus it just re-emphasizes what we are talking about with the mid laners and junglers important put on these four players they've already invested very early on Fanatics the midnight fix but your Cloud 9 invest into the jungle by Raton from fanatic I assumed was seeing if they were not take away the braimport finds web also showed us because the star of the top way there and the scores of solo queue for many it's so annoying to play again because of the rain messed up what is a blind Victor so he didn't know already that he's going into a tankie champion and you're something easy to use kleptomancy again he's actually confident up to your nipples going to get licorice that it could be blind yeah I want to see if teams have been the last couple days find encounters to Victor give us blind bags for liquor stores have a chance to last pic also want to see now playing Bossa combo is used in Florida am I the best strategy so far vs. Victor has been in early pics I can set up your jugular four gang key they already have a Sims out jungle for possible early Gang Kill Victor before he gets the cooldown reduction and the upgrade for his text core weldernow is a Finchley Premier bottling take right here the unassuming Jackson Jungle Band or maybe it's Christmas to me earlier because obviously we've got LeBlanc and Victor playing Phil not a major Spock player does. He's very good into it and I was not really a lot of thinking from last year's season wasn't bad and the Cassandra can oppose get flex but I want to see Sandy Old Town of akin to Victor let's hearcould also be a mid lane Echo and shifting love walk up to the tops died and farm it out and then use that was how to actually settle after this Lobster around twenty-second group I'll remain up in the air telling me about this is going to be the kind of think it's going to happen. Okay let's see if anyone will actually do it tonight I'll have to swap it around but they have 15 seconds even the chance the players flop around as well we've seen Timur like before as well as the other lane Golf Course AP damage and what are the items that Victor top weight has been brushing aside for solid because of the large amount of cooldown reduction and Mana help with the shield and the speed with off your queue nowgoing to be an alteration to build a little bit and you get Abyssal mask in the case of magic damage instead was not quite as perfect as not going to be as damaging you almost never be in the orange hat cogo xin'an use the pope movie select is Scott moir new and exciting pics the blind Victor the echo top it's going to be an exciting game a very fun graph to watch and the last remaining hope that the two major western region Europe on the left North America on the right ventricle to the love is gonethe game has begunwelcome to summoner's Rift Europe versus North America semifinals at Worlds the best performance either reasonable has had seven years if you can make it to the final here so much building up to this match and we're now in the last few seconds or you can expand the EU of a day and chat because it is about to catch on fire I mean one region will make it to the world final your the region will get trash talk for a year so a lot on the line here for both fan bases and solutions for the Victor when it comes to his atomization because we got to see the iPhone going to brush when he was against sings Like A trucks and the armor was super beneficial hard for it looks to kill him obviously not going to be the same effect against an echo and this constant threat that you can jump you with a jumper and you can always close that Gap and get on to you exactly that's the key thing for me because Victor top actually does a lot of scaling but we'll talk about that later because there's already an invade here that's been seen quartz rocks is going to back off until his bottom Lane does comes and Beyond don't know they were spotted at 3 didn't see the ward that medic put down into the left hand side could not be swept out a lot of really wishes on both ends here is there still battling now for the Red Bluff three-on-three down here to wait this way to get to defrost it going to give up the control as Liquors nobody but when the topside the Q canal and fit more damage as well speak not off to a good early start getting his passive there for the extra speed now the big difference on this invade is the midline or push Jensen in the Midland as Alessandra he pushed away that was not on screen but he got control over the Midland hair priority is what we call it and cats could not join so they had to give up that but I like this. How about from C9 actually happen against fanatic when they play in the quarterfinals in the first game from support always leads the way here now has a wart spotting since Karen so he knows he's on his way into his jungle is it taking the long Route Around Redbox and see how you do not especially with the soul Elaine's getting the push on the minion waves that we have seen that was actually going for the gank rather than the Scuttle crab right now getting of whip and want to get that income going already brought that you can see his transition that's the bottom side already on lease in and he may just have to focus on that area as there is a lot of fish in there either their division I wrestling fanatic on desktop site the Goldsboro that had a warden the wrath of Sparta Cent gun walking into the jungle and Waco had a ward in the Top Lane try brush it with a spot in his balls out as well so they knew okay if he's not in any of these places to eat fairly easy to track the jungle the first part time from Jensen and it gets hit all my God I want to set up great play there from Captain place to get that's why we put the importance on the mid jungle Duos here in this matchup flashing in securing that kill and getting the Summoner spells down in half of all of Cloud 9 games with the Enemy mid laner giving up first Blood of all 10 players the map fanatic at 3 minutes turned you want to start the animation of not able to react in time either way I could play right there and this is the fourth a good start 654 fanatic is betrayed keep having to the topside and I got to say it's been pretty good for a liquor shop at liquor to me having a counterfeit so far to that first pic Victor yet what the biscuit delivery as well does going to come in to help him sustained through that they keep up the pressure house with top Victor as well it's very boring to keep track of the room choices even if you are forced to go in the magic resistance area you can take Transcendence for some cooldown reduction at levels had but again it still takes a while to scale up on that dick Korra comes extremely effective bottom line now they're going in for a little bit betrayed level of play but either way I hope I'm not getting punished for being jumped in at all and that's going to be pretty equal for this bottling is plus vs fnatic either he gets all three of these he will still be down turn face in I did not value. Lucia in the first place that they wanted lisandra against the law to pick from fanatic which meant the times for bad Lucian and therefore not be too scared of the wrong lane specific kind of things from the grandpa and subtract using the series if seen on Parklane feel like they need more pressure for the next game they might value getting that Lucien piccard earlier but for now it is a scalene picks for sneaky same thing of you for reckless and that investment has worked out pretty well as far as the Cs Lee there or lesandro but again to teleport was also close to going it again in the landing feel pretty safe rocks won't take that 1:40 till he gets out because of an extra damage Jensen maybe going over too far forward to mount 1/4 can use it offensively stay alive feel like middle and it's where everything is happening and we showed this in the free game how cold to Atlanta pick up a bunch of quite a bit love to cancel Merlin pronounce fanatic it has been all broxah for the early game you know Spencer and went for the invite to push him off of his jungle Camp you went mid instead and got a lot out of it are you kidding me bottomley want to say something about it but just jumped over the walls are Spence Karen goes headlong into the gym here to just run away from a type of the first successful that seem like some frustration in our age of Predator replay addict level 6 is for both of these guys Ripple does GetGo the sun over there and he's able to get it back to get to flash out of the Stars most important here he's just running away from its nest cam does Cam get in and get enough hits on him be well Captain Brock set in stain he threaded that came through and was able to land it on the liquor it but the girls had already blown his ultimate in the attempted killing with photo shoot shoot early momentum here for the 1500 gold leave for the EU LCS sweethearts hear the last remaining hope for the EU LCS and they are looking very good so far now to find them at length we fight they take in mid or Top Lane a weave in and out of Minion waves they always get on to the correct Target and they just have enough damage to finish C9 Jensen ends up going down a little tray to feed Liquors walking back to list David Stanley this one again take away is licorice but never does he do for damaged and now he's just talked about 1/3 HP and not to mention to plot of my hero skills are going on the top side of the map in Midland in top way in the jungle as well but bottom line actually have we behind its yes because the zipper keeps pushing topside again do rocks and moved up he's going to provide some extra support forth with undercurrent now the echo not a lot of options and you saw that incident on Aging spinster and unwilling to fight rocks in the one-on-one better items by completed p.m. after this long for the 150 acres going for a bit lower the shield there will not be a re-engage Whipple playing so well with all this pressure 1 0 and 1 despite a partial Camp has been staring thing process control water with him after shock plus all the bills Atlantic City
it's the primary assassin that Justin has used Not only was it well used bike apps but it was also a take away from Cloud 9 value their yard of the traffic to have Team switching sides of these bands look very much the same as last time to go and we'll go to Cloud Nine pans or fanatic or more triple band thrown at caps last possible flexfix there and that is a lot of respect from his Pulpit Victor corces there as a potential come to pick against a person has the first pick for guywhy won't be a quarterback from Flex take her the counter pink eye should say is there for Cloud 9 as well without words that happened with you and I want to do a lot of us grew the Cup champions are still available and we'll see what comes through all right what day does very well is mobility and Mobility has been incredibly important so far did tournament for Conway's on the last game where was there a head lightning quick and gauges and that made it very very easy for the answers to get fixing for suffice across the map so if they do get a lead this has been very big for Hellertown value st.joe here on the fanatic side and take that away from Sin Cara no visitation last game it wasn't that scary but it is still considered the best early-game Lumber in the professional see from Lucien I want to get that from Portland after taking now I would also think about taking me the other side of the match of their Spence Terence least then we haven't seen it that much but it has been a pic that he has also been very good on and does have those options as far as the extra ability to try and work away from the sin and the HR selling at Toppenish ergot for themselves and only played at once here for Whipple and a bandit more than half of their game so not a champion Steely Dan ever willing to play or all that practice price of this is actually a fairly spaced curious what other kind of bow has is Swain is still up for example if I'm very curious what he will play here he also Jungle by to ask for Lisa and I would also love to see it's listening but it is going to be the greatest Victory to use in a quarter-final against the freak after you have for 59 to Victoria Banana Foster great flocking to the Jungle usually packed like that yesterday at the cooldown reduction Grace also scaling but here we go early game very very scary and use of the champion. We'll see if Anna could do the same and the Korean Chinese Jason really good we'll see what the damage or Belgian I believe Jace is like your phonetic way to go through this one doubt from Reckless it's still too cuz I have been so far for the combination of a way to see what else comes through another draft the same deal because they need an area of the map that isn't a losing laying it doesn't have to scale-up you cannot have all scaling you seen this tournament you just get absolutely run over in the early game somewhere that is pushing Lane to try and play off of so you don't lose all of this will check this early on is going and Jason against that a truck if you didn't work yesterday just so heavily favored to Jay's no surprise here for fanatic with severe they can still race with the last pic with those types of matchup you kind of need a jongleur that brings crowd control if you want to try and kill the alleviate some of that pressure and that is not the case here so once again fanatic looking pretty strong as far as the opening of their draft for two at 59 will respond to with the bottom Lane well another one I do know it's Binky plays a lot of Victor when he does play other lane when you have to play with my display the champion of swapping is around 2 but it could be damaging his ear is certainly the Emperor of that is kept in the mid lane Wendy early game but the coaches long rain makes him a very safe and then he gets to his team Friday station to items and becomes a Power House of Night and I think Elaine face looks very good with them has the range advantage over a Chach you can harass them then you dropped into the brush up on top side to drop the minion aggro as you're also can outrange but Sondra the only thing is he has to worry about you see all Limbs and it looks like he's taking cleanse there to try and get out of this game but in the bottom lane from C9 Victor coming in from sneaky Leona from Victor purse with the engage from the Leona and his exterior to her she will get to the Target and if you waste your Shield actor gets done and you're going to get Frost it down very quickly play music on stream but now at World in the semi-finals the Victor Leona Lane for the bottom will this be the surprise card that cloud 9 need to get back into the series and will it be the comeback that North American fans and 59 and cells are hoping for in this one fanatic handling themselves drop game 1 and b e d g G2 in the quarterfinals drop game 1 2 orange and still won that series as well this lights Howell not close those games where is from now on the summoner's rift I am definitely going to have my eyes on Brockton looking for some aggressive passive passing here from the gym. How to maybe even split the top side of the map in France secure some area for with O to work with whippo is a very aggressive top laner always looking for trades and wants to be able to get abused it said see my right I agree with you will be look at the bottom line from C9 and they speak to pick the grabbit early we saw last game with the plane but they didn't move it to that topside I want to see the connection with Liliana here to kill pressure that going to have with a night as well and Azazel it's a lot early game damage just from the support of long and already there are differences here you can see with Stinky's room choice you say Canary for trading in the bottom side of the map not the kleptomancy that we see for the top side trying to form up there that's definitely makes a lot of sense he also has domination usually I can't see the domination runes but usually you'll get Taste of blood types of ravenous Hunter 4 and that is for sustained in late is Jensen's lissandra he was really good at getting away from those games before we'll see the attempt once again here is licorice and Whipple get to their Lanes in the Bellator fights as well stop the bottom side the end up with a truck vs. Jace Lane could be a difference between different I've seen a lot of Western gate for your struggle in the past Backpage snowball game I can prove everyone wrong and say that he has extra practice is enough to Heart win this match because it was a good laying for him and he not done so well in that what you want it if I can go anywhere close to that I'm pretty sure I can really show Liquors what's up and in game one that was true maybe some jungle help with the bot laners fight will do the game looks like in the topping matches well yeah I was going to stay put. Definitely has the right mentality for it as far as being very aggressive pushing in licorice zoning him off the minion wave beer and trying to use his shot glasses and an extra bit of damage liquor still looking for maybe the Long Key on minions arranged so still that is advantageous to The Fanatic topside and the way will slowly push for clicker she will gain exp not zone out of this but advantages to go to Fanatics I'd bring hard CC like a lot of Douglas licorice can actually set it up and there is a possibility I don't sing at the super likely bottom side though it's raining very heavily so that might be the area a juggler see Gravity Force intrusive as a pre level 3 fight right there when 3 comes through the fight happen to stop by to help actually that people might lose but whatever the setup is from Zazzle makassar really twins around nicely and I like that Houston is what you're trying to do was Reckless of this household knew that was going to happen at your house out of bricks so always mine games in the bottom line when you got a bit of damage that was basically it but the gates and licorice is trying its best you just match far he's slightly down Spurs game showing in space up there was there's so many minions it for the trait is trying to buy licorice time to get some last hits there in front of people in the mid lane again exchanged going pretty heavily in favor of the damage for here at ever Matic what goes to licorice yes I can pretty solid there in that top 5 we know that rocks that is nearby and can come through if he's needed alright so first race we got the two liquids that you wind up if they were supposed to go on Manitou had it before you will go back and used TP to lay most likely you won't admit it be hot out of it the last pick was Sandra like long-range hope this is so effective if you want to threaten you properly and that's why I sent request an attack on you was here but that's also why you see they teleport to lasondra and Jensen has been forced out already and that's the reason that why you staying even in CS right now but has already used his first teleport back to Lane after he was forced out there by the harassment of his ears long-range I want to see you soon and maybe go for a fly in the ointment side do enforce the cleanse out early from Cops then try again at 6 maybe while how far is still low and has Kim have an itchy trigger finger to make sure we can stay safe Urban farming Peak to Warsaw flight from sense Karen we're kind of waiting for Brookside to pull the trigger first because I going to send our love to just say okay don't thank them for like 10 minutes 45 seconds grandson was going so far okay if match pretty similar on the recalls there and The Division coming out for rocks outside going to be spotted out now my son as well as recalling so spent trying to get there in time but does a good job killing the Scuttle crab so quickly but don't know he's there and that was with both of bottom land and the Midland having Rolex founded influenza saved to be enough by itself to running back to the lake with already in the jungle wouldn't need a few 2/3 or not but the moment they still showed up he knew okay you can. Last year to prune an early advantage in the jungle matchup and that could be important. Whipple's Mater from just permit pushing his top scientists will need help as we can see right away at at Sun Circle in the game overall as a position 100 goalie for finocchiaro liberal-leaning says most fat being done in the top five eleven CS difference that explains a showing his experience on this Victor pick even though not too much in the bottom side of the map as you said it was really important that Reckless positions far away from hylissang for they get the max distance outside of the gravity field there to avoid that chain see that you were talking about earlier freak we will most likely see when they actually go for another or later but they try and get onto the Civil but she cannot dash out of the starting from Victor Damone when she get to see cheetahs long as they told ya she has the advantage because you should quit animation and if it managed to do that breakfast will be standin played for quite a while and that's enough to kill him but for now he's playing very safe also doing presents for cloud nine is allowed Spence Karen to move in and take control of the river around Dragon actually do it but they don't have any Vision on the positioning of spend hours that there's no Seaport in this game and it's going to help ring around a possible dive or counter gank hear from the bottom line New Orleans it's still way to Blue Bell Stables sunroom up and help him as well and often. what's early on this Hartford to do a whole lot again to Victor and Leona so right now it's just a battle against the clock almost went but I didn't know if benchley they will get die if they will get you in a gang by ICP
and if not I hope to lock their spot in the final four 830 Suite of Cloud 9 let's see here Fanatic sticking to the same bands was Billy and Norton Alice rc9 again a collie irelia and it take away the pain that was perfect by fanatics it really does seem like a caps here at the Natick with the extra hand as far as the Assassins Midway give him a doll with a defensive wrong and victim was not take buy C9 as an answer it in the bottom Lane Connecticut and Angels, fix that we've seen a lot in phone as well as well as I like the sanitation department Havelock in the Lucian the first base finally was consistently band away and it's the only goal is the allister this is what they wanted to play it's what led to a lot of victory in the afreeca 309 18 and 1/2 that back to the power they really want in the bottom lamp open the first game and brought over DeWalt fanatic with. Elaine possibly walked in here and I take rocks can be shifted to the Jungle but likely Bozzo lanes blocked in where is 594 Jensen licorice has a deeper champion pool feels like more answers then Jensen has mad as far as the mid lane goes maybe they want to jump on something quite as many play over and over here right now do we get a tank top from a Christian and she has been as far as if you're looking for a tank answer and that is another one that they could go with but yeah there to listen to they want to lock in forged incident over and over again and I can I come through for fanatical Reckless on another hide image DMV and he was a big Force than previous game you can have a decent chance of here and Rec. During this final what could be the final damaged say I left my photo series at least your power yoga burst damage as well as a single Target knock up there now and you can go for more creative jungle gang since we're the ones where you'll see going over walls behind do a lane or top laners diesel okay and then go round 2 on the echo top the face up with the SUV fix her up there and it seems very likely this is going to be in 51 Whipple had his way with licorice you might also see these Champions switch roles has the bus to go back and forth I'm going to be interesting to see which player if it is the echo vs Vick the top and make it a bit more jungle attention to what first Jensen had a famous Echo miss out before they going to get it or Licorice and it is that Echo and Victor locked into the top laners go to the top not a guarantee that this matchup payment from Prince Gareth ended up backfiring he died also after rocks ahead already going to be late as well so junglers a huge amount of weight on their shoulders in influence the early Lane pay for the seller Lanes in which one of these guys can actually take over the game it's going to be an exciting one here Cloud Nine sacks against the wall that one coming in as the hole for the West European Champions they were the ones people had pegged as the Dark Horse to make the Deep Run and they have three in a row now to make it to the final the first time you're done that at all against the team but they had beaten in the Invictus so much confidence so far they have been a far better team compared to see 9 and we'll see if I can do it here Cloud I must make this three in a row over the wall early on as they can sneak in behind anyone my pee is a soul sitting in this with Russia and he's waiting on his cool down right now straight line of anticipation for the prompt you a dustland so therefore accuracy would you have a defensive for a while but that is about it everybody after sing happy to back off and just be normal red stars for both junglers but we'll see about the passing as far as which lane they want to influence first it right now for Natick were protecting for the level 1 and base it actually happened also and came on Wednesdays will have to throw him and he walked in and forced blocks away from the Red Bluff get to take his own blue on top side and giving her the advantage over to see now but not this time so I guess the best odd possible with a giant Leisure grow from Richmond Hill a thing as well that's the word Rock was in the middle of my brain as well as three autos on the way out go to almost given up that help trade I think and the right back at the start of winter anyway it's slightly in his favor Spencer actually started the sweeper here I've been trying to take down this Scuttle words before he moved over to the top side of the map is this time around kind of like we set up and game number one of the options were just going to try and split the map here and close off the top side in that to allow licorice is solo 1 V1 time in this match of the really trying display the Fon to Victor on the top side will go and grab his own bump on the bottom side of love to do this like red bump into a ham always watching for signs of objectivity away that we can help but not a summer spell as a very aggressive Frank out of Brock send the whole lot for it besides they go past four visits and Peridot making another fast lyrics just in case set him up though and broxah will be able to chase down when he pulls out of the jungles fence guy coming back secure his own right side with the Midland pushing against fanatic wedding it would have been pretty slow here but first game with the flash on fixing pull from fanatic and the rest I take the big surprise so far so good for him still has a bunch of broken coaching staff as well. Phil had his post to the Layman TalkBack checking in on the bottom line here Lucian bromwick freaking freaks for a lot of bottom Lane presence has been able to push in but Reckless and he'll saying doing just fine in CS there actually a head and a couple extra minions might be able to text right back up 40 Glen down here not a huge surprise just yet we're going to wait to see if the Big E wrestler places them in a classic rock to make it a lot more, 59 squat so what about play walk into the feathers right behind them with to call back right they're able to the spring the Trap takedown sneaky and a fire first blood for Fanatics see you to set up again why is it such a big problem now because this was the big change for you and the draft we've seen the echo already miss alisandra what solution pick in the first face it was always the second phase grabs it this time around and now he's losing YouTube Reckless Landing snare on to him or fanatic way more than just the first Blood itself to across-the-board a great start here for the EU LCS Championship victories over in Europe they lived in the shadow for quite a while but a couple of Victories here he looks like during the roster this number on Whipple is well in this year and it's been a very good run now winning in their official last game in the semifinals cat is Stephanie been the best way to bounce back and become the number one team in Europe to come to power house again that every European pain always look towards but it came out to International performances fanatic a bunch of everything right in 2018 Reckless has talked a lot about it and so in interviews as well I'm about his confidence in Houston this time around just feel like they're firing on all cylinders Cloud 9 fire around mid lane in Greece Jump Around tab the chairs on the wards they do the playoff they find the Ruby my cat has opened up that he will be in about 1839 went behind the near the game once again look to work MIT when Karen and brushes at least 30 seconds waiting Play Just A Pose Acro cats only a 300-hp has it on flash of course keep in mind around he's sitting with the team now on the top right of old stuff you can respect everything else if you go back to the trade you could have a couple more fights that was real cool. Sorry take that back and heard it in a fryer price of whippo get liquor going to be loved and liquor out TP is going to stay low in this Lane always tell if there's no ghost following you next time say spectator park that's that's on me I'm a better player than I normally I'm just rusty or terrible or something else who knows either way 600 goal difference in Cloud 9 L look at the bottom side with walking through it it's pretty easy brought the back off if they stay here from the draft with their Lucien Brougham some attention to work this Lane and see if they can I should push it and potential Tower die or just take the turret it is the first color by number to Reckless but we see the lot of pressure around bottom side wolf Houston free big reward then the night away regardless but it is money being lost the map right now to the pressure it's not a Killa but it's several hundred gold lost all the same potential moving down there is no CC from Jensen before speaking on our way even cash sitting in a broadsheet hiding out of vision he knows he doesn't need to work although he just needs to have the chance to call that he's missing from Midway wash out the cell phone for just about his healing is cut in half to re-engage will take some dance pretty quickly as well as coming off rude. But all Lanes at the moment trying to keep fanatic bottled up and force them into more expensive place hours has the little bit of success purely on is all the vision control in the river is on cloud nine side Table Rock Lake Forest mettawa play table to find the kill here and now they can put out the Top Lane this is going to completely cure for fanatic MattyB can't rejoin us a really good thing there for the EU LCS Champions 900 gold ahead when it across the map in or even bought me looks pretty solid exact time through our names to keep the pressure going in the early games they even have to brush to blow a splash on the first gang and not get anything for it with Intel Jones Farm Lane Boy by the trailers and now we're at the GameStop side from branka to give them a kill maggots is completely getting ahead of his game definitely respect you but I was laughing today setting themselves up looking towards IG and house dominating they were in their semi-final a lot of hype that's where the possible final matchup between those two teams and it does look fanatic Savory butter does not out-of-reach just yet I do want to keep ourselves on what sealant can do so far in this game only a thousand apartment for the break-in bridge that got really close as far as I'm concerned and it seems to be a pretty free pick up here as well so I think we are up in Arms Reach here in game 3 by mind force must make a reverse sweep three in a row and that is a prayer for everyone North American sayings during the Phoenix players themselves this series
100 thieves lost in game 5 to Cloud 9 EG lacity liquid exactly there is no update here either team win notes nobody's going to be surprised so let's get right into the pig banned because when it is disclosed it matters a lot and there are touching on the top line in the Army I don't know what are the differences between the two top laner top winners has been dust far the Jack scary pic for someday and four hundred thieves the impact has not picked up again even though he has a world winning skins on the champions We haven't actually seen him play it and actually seen him carry top sites accept on the redacted I'm still looking at here or the bad bass there it is okay good they go for the redacted instead of doing the Whittle down on the jungle good job Tony I think he'sto the right places here at Versus Evil Genius test even though it does leave open of jungle auction all right and one of those is Olaf right now or do we have to get more lifestyle Deluxe overall healing and it was just fine and if they let time take down double sided fence guys going to take it after all yes we had a couple of jungle bands and case it's obviously also a stellar performer like we said let the robots this year for Jungle position you kind of want to determine do you need engage can you go with a AP carry like Billy or something what are your solo laners going to be to try play off of what type of jungle Champions choosing hear through there is a good all-around thick does AP damage but it's mostly Tanki mostly good Frontline mostly engaged neutral objective and power clearing playing really well off when it lands I would say definitely dispatch11.3 rock that would really hurts though it's fine for now in the ALCS until we get to Live Match Kodi lauriana great combination we saw it already in the last game we're already today excuse me but you know obviously hextech ultimatum it's shockwaves is always great to Champion Terry and signals a lot of options in fight with that and you can push with the Camille Saint of the day seraphine Tyrell was kind of Talk of the Town With the flak Westwind but the stamp go through it is not highly prized Deere 4230 use it mostly went through in the previous game there as well with be looking in the Mortal self instead we've gotten our gravis or answer to Camille that can be a tough 1/4 impact Camille's all in is really strong but there is game played Buffy with Megan are down there and did you gave his only has been great he knows that the Oriana down there in mid and if I don't doubt it would be locked itopen to Oriana because Oriana excels in the Midfield and she can outrange it has beer is a similar idea when you're playing at the Oriana azir does have pretty good wave clear as well as far as protecting that if you're looking at the overall composition Since U G didn't have no desire to go more poke it looks like and fishing with bubbles this is a very standard are we to fight for them and I know it is super controversial picking picking our whether it's in to Camille or whether it's applied in fact is one of the top winners that I actually do have confidence in him playing around the weaknesses well it is mini form is very careful does just no seais with a boomerang that doesn't overcome it to some of those shorter autosmeanwhile the other tells fan to get locked in 200 East Side I want to say is that closed there's a lot more than any other jungler weather for his laptop he just wants to play it on this so often and major carry for the team just overall I'm going to look at that jungle kill stats right now and let me hear ya up near the very top 40 to Kings Cross 11 games as second place to only blabber who's played four games that himself really is a big killer he's he's a really big deal here the Olaf and he doesn't support right he's got a code with the Camille and the Oriana alongside for for the help yeah I mean honestly I've always loves any sports beat up like you're mentioning dive buddies + supportive in a Solo laners for the RR just what he wants now is going to have more dive buddy I'm just needs of also excelled free at their coordinated power. They're very good or have been very good at setting upfor their Matt place in advanced calling their rotation and then executing on these Dives the one I would say that got caught in the throat was versus Cloud9 game 3 they're about to win the series they can feel it they have an early-game advantage and they died Vuitton kente bottom way they give up three kills the attire so come and get this I had it in my mind I was wondering C reverse weave permanently damage types of Thieves doesn't look like it there if they actually clean we pull them off this time around because that's always going to be in the back of your mind when you get reverse whip like that in the series you feel like you should have one of you you might be 2nd ST guessing, that I've definitely don't go you know throwing people three people at a Time cast to get her but there's nothing this game you have some pretty goodafterwards a zero with a shuffle can be really solid but he's all right there locking in or around FBI or dive in and just cause 4 SAFE backline Act or I should say not much active for him he's not exactly terribly mobile but I can definitely come down to it to be good at cutting or the year for the most part will be kind of okay at it support but will be fun to walk for easy certainly a very Dynamic team here as well we know with the sooner you get that things up the Adair cell phones that work on engages fight and I think both of Elias and Zion have very good consistent damage to back things up yeah I actually really like the Ziah point because this is always a champion that I'm looking at even even in times where she's not in the met at all heard the counter dive is so good you know that ultimate alone saving you from stoveany spots we were we were talking about The Misfortune lost its ESFJ we're like what you do and the Camille is on the rift once again so good adaptation there we saw how the Camille destroys immobile carries in that opening a game of the day definitely going to be more difficult this time around I can obviously still do it against a zero as I it's just that I really like your point about the yourself peel for both those Champion for the backline does make you more confident in this five-on-five when you're facing stuff like cut me Olaf a lot are you in the back by anything so you do want to find a way to get out despite those things you can talk with the TSM game it was fly poop poop Banda ways I don't want to let lost have any fun so you can't play the championand definitely the Clayton band me out so I'm going to go for that champion Thai diver going to be there and we'll see if you can survive these Place indeed headed to use are going for some she can play stop site shouldn't be much a pack is no reason to go back but it can also mean they can look for the 130 engage the topside go take a blubaugh and enforce vertical jungling as you see it offensive words from a coup he actually it's from FBI is going to spot out when when steering goes for his own blue take but if we are here exactly it's so coordinated from hunted these and this is something that when when it was announced know who he and the rest of the Guardians are are joining up with six Tony on 100 thieves I I was really excited because those were some of the times in the ALCS that old CLG with sticks and who he that had some of the craziest level 1 the craziest Rome plays early on in games coming in always with a pre-set plan and this one is is very simple topside delayed invade for closerstop taking away power clearing versus another Power clear jungle with a defensive word on their own blue as you pointed out to see their reactions there from Spence care now it's been staring does far on Udyr doesn't have any extra information is just doing the full red quartz and clear and Olaf vs. Udyr it's basically a bodybuilding contest who gets more jacked more quickly because then you take over to my tastes are too heavily those closer has gone over that work as you mentioned the things start to go down and he's going to have to cross if you want the defendant and pull off the three quadrant hear ya applecross the Nokia closer was not spotted until just vanity cross the river there was a ward ultimately yeah could have looked at me as being pressured ignores you to help make sure it's been staring as safe as a cell taken down as far as blooms really make sure that looks safe as well they check Try by Stacey allaster but clothes are was going to show up anywaywhy did you wait this long to make the play the kind of bad allowed to be there by 8. There as well but your cousin species of erised it's not going to be closer comes in a way too late to have a task and it's the way first what do that was rough I I really thought they had this whole thing set up but stopping over okay so this one who throws axe for revision it doesn't hit you can't pick it up so there's no way you can you can actually win this fight it. Does it have accident then he can't actually take Hooter and then went to cool down comes back it's too late to try to get the doc up combo for closer but without that extra damage at the at the beginning with the accident in the ground there it's it's going to be a huge swinging bodybuilding contest sweats Garrett Rd Flexin swole broFirst Blood this is way better with the hoodie Aaron in backed impact looks pretty good. He did they close or combo went well against him in a flash flood in Arkansas to be a repeat Target so stay tuned for this one worth noting do the Boss by jungle foreclosure is still up wolves and prop still available and if you want to go to that side after the scrubs argon flow gauge my plate off overall in 1/4 of a nicely Tracy Stevia paleo then go back to deciliters never going to be enough damage to do anything but that was nicely done nice try by who he doesn't mean much though back to the Jungle do the other big problem with that play is that it delays and you're playing for this timing window where a a triple quadrant control the jungle early on can really delay your opponent but only if you're able to deny them that extra 30 seconds while they have no camps to farm but cancer only two minutes to respond so if you have extra mission the jungle you go down in the one we won you give over the kill it actually doesn't matter at all because it's been scanned still gets to go reform is topside I can come right here in front of you in the second time in a row sister has it kill donated right in his left hand turn to know Toll Brothers really rising up and is going to be an objective here at 400 these though as a closer is able to take down the dragon during the mid killflash traded for Flash that actually might go cop something later but we just had a very nice level leave now here for Spence Karen despite not having flash East should be able to tabouli I was going to say though with the short response of if again you know something happens like that and you're early game goes Haywire then the camp to Tanner jungle just respond anyway so they're just going to be higher level there for her crop and wolves in that's been scanned got to pick up right where you left off that's why he had jumped out to that level lead over closer I do like the early Dragon do 400 thieves let's see if they have bottom line control as well ignore for the dash backwards but still some good damage over, be careful though it's been scaring them away over a good Lord sees that you should be safe sleeper comes out get 10 gold but now the thieves Note 8 we just Bots I have to be careful overcenter this one as a ganar can always flash take me to set it up FBI going to feel safe has flashing you'll himself a mate fighting a war to do to help me go and spend staring to get another Scuttle in a row so a lot of control around right now even if not get to heal back up think somebody fruit and eat I feel pretty comfortable down here on the bottom side x class at Edwards definitely good flash away. To re-engage is so much damn who he is and I don't know who he is down what if you don't plan to ignore it's actually death on your screen flashes then, without any effort at all those back the blades who he my goodness this EG bottom light has been one that has shown up and okay closest going to try and reap the rewards no flash on definitely say go for me look at me please hit me I'll jump back to my team and is just not enough that we wasn't slow and there's too much threat back of the FBI with the wave there so no. 2000 Gold Cup winning basically everywhere this a little bit more about the EG bottom line because it has been one of the super pleasant surprises of this year I E G coming together and having such a strong showing in walk-in was in in no small part due to both of these players definitely playing a lot better than people thought it. Are still getting off a lot of good romance while also lady nicely with them that being said currently not a great look getting awfully zoned off the towers FBI takes time to replayed after to reply to your on the afilia they're worried about to dive and he's got no flash and he had not had access to his level six until rejoining this way than getting his experience there FBI going to go in on him a possibility that God had flash but with The Bodyguard of who he
a very good draft beer on a to be able to set themselves up for success in a team that has been pretty intelligent as far as the drafting goes into in North America we have seen a time with them they need opponents need to take gate consequently things like the swing that has been discussed with him in the past I think they're going to need that they're also going to need a very good performance out of solo who I think has been performing much below his level at Worlds you know I did not expect him to get abused in the way that he has been he's been making some unforced errors making some mistakes I think that he is a strong solid player he is normally pretty good on the weak side and I think that he's going to have to hold up better than he has been in the first two games because power of evil put on I-4 Road performance yesterday to help them over you as well but you can expect I think the same level of dominance from power of evil over someone like chovy who is truly what are the greatest militaries in the worldwith the facts jungle is a second overall of all players has been quite strong in the jungle of course that's no surprise we watch that flag with unicorns of Love Game very clearly he was the one doing all of the hard work into that game and swim at world twenty20 so at the W want to see him step up now a lot of teams were banned the Caitlin away from death and him and carry a plane aggressive on the bottom side of going to be exciting ignore not at McDon titillating pay that there are solid they're okay but the strength of ignore on this composition is the fact that he will try to Rome out of the lane that part to do with a Caitlin Carver something turtle and ignore have been quietly having quite a good performance bright do they weren't dominant with the MF was critical in yesterday's when a turtle I think you know they were they were actually Tradingcall GameStop in the early stages almost got to be to kill their of course did not and then I ran over by top but I have been solid how they're going to have to have a really good performance here I do like the answer of the Kindred into the graves I think that you know this is one of those jungle matchups were where were paycheck the other one is going to lose but Kendrick can actually out scale an outrage the graves especially post for Mark's you start to really get the advantages you just have longer range from the graves and Graves Kimberly struggle I think to fight in team fight against some of these longer-range Marksman Kaitlyn in addition to a kindred is going to make it tough for him to close a gap when you start getting more items in you take one or two before you close the range and you're all the sudden not able to fight anymore it's great that Caitlin with the Luxe in there for the dueling that is an extremely dominant to be too and as you said ignore likes to go more for the engagement play for the five and five I think that you could get very heavily punished if you try to go to the something like a wreck on again because if you lose the push against Caitlin and Lux they will sayscraps of one side of your Tower field drop a Lucent Singularity that lucky on the other side and it becomes nearly impossible to farm in between all the sudden become so tough self I would like them to prioritize their to be to a little bit but I think spells good things that has been doing so well at world and picnic here allows an out a couple potential difficult for them if they want to try to protect solo but it's going to be some good scaling for them and Elaine we're still do might take a little bit of a beating but he's always going to be useful skill Shakira on the Kindred that is the origin of his actual screen name in Korean a Mark that it would be for Kindred is ketchup to pick up Summer split on purpose but it's cool that he gets his namesake here in this game in the de-facto battle for second place in this group yes they were rematch in we2 where we all know how the LCS fares theresay hey there's no thank you very clever band with that set but aren't there other than that you've got the right you can have some other driver and a galio coming through I can do things like that you can also even go like Shan and N even play something along the lines of a perhaps a Statin did I we've seen that quite a bit actually come out in a from Jovi music very proficient on that champion how we can see things like even chenin Blanc are there are a lot of options here I'll be your sissy where they do go looks like it is going to be a narf playing the Romans 2:4 going for this Pantheon I do worry for there to be too I think this is somewhat difficult you do if you lose the push and I and I think pantana's going to have trouble actually an amazing that I think you probably pushno matter what and what you're going to play, but trap on purpose and put up the shield and the duration to be about as long as you're busy with Stampy and tire combo and play hyper aggressively and I also agree I love maokai I think there is a wealth of Top Lane tanks if people don't play but they're outstanding maokai definitely in the downings absurdly strong should have no problem and I want to see how good and this is one of those things even Poppy I think has a lot of room to come into the meta Champions that are being kind of overlooked people are looking at Warren and Chene and sometimes malphite and kind of just forgetting about the rest of the tanks yes Warren does have an advantageous match up into maokai especially in the early game how you are to have very good trading into the Malachi utilizing the Bellows breath being able to get those girl products on Malachi but that being saidif you get past those very early stages about the damage anymore you know you have a sap magic to be able to feel through that and trade you can Farm it out you point and click DC that is going to help to set up for the engage very very effectively you can utilize the ultimate Apple doesn't engage Builder also honestly as you drop the ultimate as you're moving forward to study done a tower and makes it really tough for a team to then stay on that power to try to defend or chip it down a lot of ways to play that out on the other side power people playing one of his signature Pixies on the Oriana very well known for all of his kind of a typical bills that he was going at 3 on the Comfort scaling made you have form for the top site allows the law to sit back and I think a lot of his game is going to depend on both how people hack hold up a little late but also most importantly the bottom line I really do think is going to be where we see a lot of contentionI definitely agree I want to put all my eyes down on the DRX pot Lane see how well does deplin carrier can do this is maybe the single strongest deal you can pick in League of Legends right now it's very hard Upon A 212 that will beat this heads-up yeah you might win and other places obviously the utility is far higher when you have Pantheon semi Global in cages and Advil across the map yes indeed but the two on Tulane play the lcf is spending to world he is absolutely outstanding and if he can have one of those from game that he had domestically than that of the possibility and so we'll see what comes through this one as we are on the summoner's rift as we open up game 3 of the day dear ex and fly plus are fighting for second place in the group right nowso as always with Kindred you are going to have to track them marks it as I can make a pretty big difference if you get lucky and have the marks pond on the schedule that you kind of have control of or not one thing that you will see some experience Kendra players do is if the marks on the other side of the map to actual just try to delay taking the Scuttle and try to force that to actually spawn on their Scuttle than later on and And Delay that but you have to make sure then you are controlling a Quadrunner the map and that you can't get double pedal by the grave so there is some risk associated with in it also is falling down at the gold and experience that you would expect to be kind of injected in thereall right now no chaotic invades we have seen so many of these games opened up with a lot happening in the first minute half the game this one is going to be one of the most docile there is at most a gboard coming down from solo soaring saying alright I'm going to see if I can figure out work and it's starting all right but has not been touched at 1:31 I think we're good to go to Bentley Trickett at the exact same time that will almost assuredly track any invade Shenanigans weather Santo and does that or pioszak but it's going to be a pretty heavy clear he wants to do red and blue red blue in control. Talk about and then it really comes down to look who's going to get the first hitthis one away sweeper will kill the War II it allows sand turn to be tight this into the brush ignore still sticking around chovy its first move as well and he's got to have to be Mia has to be called finding dodged away from well played on the invade Terrier shows up that shows up trophy shows up for me to is just not fair even leasing the grand Pier for p060a lot of emphasis to putting this Kindred ahead because as I said the Kindred does outscale the grades when you get that range of comes very advantageous you can actually get ahead of the Grave early because incredibly difficult for the grace really have much effect on this game I like the patient's there from DRX you know they had that Rome from the bottom but that was smashed by ignorance really smart and he's straight oververy least get this and the Scuttle on the top side has a mark so we should be able to take the blue deny that Scuttle away and being a pretty reasonable spot here given the fact that there was that many resources to try to put them behind and you talked about how good thing tour in is a lot of credit for his intelligence in his passing is very smart he's adaptable he has good game plans with their malleable he's not just going to hard commit to I must do this path every game he had just based on what is happening in the game this is a good example of that I think pretty smart stuff from him to really not end up very far behind e-chords did steal away to camps to the one stolen of sand for those who in bottom Scuttle goes who directs there's still no extra pants off for Pilchuck long as we are going down. But we'll still see what comes through as they junk cars are fairly close an overall can't count as they're dropping down she'll take him down to the bottom side and he's going to wait until he knows top scuttles been killedtake a note to all wait till it marked bottom side then take Scuttle the tiny Toby pretty soon you can see show be heading down that way as well give me free easily taking the first Marquez long is Joseph was long enough to see if he does want to wait for that just seemed like he is so just getting it low and then actually delaying finishing it does always make a pretty big difference getting that first Mark we could getting a forest Okie every Marcus helpful because you're just getting additional damage on your spells every time but the first four is the biggest one that's where you get that really big range increase every 3 thereafter is nice and they're going in they find us something to find some damage areas are there sharks in the Flashjungle Gangstar how you make this batch of work and first blood comes through know how long the next. That's a picture app that sees a damage has been touring but flight was needed a life went out of the bottle and they found it here very well done that is one way you can punish this type of way because the way they get the advantages is with the push if you don't have your opponent under the tower as Caitlin wachs it's a lot harder to get a lot of damage down that I actually like the TRX had the recognition that alright Carrie is dead now let's minimize loss know he'll use no exhaust use they try to hold on as much as they can on the other side with a flash from Synthroid ignite from a narc cleanse is out from Turtle I'm so they did get the extra resources of course it's still a great play from flyquest but this is pretty smart stuff and pretty patient stuff from dear ex not overcome it was already losing Play It's because Mark stop throwing for a boots Rush here is that I could swing are 3 on 3 kariya is behindthat's so good thoughts out that it going to be in the brush does you know my Spidey senses tingling and for a seventeen-year-old Miss first-year competitive play that's been important one beautiful stuff out of Hanuman black West don't get to punish the in the jungle irizarry-colon pants always do centaurs got that one because Derek needs engage somewhere and so far st. Pete ain't no prompt replies toppling I mean I think that and he is in a good match up and he's going to be comfortable there and honestly going for it you should never get likes solo killed or really have an enormous DS difference in defensive matchups unless there is tremendous jungle interference it should just be a farming out style and I think that's a little will be very happy with that does scale effectively but there is quite a bit of damage and we'll see if they do pick up any sort of healing debuff because a lot of the tankiness from now, you have to remember actually comes from his passive the stop magic where you are getting backHealth you're based on the Spells you use and it spells you've been hit by it recharges that Passavant especially if you get into a spirit visit can get some ridiculous healing from that so we will see and when they pick up any sort of things like an executioner Resort or something help mitigate that going to be claimed so halfway there the first Big Range upgrade Ezekiel on this control work here is well and temporarily 83 Camp leads to Biarritz jungle with both back and forth and out there cuz Greaves Turtle feels pretty safe vs Ortho for Daft is a yeah we are actually win the 2002 like you got a taxi and you can stop us. But Jeff Q-Zar Freight they're going to get really good ways to use all 6 I love this instantly top Christian bands
he's because of course there has an iconic one already this year billion is one of the first Champions at Cloud 9 use to dig themselves out of Penn State play in the North American LCS summer split on cloud nine of deathly made one thing clear ever since I believe this bird game all that play in spinal they have been Tom Kent on blue side and right side every game they don't miss a trick with out here and Holly on blue side as well if 11 Tom catch bands in a row for cloud nine will see if I can can use on throughout the series has I'm really not surprised I want any of the event as well as healing and Nocturne Choice band against Cloud9 preferred Place Allen Jenkins Rd best mid laner is allowed for licorice expect Liquors to hold on to it even though traditionally very flexible between the mid lane almost always gone to licorice for Cloud 9even when they played when it comes to Kane and you think of or afreeca freecs depending on which route they go if they go the poppy having that standard tank for the front line trying to play front to back but as you say they very well could go for some more punishing One V one to try and win the splitcamping up in that top LinkedIn job if you locked in for Spence Karen and Clyde I have to decide if you want some other high-priority camping thaisa and xayah two big ones up there we know what is it worth me taking up table that could be an event for freaking II band face pull up Fords metal for a while, center field something like an iPhone Gauntlet there is always an outside chance to go for a big bow for a very late depending on the only drawback for afreeca freecs is that they're single game freak was messing with the tank that Scion was probably their worst game I the word performance brumskine himself so maybe they will divert from this route second round of band face will come in and the Marksman has not been match this is huge because he's dumped more band into sneakywho has struggled in the group stage as far as the laning phase does go in the first round afreeca freecs of one of those games go along based on how they played so far this tournament Cloud 9 might what does late-game insurance thing okay if it's a very low kill farming early game showing up with a 3 item play stuff you feel pretty good but one of the big things about going to happen to Midland hear you're seeing if we can panaway some of the blind myths that could be safe like rise in front of set up with the kind of pic would be with their daily event for Midland Country bands come through we could also go over the possible counter that Mr Jamie wants to the frog out the unbreakable shield from Braum's as a very good job at denying some of the big play making from Braga to can pop the ultimate in the air to stop that Big D Fightin PhilsI need a hotel right now with the galio and lysandra bands that beset if it looks like for me so just curl blind it first seeing the fans come through and then make actually Jensen a react to your not just played it recently adopted into on this Lane as well already sorry I was so vintage Rock tiger showing up on the world with a lane dominant 80 Gary big for sneaky himself from and loosen plastic and possibly go for thoseearly and that LeBlanc is being harbored here so despite the fact that we have had to be robot landmarks been sanded as diverse as Lucien in the bottom Lane and that is a setting of the Jungle the little flash of the leblancs are made in the top sides could absolutely outrageous a chocolate and harass him come on here on this team we wondered about that as expected the Earth already coming out very important how their bottom weight does do if Kramer Factor than to become much more difficult and going to freak her lie about what you're bringing in Keene and liquor is coming in through remember that the coaching staff of Africa change this year as well quintessential 5th Place team, giant step for the dropping coach off the Korean national they both joined and the results of pocket picked our fix imagine and rage was really mad if this is going to be exciting for Victor as I'm going through this matchup in my head once it's special you get the speed boost off of your cute but you're not going to start out with that early game we will have juggler attention up there would be outside I can actually deal with this wild card cuz you need to be ready for things like this in this festive five well here we are on do summoner's Rift City Last Hope of South Korea versus The Only Hope of North America as a freaking freak of the last remaining South Korean team near the world championship Cloud 9 episode 5 of 6 quarter-final verse for na since 2012 and let's see what can come through here as we get ourselves back on to summoner's Rift for the first batch of the day insane Innovation here especially on the Africa side like you mentioned klepto trades with a Q order going to be the big thing for pain usually when you take cash then you drop weight so you're going to stack that something you're perfect acai I say a group can actually be fantastic Wayfair in and of themselves also in the early game here LeBlanc and definitely her ass Captain Cassian and gained so much power as the magic goes on and closer to that level six see about the early game here because it is double AP Soul winners with an AP jungler as one of the things I was cautioned against here with Kramer needing to find success otherwise he's so Lanes of Cloud 9 can just build early magic resist protect them from both are leaning upon it as well as the Enemy jungler by think afreeca definitely ready for that they've got that as part of the planning starting bottom side here for Spirit on the gragas might actually go topside to protect this Victor early which kind of expected was the only opening that thought I might try and take and to meet us at cautionary tale of we can think of okay to get the speed boats that you tried to come and see sounds perfect very very capable Top Lane champion and Xin Zhao has that Target ability to close the distant no ghost power down but I'm late Ward goes down by Kenny and you salt lickers the start of the game did not lease it instead made the way of pushing group the minions and is going to force his way to push down will be under licorice is Turrentine cannot. That's happening I'm almost very curious as well about the bill that Keen decides to go for with his Victor you can go semi tank with Victor very easily I'm your okay it's just from tariffs or some people even going as far as Frozen heart but we'll have to see how it does develop if he wants to be a full 80 threat or maybe a midline Maids there and told the line you remember cuz I was across the first crush on Victor that was popular for a bit earlier in the year like last year Cloud 9 attacked the kassadin 3 level 6 Clash of Sloan from her if she doesn't tell afford so after this debt he can teleport back out but fence Karen might decide to Camp that if I was him I just returned to the mid lane tier right now has opted to go topside set in the truck was are going to go right there spiritual he walks down some nice counter gang from Spirit from a freaking out about it from his kleptomancy would get too much more 8hp as well as some ad2 Prine Lane with and harass me right now though it's on the warpath. They're going to get slammed Peterbilt play for Spirit ghost junglers fire in the way over and over now since Jared revealed himself on the war that he was trying to go back to Midlands but this is big for bottom one of the big reasons you don't expect Spirit to be playing like this is patient wants to freeze up the minions as much as possible if he still doesn't have a keystone usually we see into backing buying boots and having a predator online that's too successful games one account want to proactively with know by looking at Kean right here then wave is Lily stacking up infants during going to Edge through to block out the Minions that as well. They know that nobody else can make it from bottom Lane in time showing earlier if you cannot play 1 vs. 3 of the damage and the pull back in the top sides now since karyn's on the board 222 on the top side of the map as a free car trying to reset the put out bottom side as well and this should be the first in the game that we get points for Champion kills per minute that means on both sides but if we can fix the folders for Deadpool kills in 5 minutes. This is very much both teams at that thing the expectations that was different on both sides will this last the entire festive I've got a little bit harder to save for the game number one action everyone yours at home that have been watching the 2018 World will be accustomed to a fairly quick Pace increasing over the course of this tournament and this one no different now we are getting to the point where pass it in here is getting to his level six and we'll be able to actually have some agency he is down a severely NCS because of the tell for that he used topside to try and protect key but that will change over the course of this game has been able to pick up his first evolution on that Hextall remember but cheaper where are the ruins Sonic and biscuits here to get there any sort raised in line for the manifold on a whole lot of you and evolve Cube first what is very much about the shield and single Target damage molesto the wave clear exactly what we're thinking with the speed boost speed so important in any age Fox matchup to allow you to try and do not doubt you sweet spot and remember you can actually get the Cuban Spade whether you use it on a champion or onto a minion and you can use it twice in an escape potentially so a lot of ability that a kite but doesn't mean it's going to be any less susceptible Yanks when is father's death with Manito Dimensions manaflow band you can also build into some more men or later but currently Cloud 9 on the bottom half of the map now turning their eyes for Smith's Lube up it'll be a fight fight going to be a collapsible a potential for before it goes back and forth one level this could be better find a stunt with the Alistair will they engage on a Tuesday as of late colors that leaders employed in Florida and it's just going to be there and nobody promised me to pick up as well now he wants to talk but is licorice recital for the first time one V1 I can't paint and look at the damn it to me through the key was on for cool. It's okay blades hitting them again. Winter saving their ultimate though they know that everyone else was revealed on the bottom side of mouth sores appear one-v-one neither of them committing too hard and if there is a flash all in from this ain't talked to one of those tears metal base stats behind the picture a lot of Mind Games around the flash uses between the atrox and the victor once again settle down for a little bit and 1100 Goldie for cloud nine including a steel on the Blue Buffalo can watch this war before the jungle again you said he's down to 50% HBC night makes a call to charge in on the three members that have separated from framer no damage comes out of Zion that reduces the wall Quest level 6 is what it is Africa freaks favorites but
let's burden on execution maybe last Champion Select we saw Africa freaks taunt Cloud Nine with a hover over LeBlanc Jensen happily punish them severely with that pic or see if they do it again already we've got similar bands coming out from Africa or got an is zillion once again all the same Nocturne get added to the banned list for a freak it unless they think a different Champion is more important here and they're debating on the last one if there's going to be something changing cuz keep in mind we are in the same size as last time a 350 shows reading game 159 shoes is blue here and let's see how much the draft is the same for the spruce 7 selections if identical copy to results are in that contain the word some nice moments for it we'll see if they can go that wayafreeca freecs side of the drop Dallas's up once again but a little bit of spirit free Predator after that moment I'm focused on the jungle difference from last game junglers here for afreeca freecs they will still get the power pic of Alistar the definitely and enabling support with your head but full price, you can set up killed and survived he fights with the ultimate and I'm expecting similar pics now for cloud nine to find themselves in early aggressive jungler and fill the brown from before because I can I can see this before pool being pinched pretty quickly and the run back of the same match up there they sell them if they do finally land on those brackets but I think the brown was always expected to hear and will probably keep seeing the Brown Palace or tradewhose head is all around possibility that world 2018 the tape has been getting faster and even though easy travel solution could not quite succeed all the time he wants it right away and seems to be some of those covers and stats the Lacs you could tell Cloud 9 feeling confident after that game that should be a cautionary tale though because best-of-five is a very long road as we said and now they've got a very happy ending here for the road know how do you spell skill so well into the late game if afreeca freecs can hold themselves in the early game they have a very strong Austin for the late and I'm loving the galioinstant given counterfeit Decor they were focusing on beans matchup Frozen 10 to the 1 b 1 and how it played out in the lodge of picture of a Champion Select syndrome and here trying to find this a bit more breathing room macura it is to one of the ones I want to pay a lot of attention to keep for Africa versus licorice and Jensen for class 9 vs care of those matches like they can go very very well that rides could easily go to Keene another high damage pop when he's already played it at world so far keep it at four times the lck summer twist and certainly a champion if you keep bringing out here question is though what can Jensen blind and still have that impacted Earth in game 1 the rise of another strong made into HR strong matchup in the One V one for afreeca freecs there if they decide to swap itI will get the answer to your question shortly free phrase lost in for Spence Karen do hard carry junglers here who can play so offensively Farm extremely quickly as well and look for him to try and context Mafia contract with all over the grave at Worlds in China this time it's been Scaris on Jensen to abuse his match up into Paradise V exact camping you expect when these teams line up here so freaking what do you do to neutralize Jensen's re re does even more important than your skill shot though get a decent amount of burst damage even if you missed the chain re not so much if you missed a charmwent to the match golf course I tried can easily go Medford curling team can keep playing this Victor a truck matchup it did look good individual eat in the previous game for 25 seconds till these teams can choose where they want to chance to Cloud 9 Dem a bare spots Africa will see if it's he totally trademark Victor for up for the new look for keys in the regular season of Summer now it's across an old pic it's one you can always go to but I think he's going to be here until they want to game number two are necessary as a result of game number one Cloud 9 though I do see a possibility of them lacking hard Phoebe and set up for this team competition relies on hitting these still shots for by good positioning from an 8-track trying to chase them without so there definitely is a lot of room for out play in this matchupoutplays always exciting when you get the best team in the world here ASL World Championship the last remaining teams from North America and South Korea here at World's End Mythic semifinal since 2011 when they weren't even invited every year has been Korean domination or at least excellent making the final or winning the title for the last five years right now North America has not made top four 2 2011 Korean since so now to win it best-of-five over Korea for cloud nine to make their first of my finals 2011 that would be historic I do think the title of the Last Hope vs. the only hope definitely a fitting one that has been bestowed upon this matchup and yet I think personally Kobe that history has never meant less than 2018 when so many memes about how League Of Legend players out both on a match by match level and also on a calendar level just haven't happened SKT TSM not at World the Koreanright now in a kind of a whimpering status 1 0 down with a potential elimination of the home region on the world championship team that there's a nation issues but I want to get into this one as it's such a fun matchup I do agree with that point papasmithy and it feels like in the past when people give you the a rose tinted glasses answers of to follow your dreams you can be whatever you want when you grow up it was sounded a bit Hollow and yet this year for League of Legends does ring true it does feel quite a bit different here this year now I think we have the same issue as last week's been staring spilled some of his glorious water onto his keyboard I didn't get a replacement so about two minutes of the ETA I've been given to me this one as we are pause before the game starts and three-point know it's a new one it might be the same I don't know it's hard to tell the same person the same Jersey to adjust to be able to adapt to spend time with the samewater mistake that you showed already out world I've been confirmed that was a new clip I couldn't tell that was the exact same action from back in week 2 of the group stage you hate to say it say it coordination here a little bit on the side of Cloud 9 get them situated before they go into a very important game number 2 as we've learned from yesterday's games in these best-of-five easily you have to put aside the previous results to completely focus on the task at hand and I'm a spy eventually have this rise selected bakura he's already paid 68 games does it cost at went to Rift Rivals afreeca freecs at the run the entire Gauntlet in the 69th game it's his first game on Raisa to 20 seconds unique champion and yet it's one that bassbutter butts so many other players so glad we're seeing these pics come out from both teams in response to what has been shown in Champion Select early we set up this game and he's coaching stats on both side you ready for adaptation of you willing to pull out these pics trusting in their players for the matchups and this time around in response that rise to re-sign up 1-0 over afreeca freecs and it's a very exciting match-up it has been a weekend of upset victories at first game was massive Cloud 9 did not let off the gas pedal that was straight under the right nearly a straight line I do need to emphasize how important the jungle and the jungle pick was in the last game then dial hand initiateCloud 9 Swiss Gear started so many of their place in the tournament is can bring a tremendous amount of damage does play the same front light as in doubt it's much different with a smokescreen really bringing the utility with this champion from there I'm actually zoomed in on the level one because I thought they did a pretty poor job of tracking spend scared of the gang on the Sims out what shows are free, wacky with pretty limited information to some way to curtail what it up in such a high temper game with Spirit reacting to the pro activity has been scaring and I say the word spread of course you must remember that was Mowgli in the lineup fee was able to watch game on with the coaching stop and to pretend she has some insight into Spence Karen's pop the big boy and honestly they should have been prepared for a level 2 bottom from blue side that to me has been the most common jungle start that I have seen all of world's coming off of that Red Bluff passing down through the side I did find success with it early ona little bit of harassment on to Cramer Novi Advantage should go to loosen Brom in a caixa Alistar match up here they're trying to get a Health Advantage supposed to wave at someone importantly Alastair Campbell doesn't have a level-one have to walk up and pulverize you and good players won't let you really land that anymore so it should be the first lead level 2 coming in first post jungle its release list Red Bluff and we have this in jail for Moberly going over to Crux to get a lot of XP in this Farm has been spotted by a war going for the spot side Scuttle provoked provoked a red water right way to see the blue one on the top side of the river that was spotted by C9 and that's why they're playing Buck side with the bra and pushing up the level 1 strength off the duo Lane Gray would have guaranteed money of in roast at least on to that Scuttle crab a very important to not get controlled in a double Scuttle opening from a Graves at the graves get control of the visionthe river I could be very very difficult we mention the quick speed at which you can form and also you know start to take over as far as the range Advantage right now mostly walking over the T9 Vision so they should know that he is in this area of the map and invading hordes the blue box anyway and looks like it's going to have to steal this one away from fence has been scared he went cross map to grab wolves and is only now heading over to answer that blue that's why we see to sin hovering up here he doesn't have any visit the place on it though if I die pushing bottom Lane is what allows you to continue on with this in bed you can see on your screen basil goes up to help fence Karen don't see how much time can I get doneI only took the one Camp just the blue buff then left do look at this he has not been spotted coming in a minute just to be hopping on the bottom if he knows his jugular is on that side but he's very far towards the top side here very close to Mobley who can charge in Pearl looking for a route with this room Fresno Flats but you can certainly try it won't matter I love you call that, because you're right you do see heading towards the size that you have backup on and said Jensen was being greedy or trying to play a mind game but apart from game one way you could really exploit those mine game times for Karoshi are very quickly into the game then since no movement at all instant flash initiation prefer Sentinels he's dead after that and that is going to be a you push that the minions as well to allow for some extra CS in a recall for quiltSummoner spells are just part of a punch board he Miss Polly want a name of the volleyball in the following night is up there and jump away with the Flash and good health card damaged their owners well that was not some high-octane stuff with this kind of tank doesn't come off we've been ignoring topside fit by your king wants to stay in line for the 1150 code but I first Buy on to the Expo upgrade but it's kind of freaking fix sticking the landing they're happy for this to be a slower Pace game only a single killed in the past 5 minutes and that's so big for the men laying here because now if we could priests have to solo Lane that are winning by the loss of game number one matchup predictor into a truck is a successful one p one in isolation bottom side has been pushing for Cloud 9 and has found two sets but now we're seeing jungle attention down there to fry and turn the story around you put me behind them know Cena does have both of their flashes available bus to Summerhill but it would be difficult but I can now in stores
I was never gone their way and it to get ourselves a chance like you see that name spirit is back in for Mowgli and we'll see how much of an impact that make one game to reset his mental after losing game number one he also go to Whatsapp coughing but it feels like consistently Cloud9 I found in the strong skirmishing advantages and they probably need his experience in case it seems I cannot be stopped at last game or so heavily behind in the solo Lane get able to fight their way through a movement on top and a lot of Good Counsel played was already afreeca freecs going with the same man that we are off the table and change with Alex regarding he's knocking his first victim now the atrox can go over the keys but I really like thisNocturne should be an imposing figure it's not going to be here at World the ultimate paranoia taking away vision from the enemy team is strong and fluff out add to the champion of disorganized enemies not being able to coordinate their abilities mean so much to Cloud 9 with a tried-and-true combinations in North American LCS that first use this combination worldMountain World War II sand sang I need a champion that can pull my back line to safety start Diamond Phillips on to the Saints Racine I'm still open ended in her composition already got the most often even if you incorporate early I hate you are able to do it earlier in the tournament if your proactive you find deleted to find my protein you need to either take a priority for Nacht Der Untoten thumbs up or you will be very far behind in the team by here we go though toplessstill coming through the atrox will not be a third game In This Cloud 9 lots of Butterfree could get dipped first and they have not been Lucian so if KY system superframer I think you expect to see Luke and sent a lot of heavy I like the band over so much hard crowd control and no damage with the one victory yeah Kramer definitely on a comfortable pick but it feels like Mickey could go right back to the Lucian different been so successful for Cloud 9very good Atlanta harassment with the arrows but we should also had is very quick and we'll see if we can get the Dodgers off and it's benign of looking at back of my neck is your right solution still going to be three times in a row but it's most likely there for liquor store seems very common here in the lineup. Aureus would be the pic pic 14 in that way we once again be attacking Lane we seen no Dowry is so far but a big big for him in the regular season and a good matchup into on something about liquor it there no hesitation by the way in with the lock in the Pharaohs really comes into play and I'll have a lot of damage having a Galia on your team means that there are other options were engaging you don't need the top winner to be the mainthis is good in parts of summer season but the lck have allowed to eat outdated and impact orientated met up with a lot of play making a specially towards the early game now the Brom which are the moon which brings it all together we should talk about licorice play on tanks are you alluded to it very early in the series freak of the origins of the player and his one-v-one abilities but his tank play has also been one of the biggest strengths of Cloud 9 volt the orange starting off device as well as the poppy denying enemies become one of the most well-rounded players on the whole team would have given over counter pickerel Lane Focus Champion three times and Cloud 9 would still have Come Away with the victory which allkiss you so much more confident looking forward to a tough semi-final in Provo 9 to have coming for themselves but a freak is not native beings placing outdated but he's still have the options to react well if the lights come back on and a galio thumbs down. Can look good games Lincoln answer as well and we are in for Game 3 about that will represent a victory but with Cloud 9 having so many games have the ultimate doesn't feel like that's been the story of 2018 well and we mentioned stronger counter of Nocturne in 2 gal of being able to the ultimate however that's an also pretty good stuff counter to making gangplanks job more difficult in landing Barrel chain you can't see that far into the darkness at the enemy's make this very difficult to put those together I'm not saying very far through the best either at the moment but I'm going to try and keep it together for this gamehope for Korea the last seeds a possibly eliminated before semi-finals even arrives in season 2 of the 2012 with talking about there has been a trying to reach for them and you expect you to have more early-game pressure than spend staring here Nocturne pretty famously a farm to six jungler Bragg as we saw and Spirits game one gets plenty against off early game and well nocturnes definitely wants to get to level 6 as quickly as possible to deathly have to be careful under estimating the ability of the champion in early dueling as well the fear tether as well as the attacks will you can get from blocking a spell I do have some significant threat should be played around and is something to keep in mindsomething I'm hoping for institutions threat this game away from the Alistair is going to be a step up in his last game we count is 3 form its head. Pulverizes it's too late on the plate of nachos or after shock till after the whole trade half did Anne Frank write their attacks does significant damage as well do so start drinking early and Spence can watch over Ward how much of the Jungle Spirit takes away if you have that blue buff trade we had earlier on in the series or if he does lock topside and looks for this 1/2 L Thorn he knows there's no possibility of a kind of cake with a Nocturne on the bottom side where the scary things about your situation especially the early game is so explosive Bodyslam flash is something solo laners complain about so frequently however if a Nocturne is there until a lot ofespecially with them having this year started the trend of taking lethal Tempo huge attack speed on stop on top of your death bring herself Spirit you can see why doesn't want to go to aggressive this early has been scaring elf set up for a free spirit Spirit knows where he is but that's warm and how about the Pearl. Porterfield Shields first 5% Karen don't you not to underestimate the lethal Tempo Auto attack damage coming out of the doctor. Early and Spence Karen Mills Auto Baxterwhen does the volume bike frame and find out they don't have to run faster flash out as well for southerners ready for 390 light at the end of the tunnel here for Africa free as soon as it starts to go bad Spirit dies immediately answer here from Kramer on the bottom side to sand gets his igniter doesn't die and they find the kill on to sneak in the two on to buy finally what does ferrous freshland have some control around that fuel and it's so far has been a black mark for a frickin Fricks in a series of so far as gone very far away from them they need to pressure points that I can't rely on that jungler is a big tail between his legs after giving up first Blood could easily be there in the bottom Lane now temporarily 60s up in a freaking freezing up 700 gold trading with so how he goes against and tries to force me to a battery call I will also mentioned as we take a look this replay will go through this one person see how it all started how to thin on Tuesdays over then he decides to take the fight into the Aftershock already bought the big night down framer no hesitation flashes for fines home with the air strike through and find the first Blood really smart by Kramer when they engage on your tank support hit the enemy Marksman he will die faster and with that choice blew through all of us being at Summers including the cleanse sneaky I got that kill picked out but I will say that for the top side even though Spirit did. I been scaring didn't immediately get to go path up to try and keep this Gangplank on it so he has been farming away with this leftover pushing the orange close to the turret and he is warming up that is definitely going to be a quick level 6 are coming in from these top laners both of those level six in are going to be very big for possibly be creating a place on the map elsewhere and Kane was probably out best games like over in Korea still play this one without a metaphor most usually depends free but because again Sonoran is still available and Spence Caron still Level 5 and only does pinging that level five you're booked on the bottom side pedicures near by five for ghosties Jungle is this better than no Spirit of Seattle self in a three-on-three what is my going to go nice for the season for the lights out nearly planning. Q is Kramer from Top leaders we are looking for immediately lose actually they did a girl the dragon he jumps right back out with the claw do notify both the teleports have been working with that can lead to get a Sheen licorice just teleported back now as well to refill of health and Mana bar so licorice will not join the bottom line to join any fights again but just a couple minutes honestly keep your eyes on that bottom late fee support Arlo Health early on in the game they both blue their flashes and not soon approaching the level six. It's already got his eyes down there though and he's coming through a lane game controller down they know that C9 cannot account for his replacement yet and I must play safe we don't have good ways out cleanse up super sneaky that might be a Saving Grace into a hook look for the soonest available or a Freak the freak out if they want to come it's very hard you could see a movement from Kuro from the mid lane but they're going to attack and Spirits away is most important drops for the side of C9 able to get that Advantage Westfair a bit of a passenger not available and they both go down gold traded fairly evenly make Africa was surprised that Nocturne was level 6-1. Jungler would Mainline Pam was still at level 5 and that seems to be the initial surprise squishy supports like you mentioned earlier your go down and now the reset happens with a map State pretty even all things considered and speaking of map state that kills are on framer Africa their biggest week Flint was arguably the bottom Lane as they could not handle the Lucian Lane this time around both killed and a pharmacist there is could be the one to take the game to the late Kramer was also the one who stepped up in a huge way for Africa free in their change from a week 1 of groups to going 3-0 on the second week of group and also he stepped up for the team in the playoff Gauntlet because he wasn't playing in the regular-season aiming was preferred for the boss Matari.
he got caught on a war then go by Hillsong Young & Reckless then head over to Midland watch the river instead of fat behind the turret and one do you want killed by Reckless we need to see ID for paying that respect over to fanatics fanatics have clearly shown they can not only win but dominate against ID and ideas going to have to play a much more clean game if they want to come out first in this group that's going to talk about these a collie and a rally of Anthony not showing up in this one is still going to put that Camille ban against Nick move some of his familiar options there isn't picking start dropping Tanks off the table and we'll see what the traffic to look like there are so many things to consider here I know that fanatic probably have to Blind pick one of their solos and I'm curious what that might have been looks like if I'd be goes for counterfeit caps with the blind pick and rookie winning the lady face very heavily often farm and again now they are on the right side so we could be seeing another rookie counterpick in midlane and if he has thatmake the attacking that midlane attacking and grouping up with caps to try to get him in that is a blind pig midlantic Ali and catfish trying to do like a great first impression he had probably the most impacted by Kali game I think I've ever seen or whether this is going to be with on the top side trying to play it is something like an old Italian style in that matchup what if you are willing to play the irelia in aurelia's good news match if you can Flex that as well. So we have to see where ID does take us in this next Hill we'll pick another criticism leveled at Jackie love is a fact that he keeps going back to the generosity on social-media thing because the guy that has played much more lame dominant 80 karrie keeping something like as I give me something I can and let the young man go to workis it down at this time around I do like Jack 11 to play Stronger Elena to tell if there's a great team fighter as well on this diet there contouring is there the hills on can always be grab that himself earlier on is it worth taking away the wreck on and making your body to the night from the opponent having that xayah rakan and that's what is going to have to decide and looks like they're going to make the call that it is worth it but then you can look for more preferential Scooby-Doo match up here you already have a fairly Lane dominant Marksman with his diet and you pair that with another advantageous 4th something like Leona compare well it look for kills again through a conflict that could be a way for IG to look for winning way to have not worked out the way a lot of pain so it was going to pump polarity of Leona to not be punished honestly Willows Run so far so I think that would be a nice pic to go to was also the fact that you know now is as real you don't really have to worry about lifemaybe just drop the priority of that pick up a Bass jungle off fan two of those awakes make Brookes or suffer the kind of people that might want to go towards those tests and said they don't want to get pinched on for the possibility of Izzy cream of the crop once you see that work on here for Sia's real face pic no one that was coming and you want to be safe against Leona against irelia expressly should still fairly safe and should not require attention nor the babies think however bottling and now he'll son cannot run out nearly as much as you have to remember that is Fanatics bread and butter that is always what they want to buy them the ability to make plays on the map in this is certainly not the lane to really do it the way that can be a soft in the Middle Lane is c a r l e ever goes in just hit the root get your Aftershock walk away in case I call it does get flexed over keep in mind IHG get last day on the mash-up they're willing to pick the early Indy calling they're going to watch his Whipple pics of Top Lane Champion as well or move the akali and we speakgoing to get those stolen car fixed without the ability to put a rally in one of the strongest Champions into the midline that can be protected in this drop and it does allow juice if he wants you to play a Carrie up in the Top Line while still having bright engaged something that means played against T-Rex I believe and played it to a tremendous level and I think if they could get through the early game with a pic like that can be very strong but then you do have to worry about the fact that Proctor has a very strong early game performances a couple of lead-ins that he turned it have look really really good and we know that Zack can be punished early sometimes and if you fall behind you that Lisa and maybe never really get the chance to get the given scale steam play Olaf Leafs in trundle even are still plenty popular 24-hour place when will pick the available that Zack is left up as well and Invicta if no dragons probably and if you canHorse Sense there is a good damage a good early game Frontline jungle it's not only that actually really messed up that late in combo when leasing goes in a few just buddy plant back toward that make the cake a little bit harder than any specific it's also kind of that to do tank so once again you can do exactly what we said with his axe throwing the gauntlet buy firewood South style and I don't think nothing has really sell his prostate in that Way the final picture of an attic what is Whipple going to play with you keep the akali or they locking it off later and put that went into words made they lock in a tank for him to whip o will go back on it before and we have to call in the middle Aiden & LeBlanc vs. akali in the midline is another advantageous match up for rookie this is one of them. A lot of people have been looking at as an answer to call in the middlewith those distortions and looking to dominate that lame as rookie has been known to do is also one of the Mind Games with Heidi has done multiple time now carry they stop jerking they picked himself something that is flexible and then all of a sudden stop playing as well I didn't want to give away one of the safest top-class midline is in the game right now I think the flexibility of this has really helped ID in the pot and well it is a Cari Champion it's certainly not the few are where you have to come in this is much more of a team fighting carried this is a composition that certainly can look at a scrap with the Natick if they try to draw them into that by B5 so it's going to be a very exciting game on the line if your seed wants me out of the group you're playing Edward gaming Cloud 9 or G2 Esports in the quarterfinalshere we watch the EU LCS but if you received two if you do lose this game your battle for KT rolster the Korean Champions World never give up their own right the only other Korean time remaining in this tournament definitely things to play for in this time Breakers are in the quarter-finals but who do opponents will be are going to be decided now or the next half hour of League of Legends fnatic Invictus gaming on the rift the battle for the top spot in their group and we'll see where the fanatic can continue that momentum that was such an impressive Victory it would still be fresh on ig's mind and things me to change the Invictus lineup Nautica setting up for a bit of a cheeky Little Wonder records has been spotted to find out how is Q I like that if you was up able to get away no problem though and it will be a fairly uneventful early game free golden Reckless when's the Q that doesn't result in anything but I like the attempt right you do going for these pre-planned level one there's very little drawback to the most the time and sometimes it is going to get you a kill sometimes it is going to get you a Summoner at the very least it will show your opponent's a hey we can mix it up in the early game and you have to play knowing that we could be waiting in any Bush and I think this is two games in a row actually wife and I decided on the only game we mention the fact that it's laced then pulled his wife got pushed in allowed himself to scale-up never really want Alain versus the shop it certainly was more relevant as a game for Creston was more of a team fighting for it this time around we'll see whether he is able to do the same thing he's going for a little bit of a cheeky Peak into the top side of the map now with North when they hear starting I like that where the IG puts down it shows they're trying to push really game this really cute as well it should track most of rocks and fossil gang fast and I think you should be able to show up without any difficulty tell if I'm going to be. In place little bit of damage but this phrase not going to mean to do much either way though it is IG getting the stuff down here going to post and it will lock Hillsong up this is already brought to moving down if he comes around this way down you will not be spotted by the ward so we could be going in well he's only going to be level 2 on this one is going to walk for going to space Truckin to land the Cuban Jack you look a little bit early waterproof and they failed of last name from Jack Elam too late he brings lease it straight to him and brought some another game another first bought on the boss and you can look at it to write a The Flash the initial cheer and just admit that you messed up if it gets kind of have to hold you have to flash much later in between the landing of the Cuban the first one that comes out because otherwise applied you're just a Sitting Duck but once again you got to go for an early gameplay Sala fan. A 32 days in a row and able to execute on something like this happened this is avoiding where that Vision was places smart passing from Roxette it should have perhaps just been a Summoner but even then it would have been worthwhile and instead it is a first slipper broxah two games in a row incredible start for fanatic Forest that is beautiful right there from fanatic they saw the Lord come down to new the root rot so I had to take an executed very very nicely there so foreign to goes lead for fanatic making this so late in the group stage they had lost my ID back in the first round robin but might find those who wins in a row now in the back half is once again engaged before it's too damn much and I'm sitting here thinking you know people saying caps vs Realty this is Elaine match up to watch before rookie where is early to take the midline and get a lot of tools to eat bottom side of the map to be able to win out and I think that you know if game 1 of Easley it wasn't successful became number two was and now that puts a lot of pressure on rookie because he is so you might need to smash it when I'm in the car to pick and with your bottom line going poorly if they lose control. We have the potential for retail if you know all those alarms going going into the midline from bottom light this time even more successful at doing that yeah definitely agree and I think it is encouraging for the side of Fanatics I think I hate it doesn't always have to be about cats right you can have carry threats bro the other lane you can have a stepping up like you did in the first game you can have broxah having these incredible games to carry you through even against the top level of Moana and so certainly encouraging things for them moving forward toward those quarterfinals this guy is having a very good tournament as being definitely the best jungler in this group I was saying she has released a lot of pressure with some tomatoes definitely get stuff from him and of course is one of the newcomers to fanatic he has been huge for this squad and let's see what can be next for these players we know they're going to the quarterfinals that question is that what's the in with her but it will be before that drops will be there right after the game's conclude so we'll know these answers very very soon do separate ants coming in as tax is trying to subdue is Midland Magic once again has had to Blind Pig gets rookies never had the chance for a fair fight every single game he's faced offered to get Tyler picked every single timer to get this BS lead the cast is very good at losing the minimum not usually giving away kills it against you come through often does convert have historically baton LeBlanc I'm paying back to when I had Arena was first Chinese around by they will get it was either early man has more magic things like hex Franco and potentially get better depending on taxes out of my vacation if he's will it really willing to invest in the one we want I'm going to try but double knockout Dracula doesn't have a way out and they will continue on the Badlands one more shot and killed a bit late but it still kills on the bottom side for fanatic broxup has been everywhere the start of this game making so much happen for fanatic at this time it's Restless who gets one of the skills which is huge for them without any teleport response coming down so this is going to be as real coming online soon as I need to find it when they came went pretty aggressive rat is a very nice boy book and I'm going to try now the topside level 6 going to interrupt the old even a flashlight but it's over the trade-in trying to make things happen around the map knows his team is falling behind so we make the play happen in the mid lane but had no flash off at end was a little bit low Roxas turn to make something happen here once again and they might have this one rookie rookie place with every opportunity he can go to turn around and go for it don't worry about it happening on this but you could say the rookie wanted that too if you want one more time so good Rome to make sure Pat Tanaka the worst for Gila saying what it is and outplay for rookie and Nick once again on the top side no flash from with low as well as sick as my from the cast and walked away in his life what is halfway there from with both going to go 1 V2 killed
Eastside of balance I think that the big swing point, I think is one way that I D could go right now because fanatic love to play craps of across-the-board they don't always play with respect to the jungler because they have such confidence in their individual play in their mechanics to carry them through and that can make you vulnerable to games and I actually already love how the fans are kicking up so far because it's what's the weather for Tuesday for both of these teams. Get the shy and Rook you're such a threat has Assassin's the arelious and the akali Tom pinch remove the safety from the bottom Lane to let Jackie Levin Balin punished is it so hard for me to even add pork chops on a scentwould love to play a skill match up here he would love to play something that is less punishable I will see if he is going to be able to find that for himself crispy calistar is so exciting for an LVL lineup is actually pretty clever though because what they're trying to do is take away that good match of the toppling for the shy they're saying great you wanted to play either side of the urga aatrox match are you willing to play a much more risky maktub you know if you don't even know which ones going we're so if you were to say you're a pretty clever it doesn't get very heavily physical damage though because it doesn't really play ap boss that's what I was going to say there's no real playing a little bit more of a tank with why I like this seeing how well I GPS engagement ring a paint fight I can be a risk but do you think Tilia right away and then I'm going to be nosey look for them from here in the bottom Lane to add to our safety down there I agree with your point about being physical in the cop somewhere and popular anymore if you can still do like to have some damage but burning play Denzel or something along those lines they shy play the Gangplank Top Lane and then it doesn't matter they just run it each other over and over again Blanc one of the champion set the Top Lane what she has always really preferred historically has the IG does want to Target his champion pool again often does not like as much but it is going to be banned away anyway all right choice I'm going to go walk in right away no hesitation there for Fanatics site and they're going to wait for the jungle pick last I don't expect the atrox Whittier got to go there I think the success in that rolls of it limited but what would be the flex who is Tristana this is certainly I think a fairly weak Laney face but I still think that Reckless and his style of play his work very well with it you love to build attack speed he loves the force that is because Donna style it'll come down to if I G can hold the way even if we are going to get oh my God this is really incredible to watch what I said earlier really does come into play because great this is a counter pick Isaac is a lot farther of a matchup for Peoria this is going to be so ridiculously high for this game IG in the group in fanatic to prove their worth against his IG team trying to force a tiebreaker and claim of first place C and forward motion aggressive compeer fanatic there are no Farmington Invictus model damage type not a huge problem here for Fanatics will see with a massive go over all with this is going to be an exciting one for first place in the group fix a no and it's theirs by right The Fanatic when we get a tiebreaker right after this one and essentially a game 3 will decide who is taking the top spot first these definitely much more important for the koala better in that second seed at the quarterfinals certainly a bit easier for the winter here aggression all-around how these teams could stack up against each other cuz when you have rides for you or you can play one so he want and do the exact same thing if this becomes a meatloaf I do worry about the ability to get in Sallisaw a champion. You always talk about first engagement at the same time extremely credible write this could be a difficult game fanatic to really be able to pick them off in that one teapot it is very true but the same time Fiora is not that good of a team better it is very 52 Dubai on this Champion if you use the report that the wrong time you will get shredded you are not building those things. So I do think we're going to be I'd be pretty heavily pushing that can be dangerous for fanatic as well because in that late game can get a match up against the atrox play the pee or NCR God because cats have taken the atrox I think this is a very smart moving so when we talked about a draft while we are on to summoner's Rift you heard those teleports coming in a battle for first in the group on the line Chinese fans clearly in attendance who you're rooting for IG Europe is showing up as well all right have a game this is certainly going to be exciting we saw that your bow at the very end of Champions elect their of course if you're mentioning as a lure. Risky or the intended matchup for fanatic and I think the big thing here to me is that one team if they sideline is full of behind has a very good disengage you have a look at things out Tristana as well as Brawn they going to accelerate going backwards so you know if it works and caps get ahead in the sidelines I can push in that court is hurting Asian on the flip side however if I G sideliners get ahead it's going to be half of Russia and he'll the song to generate engages so I think that it's early game and is so important to play the words with hoes Lane I think that they need to be able to generate a gold leaf Fiora from behind is one of the worst champion in the game that's why I'm ahead she's insufferable go to sings the true and only imagine to walk for a volatile top when is going to be exciting she is going to play that leads directly Boaz they hardly comes in for Brockton really think you do have to expect do that for this year again Ciara got it is going to be very tough early on or got very likely going to have the push for a lot of it is going to be able to harass me or under the church as she's trying to farm up and no certainly I think it takes a while for if you are to be able to come online unless there is Google internet big brother to get stoned about Lindo decent trade in there for breakfast a barrier or I should say Guardian block them at all the damage than I still have the first push in this Lane so skill matches thought maybe we could start with a rockstar and stuff in the bottom side quickly actually that was rather listen to Scuttle to make sure that least admit he couldn't bring that one around as he leave in a drink at work watching the other way through the lane really like that just to be able to protect Reckless on the bottom side he wants to push on the drisana it's going to be about shoving in so get that schedule a little bit more vision is safety for that fanatic bottom Lane but I do believe but sent out camping this brush he comes down but he's not biting edge of the Bride Nevada how close to the wall hug you out but also isn't easy to take out from the pixel brush so I like the reward position they're also allows for the map to just be sleep now play sleeping award in that location at level one and ige revisits what's the word back down that it was trying to get there for to buy very smart or to buy idea but very very very smart and unsung in that one and while there is a push for now for the fewer it's very much because we thought before leaching thought he was over at the red so sure I was able act the crap that Wade getting going in his Direction you do you have your first fast and it out as you go into a game and he would have to look for my opportunity yet have two heads just throws a bilities at the Fjord. Doesn't really throw it it take for your eye if a standing within the crate website not waiting to see ASRock to getting a little kind of done with himself is going to try to walk into that side of the Jungle didn't find much now fighting for these chickens like he was going to land and very little as a keystone away drops and Lucy lost time down there but he will have a couple can still kind of retreat you on the top side and there's no cast up right now for ning so he can either try to look for some gangster ass or just simply reset on the map and it looks like he is trying to get in position to come over the wall with rookie guard range but not going to happen there now he shows and their benefits coordination and this is something that I should be through Santa turn off the top of the Crank It Up by Ciara doesn't have to back on the phrase did you can say right now there's a big as hell just off hard if you had to go back you could be another way so I like this actually a nice guy but you have to believe rookie and she's not in this fight it was taken some damage there I got my name is wrong for no good reason before we called there so we can try to set up that freeze trying to deny some of the farm from Rookie and may Force rookie the TP back what she does to make sure that way you can crash rubber caps is sitting on it night and is down on the farm so credit to rookie for a strong early laning phase and last time these two men leaders did BD certainly got the best of caps as well night pretty big farm Lee + 18 this early a truck fixed so far not doing well slow magic Mantel in Boots the first item cast trying to sort of suffer through this one that's almost just got to make a bad matchup for the shy but that was not paying for it yet he's equal in farm and tapped his suffering through it to that point with it has also gone for the Bramble that for his first item so it's not like he's looking to dominate will keep him very safe he's probably never going to die so I can't trade ever cuz I'll take more damage than a deal so I didn't make a lot of sense for the match up to ensure you can never lose the link yea and I would say you can also sometimes for straight more aggressively with this item because there is less appealing and with that ultimate perhaps no be able to actually make something happen in the wealthy want but we'll see how it was able to do up there that now they should I just make me play against the way without any additional ID can you push hard enough to get engaged I try to walk down to get to find a slope has arranged for it to head down that had the ultimate available that could not getting rain right play from Fanatics a funny show progression yeah I really nicely done there for a boxer to be able to get down there Reckless and Hilla saying able to set it up and we'll see now it's the shiz able to get any sort of Advantage up on the top side but you're very aggressively in this Lane for trading and I think this is just a place towards that cuz he just wasn't immediately after the fact that he's jungler right now in NeNe's on Crump camp that is just a very bad play from Belen to look for her ass at that stage then that much River Vision either other than that navigate to mention a spotted owl that went poorly so fanatic tide and gold as this game moves forward the Midland Farm different still masses answer though by the fact that first one of the Jungle is night and hang out and I delete anzio Tristan or accelerated a lot of the problems we've been discussing for fanatic U Toys R Us in the midline as well as maybe a slightly more defensive perspective on the matchup he's a very good thing out of one of the best champions in charge of going up against you do a meal a call on the side of my Jeep could open up very quickly yeah I really could I mean if you get Reckless ahead you can group and perhaps Bush worth if you were to come to you before she is really ready for that stage of the game and we'll see if an addict is going to be able to do it because hers Lee IG does have the form of Damages in a number of these lanes and that is why that kill for a rock that was so important to really get this team back to even Keel there is a great Catalyst he is very aggressive with Lady continually looks for his own place and looks the same place so I think that you know you think he's a man but call from Cops arguably do you want to have a gold late and he's going to be processed at any Ulta impacted one of the most volatile Lane in that bottom line at this stage you know, so once again very short-range will want to look for those crappy 5 can be taken advantage of elegant still at the game if that's going to start taking some of the Jungle away this is one of the good things about Midlands with cc to get take scuttled give your topside some vape pen and Pad your stats find 114 gold
thank you very much and we are into Champion Select and hopefully sooner doesn't get banned if we can talk about this sick mechanics at Riu has and Jack does not do things guys are watching the segment though will they have learned it I think it is very unlikely they would learn anything from jet segment there these very rare is gold feel like extremely good syndrome players that are now to do what she was talking about bands or G rex versus hundred thieves okay well anyway last game of the tournament for these two t Exodus fighting for the pride of their regions fighting for certainly the pride of their own teams both want to show that they are a team that certainly you can pick out please other top teams looking for their birthday when is looking to stay dominant over the elements whatnow you know the time test results Galax. Could mean that today I guess that's why she picked in the bottom light bathroom in one thing that I think has been missing from this hundred save Squad is the ability to get afro volume to one of these unique and they tell me why I bought or blitzcrank even a fraction I think this part of that is to do with her Sara hasn't been the most stable midlantic all them however I do have high hopes for this game it'll be interesting to see if we got see the BART earlier today certainly didn't work out against fanatic but he did play is thrush last time against you have a very good game on it I do also believe that after I moved you is a very strong play making support he can take over a game on his best day and he's going to be looking to do that here for me when I forgot another word for something when you play forgot earlier on so I can see better look for him I was sad to see him on Scion both their games today in the group stage butthis is the look of a composition that I say put two of their three best players on big Champions and characters with the agency over the stitches play one of the standout play as for why we hired another group stages getting in the middle of the game 80 carry that does have its own playmaking ability as well in the callistus Italy says his direct line up up with except that we have a lot of potential there as well with a Twist that you can get on top of your Spears up I'm certainly are some powerful killings you could run this could be a support brackets for koala is a flex available there though obviously to Jungle for emptyyou should see where how do thieves goes with the 80 karrie cuz there's already been a couple Marksman band that they did decide to go for the chili at 4 and up before the second round of being so few more of these Marksman and try to get themselves a preferential matchup for Stitch see if he can be the difference-maker in this game and One Direction looking really good and play into a particular phenomenal player hopefully he put another good show for us today and they're going to move back to the picked up but we'll see what he wants to go for I assume they'll wait to counterfeit mid length of a car is fixed can be locked in here historically Alyssa has always struggled with her at the Landing site take out the trash can just walk it actually take this is a fairly positive line for a hundred days and nightsand you know for a tiara bands out of him to second tier of marksman fixes all really good you got the photos caixa and xayah who were almost every single game that where you looking at losing art restorer the serous think they're all very good before I do think is a strong leader to be these bands talk more about mobility and immobility reposition in a fight you look at the bat is the reasoning gear and that is initially what I had assumed when you see those Ben varis is going to have a hard time getting away with that being said you do also have fresh with afros in a good position can land you out of danger in somebody's buy gallium Nocturne gragas everyone flying in on top of you and it could be Calista office that is flying in on top of that fair at them they're certainly going to be going aftercaulifla Mobility carried like the Thalia like Tavares who I think could be very vulnerable in this game I agree to a certain extent but I think that that is a great game plan if you generate a lady to push forward right now you don't have to push in the midline you don't have to put in the bottom line in my opinion either if they go into a 1-3-1 set up show you can pause but you can only have so many mistakes before 130 just ripped it open to look at going to come down to whether T-Rex trying to take those windows and so far in the group stage they only have like two degree definitely would agree but at least it does get for them a very clear way to play the game of very clear wind conditions at something about a talking about the ability to pick these dive contest to give yourself a clear way to win every one targeting this one or two players everyone going for with the same goal it is much easier to execute very often than it is to play a front to back or to play 1-3-1 or somebody more complicated Place dolls and here we go into this one is we loadfor the last game of World for these two teams if other things when they picture themselves third place in the group losing to the LPL number 2 in the EU LCS number 1 and Thing 2 in for a fitting couple victories over here acts themselves made it through pretty they were mostly dumbest throughout their game hoping they can at least get a single Depot in which team could not just yesterday here in the group State and so doing one of these time for third place in the group to definitely some pride on the line and we can see what he's going to do for us in their last game of the yearthe players are as well and we'll get ourselves into our fifth game of the day laugh out of her first reports coming in after this one tear up the blue hundred thieves in their home colors of red Sunday on a bit more of an influencer in the stop playing in Milwaukee is Rios going to try to prove himself on Rise and I do want to mention the fact that they wrecked coming in on planes he's going to be able to make it out of that group and kind of what this means for the album estrogen is a holiday really would like to win this game and tie it up at 1 and 5 just because you know when you say mad coming in people did have some expectations on the room and keep my soul has flash if needed a body slam from quality really need that I can take some out of this world crowd control left leg injuries and depending on how hard and a goes they can maybe force delayed recalls but theoretically they can get back to Lane and not miss too much here that's the reason why the fountain still really nice level one and they may actually startthe red will see if they're going to stick around at all they have a lot of words dropped on the side of the map but could be another delayed invade it's really good bit of work to do if they want or spotted yeah that would be a pretty sure they didn't notice that was actually dropped because that word was dropped in their Vision so I think they should back off and go to their own blue but we will see could be it could be a level 1 rhombus is pretty crazy start they know that no one's even exist yet now they can see it and as we're both getting weed stuff koala have a feeling I wouldn't body from the right if I were him a lot of words all around make sure that they might be coming down he will not be the body slam he'll stay alive that's probably to be before 3 call Lynn to be hard with that little healthy yam and he's going to have to go back to he's going to try to lasso back in this is already a bloody game and I have to run a car on top of damage charts overall come out on top I would say with the steel way of the red and it's going to be a bit of a tougher start there but empty is already counter Dudley he's already taking away and is red so not even sure if that ends up being true an app remove going to have to use both his potions at does get very hello but they do. Down on the flash left can Sunday come down his own. Y pique and if he's still on the run in front of him with me to go to having a fairly good side to this damn nice invade I think over-aggressive from afro nearly cost them but then pause while back to the top side of his jungle football stopping at blubaugh and able to shut that in Baytown very far ahead yet level 3 he stole away the bus and he's coming over here behind Danny and he knew that and I was right there he knew that he had just killed his jugular that he would be on that side of the map candy plane without the respect he doesn't have a cleanse he has no way to get away from this but here is empty no word in the brush he's not sitting in clear that camp from the brush so you see if end is coming over and should have been able to position perhaps a little bit better to keep himself safe model is in fog of war and then you can't get the jump on them you're throwing pebbles into the Raptors itself helping and clear out the gas station she's actually has up by from and I love the fact that it keeps licking back towards the middle part of the maid maximum distance between candy and the tar that she's very well play also positioned himself to block that Jeff is so not enough difference was really ever going to be able to be created there a really good start 400 series but you have to feel a little bit has been kind of donated over to them here by G Rex in these early minutes I'll look it up in a pan here it's only $300 difference bookkeeping my other line's been going pretty well you got good farm from emptying of Italy for cyst on the bottom side so rude to be had a nice way for butt Stitch does have plans if needed and a seismic Tuffy's and has already for you know very nicely done from a hundred thieves jungle dream game here four and three killed in 4 minutes is a very impressive star for him and he's looking for Maurice get behind candy here he does have flash he's going to stay out of range of this real rise so that won't be a killer summary of the first failed Bank of the entire game for Android and I like how active hundred days of pain on the map you know we said we would like to pay it again soon pictures they went to some place I didn't really work out this time around pretty much every play the F-14 has work to Allen White look this up the story called yet will actually let him go back enough it is one of those games now where if you are dear X you need the game to slow down a lot to come on lunch yeah you definitely do and 1/2 remove nice with a flash play the classes available but not much chance of getting out of that one without his flash up he did have a clan but not able to create the distance then you see end up Lincoln right in to get that pull back when you get it when you get hooked self still could have even though the hook and it afterwards and now we go again too far away will that make us play a Frozen fog take a lot of damage I got to try because not going to land good. Buy fish and if I'm not going to let either koala stays Alive stuff from Stitch I need the sidestep you will stay alive and now it's going to be a 3-man play or potentially to me and play your album the topside directions to keep somebody from getting back to his turret so up to the not as well fit PK so if he's able to land the Miguel the flats key over there's no way out for some in a sisterly going to stop playing going down and a lot of farm lost with already tipila stop when I need to play around PK on it was very good something I would have liked it to go back to us more stop playing carries and that's a good Kill Ya certainly and I mean it's just the self is less impressive to me than the setup that he'd already put some day or twice before seeing the TV back she'll come out again free 6 then he has to make the long walk back and there is there waiting for himself or the execution may have been easy but certainly some impressive Landing from PK to make it happen and I think the more impressive thing is they confirm the kill instantly that the flash people flipped back guarantee ultimate we've seen so many ultimate come across a kind of hoping it hits they know that they have to play set up why not go for the hundred percent way to complete it nice more and more Farm 21cf lead up in that top 20 game might just be the force that directs needs to get a win of the board here in the main stage world are they will sadly and forth or time for we'll see which way the ends up there and I'm going to keep clearing the jungle for now though and equal in far but me Hunter gold brother kills he's gotten the most be funded Through the Jungle happy and you know it makes me laugh game the ignition off and a half way through that second flip the media is the next at the end of the year is tithing required to this laptop suddenly changed the way the hundredths place had to approach the game on the flip side you remember that they were playing a digital midliner additional support player sometimes two additional jungle is at the same time for T-Rexes a team that was trying to find that magic recipe computer other mid-layer play but let a couple times candy came in once in awhile now Stitch going to be looking to do set the game he's got to be wishing he was level six so badly right now if he had the ultimate perhaps going to turn something around there but instead it is that's two kills four hundred thieves and everyone get the way but app remove 100 days of just lifting much more coordinated
personally hottest man single-handedly almost maybe they're watching a lot more LPL I just love watching him play carries he did show up once earlier than turn it but it was on a Scion so I'm praying for carries in toppling for try the interesting thing is ELP I'll ever since you know people LifeWay shout Uzi in the lake I just ain't sent it around team fighting bottom line tearing people apart so you don't really get Carrie soft playlist with someone that tried to do what you know LeBlanc Top Lane qualifying into the LPL now and state gaming close by that also has U-verse able to pick up kind of Assassins may just be carry top laners and have great impact in the game so I want to see whether that is something that they try and add right now in the plane stage to make people aware in a best-of-five I mean I also like the timing of it when you are on the right side this is a team and a region where everyone's talking about throughout the year blue side being so overpowered really having pick advantage in the LPL red side actually had a higher win rate at the same timethis was in my opinion largely because guys like to die and a lot of detail guilty and were able to use counter picking so effectively red side and slamily of course they already played this game and this is a very exciting game overall do what they will indeed choose to play of course 3 carries already gone with the akali aurelion Camille bands from earlier on theater at Ace rock smash up down there as well I'd be sad if it was on Versailles on but of course that could just happened I would be sad and you know we have to keep mine hunter these are already out of the tournament but they can still do other Western Brothers fanatic a favor here you know if you do actually in a beat Invictus Invictus lose again I believe that would actually matter they're so obviously you know it would require two losses for Invictus though most like later on we know they're both coming outbut yes it's Matic one game behind you saying as hell they can take that first seed in hundred thieves can only help fanatic but even if you want to play it on the line help Cloud9 give them an easier for us credit for it if I like upsetting a dick is even easier to move on from this point as we has been grabbed in sokai set alarm for the bottling vs. IR work on if I could see that you know you going to get Foster probably a hundred days he has been able to secure a table pay citations Homestead makes sense which has it has been up and down I think there's a main issue a lot of people would have with it a hundred days right now is their execution throughout the earliest stage of the game they pulled out in 1 V1 to V2 situation means Anna has to get incredibly busy around the mouth when you don't necessarily doesn't want to be in that kind of situation to pay top make the proactive Choice a lot of the time unreactive back foot and I think that that is wet a hundred things need to stop putting the Methodist I definitely agree and it's tough as a jungler enter midliner is losing these mashup heavily to really have much priority in the jungle because guys likeguys like half door then going to join up with their junglers they're going to invade they're going to be in your face and no last time around 300 these did struggle pretty heavily against Invictus gaming we'll see if they can turn in more impressive performance here are they are also obviously playing for pride they want to be able to show that they can compete with some of these talk to you after they want to get back to the drop quickly this is something that I actually do more people to expect he became a little bit of a man because he was just willing to Blind Pig thing and the drop he does have a great town to pick flexibility however with the guy coming in they do like to drop the priority of his big down to the bottom because I guarantee that line where you was not known for his cookie playing found in this situation and I do think this is now a drop where you can play the world stops I thought of mine going to stay out just fine so funny when they grabbed up here and yes it's can be flexible between top and Middle East in both lysandra & Spine in both these roles but I'm still expecting that to be just another love song I Met game for Wii U and a blind sign up for Sunday yeah I mean we haven't really seen you flying a lot of tanks made so I'm really intoare going to get that carry top and it'll it'll probably our GP is one of the most popular picks in the LPL certainly is an outstanding performer from the red tide end of the tanks often get that somewhat free Lane scale up and then have a big impact later on though it's unlikely if it is also a very good Gangplank this year as well I'm not expecting it just saying it is an option here at the time ticks down this is very very like Wood Lane assignments are Leona is known as what supposed to be a good pic into xayah rakan but of course I ever conflagrated do in themselves bottling to get to swing into ride to some Gangsta not going to drag us both make it happen but the one I'm excited for is this try getting a free Farm Lane and potentially taking off and this is a thing as you know we might actually allowed games like in a lot of the games that I was able to say to get a kind of on her Astro at that lady's face Denny's ultimate in fight it's just such a useful tools having an a 08 Toyota Corolla people into specificis at the map especially when you fighting round face black repair old bike early Dragon just become such a part until obviously like him Stanley potential is a gang playing also off the charts knocking for Ser if you're fat or galio or your TV that does nothing when the lights go out when paranoid but you can still have a team-mate paying or you just like pressed for and see where they are and just dropped a button down on them so either way a game that will be fun to watch the victims of the only undefeated team left at world only three themes in the end up 4014 have gone undefeated in the group stage two of them went on to win the championship Samsung white and if they feel like I'm see one with maurin for those do squats and the only other loss to the one who went on to be the champion South High Kings on certainly if you go 6 to know things are looking good for you I G has had impressive group stayed so farand it really has seen bikes probably is only fanatic who can challenge them but we'll see if under these can Buck the trend in and upset this group a little bit quickly the start of this game because there's two things I do IG was underrated coming into the store to minute that contest vs R&G we're closer than people had given them you know credit fall on paper or a cat named and I'm not saying it. Or I'm just sitting here and as highly rated isn't as good as people right at them and now I am positive believer in phonetics I think Will Proctor in Castle shown in the TV to Midland will give a lot of times trouble in best-of-five series they have a lot of weapons to be able to throw at you so that means it Invictus gaming potentially is a top-four team in the world right now and what does need to you know really be given that respect they definitely do I need to do this day really has been very much it seems like about fanatic an IG going stroke 4 stroke going545 kind of thing showing who can be more dominant because it has very much turned into it to teen group and that's going to be a force that six game Showdown it if I can find a fuse pull the upset win here it means that there was no tiebreaker needed fanatic and just win take care of business and then be the number one spot and suddenly have a much easier chance as we know all the other teams that could be in the quarterfinals in you and you see if I can come out all the number one teams were the expected number one teams seconds to get out of this group is much harder than it would be if you're freaking out of the group absolutely and I think that they think the Mets is it we have some wild cards coming out now ATT no one really knows how long we going to say the fat to me GT for the Westin ATT losing landing page Cloud 9 how did not attend a performance in that group stages I think the fanatic has to be more consistent than both of those teams in IG now need to show the same consistency as a golf against a hundred faced a very consistent C they only dropped one match the entirety of the LPL summer split yes they did lose eventually in game 5 to Royal never give up in the very finalsbut I still speak to me like a consistent team that can do a lot of good showing I had IG the top 14 coming in the world that has not changed her me and I want to see if they can keep taking care of business and make that 600 run kinetic to be honest because I bought a zoo interchange top light is but if that's how planets play different roles on the table yet they find success with both of them they both have support players that domestically people they should be questioned they make questionable decision at certain time I mean it looks like I'm bow out of the moment you know certainly two of those play that you have to take a look at those so many cops in about 2 hours to check the game of the day and maybe the 7th if we have a tiebreaker but for now it is under these hoping to do whatever what team liquid did on their exit of Worlds which is they might be out they might be down but getting us feel good wins for the regional pride and of itself is very valuable here and I like that. So they stand this. Everyone in line and they going to look to get the early push they going to start Andrew phuckable on the fivewhat's my balance done rhetoric aside from attacking anymore and not trade goes level one is one of those Matthew is something that kind of tends to lend itself towards a more up-tempo game which I think is the style of a play you're going to need to bring out against IG I don't believe that hundred thieves can play a slow Mac without game against this team and come out on top so desire work on bringing out the Nocturne blue Sondra so much. So much engage for them to be able to Target someone like that you love if you could get that perfect and take him down you will have a chance to win the game but I mean Jackie love taking the cleanse is also a very intelligent moving and not two words that same as play that way naturally and this isn't your natural tendency which it is a 400-page you know they are more of a scale up into the lake GMC send you are at risk of trying to do something against the team that just does it better than youYouTube games does Norco welding landing page if she's able to field any of that lady Jackie left his keys in his early to this game feels very difficult for them to come back through all agreed to have the practice going to come in through from scrims maybe they got some good games in a bill has not shown that style a lot throughout the year they're much normally a consistent teen budding light came through the same as I can find something supposed to be I think and as I can get a pretty good for himself will see if they can make that difference and find those sides in the back line makes his first appearance as well here on the Predator drag it says other is a lot of just going to frost a board here in the mid lane in the bottling with the Leona and the Rye there's a lot of set up for this gragasin it is certainly something where they could I make an early aggressive way and rookie already starting dominance here in the mid lane again for you and he's also going biscuits so he is going to be able to have the additional sustained and perhaps a secure himself an early dinnerhe is also paid the cleanse tag that means he's not going to be able to steep tea back into Lansing maybe an early it. Feeling that be able to just sit there and wait for the probably say that is a fair that I am coming into I like the choice from Rookie I do think that right now nothing has the world is usually stop bottom line is off CC gas mid-length off you know 1850s at this stage of the game he's just a test a very good job of shadowing the bottom side of the map and just making sure that these Lanes don't come on the pressure cuz I'm most probably gauge is going to put into the Gangplank and this will just be a bomb test here comes to the Barclay no part of you on your lot of damage to his dominancepromise later this early on to be able to take down tree you already looking a bit Grim Heroes IG also setting up for a dive on the no flash afromoji so likely to happen here we go 3 vs 2 The Flash goes down south. I don't even go into the flash list I guess they just make sure they take down the Haley tareyton I even more so as to why this is a great start to the game by Victor gaming really is it just great execution from them forcing out the summoner's committing on that. They already had a huge advantage in the bottom Lane and you're the solo kill one more time you had already been choked out pretty low and reused has account to pick in this matchup this is rookie wide picking rice someone that is good with Jakob distance that without it and just do not really know if you wanted to level 5 and still able to pick up at 2coffee flour at all to not only does real good solar field he loses his flash I certainly is potential to attack that lane once more I from the side of name who also didn't even have to finish flash on the bottom side and has a predator Boots available as well actually pushed the shrine that was an ultimate can't trade back just yet but niggars I can run for a second tank of a game and then at the end of waiting around to see each other someday and then has flash be needs bit Predator still on Wheel he pulled the trigger so but I don't know there's about what does not have a damaged to kill as it gets filled Away by Sunday over a hundred thieves come out on top there and what is the two flashes of Predator blowing the Gangplank ultimate so no credit 200d Zonda is in the right place at the right time to this timestop this and get more over as long as so that's a great collapse coming through from a hundred things you could say the it actually looking for a rotation play do you want me to lot of damage but where you will go down bring the cleanse and re-engage is almost enough to kill as befitting a bit louder now and a walkthrough for the fierce bilitool turn off though and watch out for the damaged my Tri-Rail want to separate and is going to be on top of them they're so damn it do you know for real I'm making it look easy the one be to chasing them down 3 was starting to fight at Full House with rookies out of vision in that bush jumps out about two-thirds of his health right off the bat expensive cleanse I just know these guys do not have a lot of resources here you see without weights out the spell shield
Azazel has to be at the back of the month at least of the Cloud 9 80 Karat and let's see what comes through for swirl the girls have first pick here they chose blue side and the bands coming through vents Durant staying in the lineup they removing some of those high damage range gun glue from the behind back side to Leah Kindred both o&o flaming fish out who have to be shifted around because of counterfeit Jensen can guarantee and sells the best possible matchup R&G I want to see what they had to get rid of to ensure that's too bad I like that the respect to what was the skin pick both are goats and eight parts of both available and would imagine the Angie Willis in Split six. Once again just like they did last time and say you know what you don't have your same kind of it this time around Alex Ulrich on everything still available right now if R&G once again take desire phone fixes that. I know I'm there for to try and split up the loudest you or feel like it is a blue slide drop on a patchyou know right side has been stepping up now of course not in a very big mlxg MSI but has it now here in the decider for the first speed out of the group. It's going to be incredibly scary teams was other parts of the bracket C9 weather going to look for Here original arrival into the LPL when he started surprising table was picking strange Champions I've been doing strange things you know nothing he doesn't take before level 6 why is it die down in my bottom line is I over-extended back the bomb 265 South underestimate the fact that he will still play a very aggressively game the Cloud 9 what are they going to look for here at the dedicated jungler and leaves in our Graves and will it be that work on later on does that gets going away by R&D lots of questions to answer in this draft as time ticks down and no they will look for thrash for or the planning for ways to save against the not so I think that's why aren't you liked it upbest thing listen to put way more priority on getting his Ira Khan bought me because if you don't then we're just going to steal one of the components away from you all were going to pick fraction to an already shown that we can play it so timeline events going to the next level of thinking thing where you know what if we take the trash out the fourth what have you got left Shane is taking away our house if they can wait till I'm 10 she's taken away wait till we can get a really strong TV to guarantee this is a zone that is still up and available we have seen it throughout the tournament as the answer to this maybe they just play omage to these eliminated lck team picked himself out something up like a range support Prime bully d'Alene I think that they still options down that in this position and of course they get the chance to drive a truck so is the hacker and snap call is it that's the big question for me and I will say the wall I do like the pic when it's an electrician hands Cloud 9 Zip drive to 131 stop earlier and was able to play towards back spring so if they do you want to go for it again I hope that they go morphewhy angles that seems to be more of that strength so far in the second round of this group I have a great team fight and argue be much better one than this Lucinda they're going to go ahead and quickly take off this building and now he's mine atrox is flexible we've seen plenty of a truck mid here and I'm still waiting for Lucian mid to come out I feel like I could be the match if it has a lien in particular but we'll wait to see of course I don't have any pot Lane band the Midland band instead of Jensen more or less lines of billions I wonder how far they attacked Dow who is Champion cool because while Snapchatting can be created in the only game you don't expect him to go towards the midline I would expect that they could be a 131 come coming out of our energy while solution doesn't lend itself towards that they do have the ability now to drag Gillian into a sign language Billy and does not want to be able to do so I think it's ever a lot of options open R&G on the flip side I think cloud 9 just must stick with a tampon in the death ball the ability to get everyone on the same page and then counter-attack brilliantly as we same throughout today's play keeping my eyes on how I do you round this out as well because it looks like to take out do they have you already have the zillion and the mid they could do the little bit more engage in that composition right now cuz outside of the stress you don't really have that many ways to start a fight I like the Synergy between a zillion I think it does give you some early play make a potential to enable you to play through your fault line we're likely here maybe even the Scion as well but a dedicated tank top laner I think does make sense lead the 131 kind of character and I know you can probably defend mid lane by SIA through difficulties I do expect a tank to play hard and Gage Blue Diamond in the Back line but we'll see if aren't you can carry the load and there is that work on picked up the right at the bottom line of RNG and now they just waiting on child who is picking does he go to look something like a cinder in trying once again shall be in the lane early start trying to pressure not all that great in civilian as the game progresses just because of the revive hatchets but we still free up some aggression down into this bottom line that's the one of the go Paisa and move Evolution around will see 3 seconds ago no syndra is going to be the graph most likely time goes through it will be loosed York on bottom and Sandra and MIT single-target single member it's very easy for a zillion to say well you know what I'm just going to save the tax to revive him and now the singer loses its value and he fights so I feel like I was mainly doing it for Lanes Frank it isn't really compliment the 131 but it will allow roll never give up to have that priority in mid in cough and potentially be known as Angel Beats in the Chinese solar que le blanc's syndra his two most played Champions with a monster on that this is arguably one of the most important games played at world so far it's R&G get out of first see they can guarantee that they will have an easy a run at the bracket State whilst you could still out who they are the best well you want to make it as easy as possible for yourself if you lose he told him it gets the stately harder so if we just think about what it means on a global scale be knocked out of proceed by cloud nine the North American represented when you consider how strong are and you will consider coming in my mind could you so much in terms of their reputation and making a strong run into the world championship this could be such a huge deal for them if they find that up there I don't think I could ever come out of the worlds group stage with a number one seed out of a group this would be a bit historic here and it was also I was a threat to get first see that's an RNG second but that's a lot of hemming and hawing through later on here it is now it's time for the players on the the coaches have shook hands and the fight for the top spot in the group of death is on the line we know vitality and Genji have already fallen in third in prospectively question is can Cloud Nine top of group that contains the MSI Champion orders RNG go exactly where they do at the end of it all the beginning of it all and take this first spot we are ready to go on the rest ladies and gentlemen Royal never give off and Cloud 9 to do battle and I do want to hit on the coach of saying I'm just for a second because made his career in the lck transfer to the LPL and became the king of the region with PDG winning MSI Nel transforms a rookie C9 lineup into the potential number one seed from the group of death so much praise has to go to Worlds rated he has given his team a very similar drop and now it is on the players to execute I'm really excited for this game we see Jensen with the zillion pick once again won't have a huge amount of pressure in the early laning phase very much what you expect but it is a huge pics. C9 and how they like to pray cuz you so much by potential speeding up that has been jar allowing him to dive on two families like the cinder in these jeans by giving him that Revival option I mean 69 can be very dangerous in these fights at that is still a whiles away and when you are a zillion facing off against this Sandra in the Midland early-game threat is going to be on the side of Sandra Spence Karen has played most of these games this year with goldenglue Jensen has been playing a lot with lava this is the Jensen blabber style of aggressive jungle we have to see where that's any points because that mid-length at least until Level 6 is heavily R&G Paving so you're not going to push the wave in early at all just a few bottles now they start with it as they see who is Ian Ben Geren where start it isn't enough all ready for this evening to do this one far above-average bike if he goes to that Black Cleaver and we mentioned already this means Lane to do this could be the time to stop for this one is Jensen needs to think a minion finds a bit there the minion will fall and he has no chase guy who pushed out to miss a bit of XP but not too much so smart ass Yahoo to play Tool's the top slide because he had a vision on the outside wall now I see it was the ending trying to look for a bit of a trade PetSmart from Jack position to weigh to not run the risk it as well he still wants to have that early learning phase of the zillion but it's very Olin for Champion that later on in the game kind of feels a lot to mitigate your value in private TruGreen very strong want to go back to you notes solution pack is going to have a busy is that late-game insurance policy that they rely on the plane they've got themselves a pushing Lane in the form of the a trust as well this could be a simile game as to what we just do with the it tried it that three-pronged attack that is able to play sober up in the lane to see about leaving pushed in right now that farm is going to go to faculty should be close to equal here with words to make sure he can stay safe and Spence Karen can't go for anything too scary really cool from mlxg because we talked about a lot to me coming out there until he has gone into topside Vision I will take away how usually the most experienced valuable camp on the outside of the major already himself toward that level six Matos while it's not having impact on the lane is doing a good job of providing Beach and information and should be at level six Everly than expected liquor store now it's Titi least 30 burn that to get back in Lanesville feed Isaac missing a lot if they kill does come through has to respect what this could be from Let Me In mlxg cuz I knocked and roll recall and he can stay safe checking back in the bottom Lane A to Z and minks live in a great shot sounds of 80s so far and not showing any type of slowing down here we see this a lot and when they said to be to match of tends to happen sneaky behind in the laning phase that has been kind of hanging around the Lansing from Zazzle what could have been a signal to go in but not going to find it here a flight backwards is still there and Mingo 200hp going to have to cut away turn first floor go to Cloud 9 9 9 hookah most landed I kept in a bit tomorrow or the last so I should say that's be nice trucks didn't know that until they're pretty safe recall kill credit as you mentioned did go to the Jungle expense Karen going to feel happy about this one and I could stop playing around the boat Lane this is where they had issues the first time they met and we said it earlier in the day sneaky and these were able to mitigate the pressure but now they've actually found themselves and nearly killed Guardian pretty good Arun is very crucial and solution to this one plays out we're going to have basil through the lamps in back immediately flashing for the plate and it was something rather than try and shut down Target McKnight town on the rakan kill that is still an advantage in the bottom line for Tuesday also I mean I talked about it a lot so far but the smoothness of the Autumn pop pollution you know the fact that I feel as well as attack damage do you get a tax paid on the 1st by as well just makes you feel a lot more comfortable in that lady face look worse than 1/2 HP let me of course has the ultimate phrase easy in and let you know she is not hatching a word in this brush licorice is Wayback Lane is going to be a slow walk that is one of the most obvious that outside think I've ever say Dallas Telegraph play I think of the top. Of licorice respecting it is well going to back away it's been a little bit more is gold very early on aboot sent to be better Cloud 9 while you can see Jensen is even the games Sandra inmates in the top side of Matt licorice is now down 15cs but let me will go back to Baseline Liquors from clothes I got a little bit more so far for the Goldie's is going well then mitigating this early learning strengths on you does have his most impressive and you can say now they feel like I have pressure in the back memes that show who feel totally safe and Karen have to be a little bit careful on this one is it keeps running backwards it's not going to be slow down there will be no reason to Old the reason the ultimate answer answering and guarantee Jensen how do you say salty that means it went to level six times through now but mlxg there's a window for them to
is a tiebreaker vs. Vitality Genji's types of play ambition for at least one of the games they needed to check whether they had been rolling with the right line up I think it was a little bit of a failure and they have made the right choice and bringing in Bianca Jones law for that final game of World and even though Genji are eliminated they still hold the state of this group in their hand if they do VR ngrg must play a tiebreaker as you said was my pality for the right to join Top bait and what we do next day would be for the lck then to knock out or help knockout Yelp you'll never one as correct is locked in right away for me wow that is a bulb lamp pink I get spent all these support to disband off the table fitted wanted to make sure that they can get the next fast but you would imagine change the continent to take Philly do I make it Priority on the jumpinteresting out of RNA because I say we need to free up some meat and tell play in case we need to be able to get some more than rolling in this we've already highlighted how important let me in jail who have played in the series the ability to generate some of that might be dropped already damaged at 4 to hear the irelia grab them pretty early and and there really aren't any midlane bands a way in or more than us just a couple of jungle picks out so a lot of options here DemolitionRanch Yahoo want to punish does irelia is still available in the goes to take for Tuesday but when you draft in the threats you're getting yourself and orange tile that looking to go for killed they looking for Lane dominant and why you can Flex it a truck supposed and mid RNG I definitely coming in with a new more aggressive game plan on my way to go in the first phase key or baited breath around everyone watching he ran off as well as our weakest be with oranges third pick will be and it is going to be more Furley aggression towards 2018 debut on Olaf something that at level 16 challenge totally over a lot of a neutral objectives bomb to the symbol of rank as well I'm like a g is one of the Jungle is it has very creative pop something that doesn't normally take the ability to capitalize upon because he does just put the whole jungle on Farm but interested to see if he had something a little bit more aggression and Genji they drafted themselves reflux makes right now being able to get into the jungle irelia can go and support there's a lot of flexibility in the draft of the board get eliminated from the pool so you don't have that phone call side of them at the same time we can both to have especially given the fact that if it is irelia mid hey you can't even throw a truck into that match up if you want to get very spotty well the last regularly-scheduled game of this group is going to wait on the bus lanes Harry Potter ruler and Aries and I say it because they play with the Marksman in the world ruler probably the biggest carry for Genji and obviously the same for Royal and there's a lot left to grab here only diet and type it off the table and ruler wants to oppress early on Lucian is picked up thought you would have imagined that this will be the Lucian stand bought Lane Ford in the irelia will likely go talk in my eyes and I'm still waiting for that midlane pic but again so much flexibility in the Draft Virginia have gone for themselves RNG now you would imagine they'll look to continue with the aggression they've already drafted in the year of the game you can see lord of the Harvest that was going for that is going to be an exciting pick and certainly bring for us to see if men gets caught a little bit too far for words but you have so much kills rat hear of flash Play The Marshall Kansas jumping up and I Marshall boys I should stay in his keeping up and getting oakhills that is absolutely possible here we can have an incredibly explosive Autumn Lane and a lot of meat right now he's going to be around for of the bottling at 2:40 if you want to crush Suzy 3 level 5 Nami is stimulate Haru playing that to the other games Emma lachy on the Olaf Roula and 80 cars at trying to had questionable performances throughout this group stages ups and downs for sure is going to be going toe-to-toe with Uzi Lucian against Calista Genji that sank that final game they are here to play this is just going to be insanely exciting game Royal never give up the win will be the second team locked in the quarterfinals what happened Genji can force a tiebreaker for second and Genji throw it all out the way this will be their last game of World the defending world champions are knocked out in the group stage draw on their way out of it can hobble RNG and North America is Hope and call JJ with a pocket pic of the Nami could also deny the chance of that tie breaker for the first aid and just a cloud 9 2 walkthrough on the inverse of what I think it's many pundits would have thought would be the outcome of this group and we might be in South Korea but those are some R&G banners the Chinese fans always come through to see their teams play Live no matter where worlds are MSI or anything else is this is going to be exciting we are on the river Royal never give up the MSI Champions Genji the defending world champion and they're going to battle for us right now the last time these two teams met in the group stages it was a close back and forth ing start off with an entities Genji ultimate be a single m514 RNG listen to that crowd why do the lines so that he'll seek a lineup of Genji that Wells run has been cut short regardless of the outcome of this match I don't think many people would have foreseen this out, however this could be a blow to the LPL when I'm not getting the favorites for world the favorites of the LPL Adam Cruz in first place at this stage of the told him it would already be in upset and we could see them just bumped heads it's already spicy but three are coming down Main kind of Senses this he's going to be coming out for an election is only rented once it's not his on scuba instructor can you got some wings waiting for a bit more of its Bottom Now by show who walks away but RNC start the game 500 gold in the lead at what was supposed to be 8 orange and horribly wrong the fresh takes the brunt of the damage picks up his taxes and chases down to Genji members who they lose his flash orange golfers glad I'm with Gotti and they just wasn't the damage was no real Precious exhorted exerted on him not wanting to be Advantage early on in the chamber when you give it over to mxp the wild Cod RNG he can take over an early game and even for JJ's Wedding Bell but she gives away a lot of land controlled normally she's so good because you learned the heel and you bounced off your opponent's and ruler wins every trade for free instead the bubble does not pay off here in this little one arm flailing plus Guardian it's just such a fucken called both at level 1 is bre-x OnPoint mlxg starts the game Ride The crucial summon spells but got used 1/4 to Z that means the Harley could look for an early gank down tools the boss fight off the map he could look to try and help this Genji about laying into the game and you can get an advance as you can see him a hovering around off the clearing out his blue bus with no vision for the size of RNG Haruka turn this around but you have to be here the play because people still shots mess and I are relying on either a bubble or flake to get the party started and you were there at the same time as the Olaf so dank he's going to turn that I need to make sure the bacon is set first president what is already happened play Tequila comes through right now just gave 800 apart slowed a bit more orange than just the little one have you believe if you can see an extra Camp there for Emily she's in a full wave of farm lead for let me is the bot Lane is recalled out for Royal and he's back in with a control board in the longsword to help make sure he can keep that lean priority level threes all around the bottom Drive Midland holding equal and this is when he doesn't have time to spell he will be willing to go back in shop on train. It's already asleep when it was something like that yes she would even go back and grab pickaxe plus a credit card is a player that is willing to mix up the fields depending on what the state of the game currently looks like he knows that he hasn't got something to spell available. The longer he can spend out of that lane the more it could benefit in the long run 16 to the 1st to make a flight going to be spotted By The Sword as it comes up through this River and the control word now shuts off that vision and going to create some more scare in that Genji bought me what is a transport having a very good time and now I'm like she is doing what he can to reclaim some control of the butt side of an app that you can see that after the early Shenanigans the wind down and there was little to no vision we saw very early bass coming out from A to Z getting his Burley Idaho funk soul brother and and now you just get little across the river double control towards one more than the river wormwood on the blue bus and not a potential tank onto the flash goes to Z becomes a lot harder without a problem normally the Genji play style have been one of giving up very little and having Lain priority interet leads and see if they do get some gangster is Hard Knocks down a quick Spencer Nolan what's the next move is that Ward and many other start falling off and now it is gentian when Joyce darkness in this time but can like she feel safe with electronic control board back and maybe they'll be okay Yahoo also has a lot of control over the Middle Lane irelia doesn't have that level of way you could be able to match the sunroom you can just found a lot of her abilities very early on into the landing phase keep Crown underneath his power and I mean that he can move with if you meet this one for One More Time by The Substitute getting me involved early trying to generate a lady of good stuff back from an electric yes it is a one-for-one but Bruce of the you're putting Crown behind a note he's not running the cleanse in this matchup the same CC can come out very easily from out of town he isn't Nelly Champion in the setup is very clean but a good response from crab utilizing that ignites haven't taken advantage of the W-2 maximized is down and out enables him to go to return kill R&G still leads to kill school teams have so much faith in the LPL off of oranges if you because you saw that they were able tool rental control back of a river through the wards were able to once again make a good place for lack of vision for chinchillas able to generate this is an area that historically the lck lineups has Supreme in that vision control and I think that small glimpse is of the Brilliance of R&G like that he'll make them one of the favorites at this toilet regardless of the fact that falling down Oxford today certainly incredible team and our flight towards the strip episode has to push back mlxg and cuvaison his way down to earth to hear is let me hear to join in now Crown the first of reinforcement 323is show who joined into a blast go right back out but that gives members advantage to R&G they are controlled the middle age divided and conquered maybe as he has to go away troubles all said though it's really one for the Red Bluff and Harlow have to give away this control you have to believe and indeed I'm like she grabs it and is able to walk away surprised that you didn't have ultimate I guess you don't want to go toe-to-toe with another game Olaf for I know the game a truck so instead Genji did concede that are all the jungle and that slowly falling further and further behind a 1,000 gold he's not in the pockets of R & G & M electric heat looking to continue fresh air into Harvey Show me another point was the fact that so much of the area had already been working around the Hara was just running out of space to be able to generate significant damage you can see all the circles already placed around the right ba pay go again on the crown yeah they threatened that one but I'm not going to come through in the past in is the simple wave beer makes midlane + 11 CS stop playing Elmo stop 20 and its really grab this bit of farm he'll still be down 10 all is said and done Calista this is where I think oranges that are scary as because this time around they have legitimately three shooting threats on the map to the whole accelerated old can play that game and we'll see whether the Genji lineup can repel them well it's going to try for something at the very beginning get famous in the shower who just way through as it gets back out beginning of Damages are there is traffic going to take the recall now and maybe not ing right now waiting all across the board huge TS advance
loser has a chance if Genji beats are in another time when we were in the Vixen band that we sent and right now I want to see how Cloud Cloud9 go because I do agree that certain parts of the map they should be reactive I think it is primarily around the bottom line out of a licorice at the moment it's playing like a man possessed you do when it is on another level but it comes to where he's paying me and I think the cloud nine me to empower that rookie the play that has been the most consistent over this year and it looks like right I'll respect towards the top mine off Cloud 9 those 8% taken off the board first I'm not denying way the irelia a specific Target one of the things like the alista open which I believe I talked to you should look Too Faced on fasels previous game performance and it is gone all be bought later is as far as the farmers are left in the tire right away lockedCloud9 sneaky to answer desired work on with things like gin Tom kench but with Tom Ken's taken off the board to use then look to try and deny the wreck on Old you find the other answers summer considered Morgana to be a pretty solid pick as a response but to be a good answer as well as Raven and thresh are available on the Champions I've been doing them today and Raven is locked in a Tilla quite the world so far by faith and this is what you must love about your mother as a coach the ability to empower he's plays 2K take comfort in the biggest game of the year for this for that is such a brave move for Vitality go to a stage of the game I mean things like nautilis we've seen used to go to the drive-in it's just a holeopen playbook and yet he still trusts you for them when I ask you certainly doesn't we'll see how that the draft earlier in the day they will position electric template to great effect by using the cream of the crop is because it allows the teams who plays their style of Champions who else wants to play Draven threats everything else on the table. They're from your compositions the best styles for their own team to lock that spot at 4 into into the quarter-finals Vitality sticking to their style Cloud9 sticking today as neither midlane at has been locked in yet had a fantastic tournament so far will be going up against who's been playing out of heremine today and that's what I want to talk about how much is Jensen feeling it right now is he willing to go at the Italian Stallion is it going to be and now they carry because this is eerily similar to they called the Cloud 9 beat Genji with earlier today and in that matchup perfect Catalyst to get them going in the right direction what's a mid laner of slab not have a lot of Jensen's pics are not allowed right now the LeBlanc was banned Away by has been specifically and blinding syndra can always be scary. Kind of benefit of red side if you can always count affect at least one of those Lanes waiting to see if Jen and goes ba tour Top Lane by Sally want to pick one Champion for themselves of course the Scion already there I expect a jungle next up as a band away here I'm curious as to what Direction tickets will go I'd be surprised. Thing like the Kindred for the game what is already a pretty strong guy on the back line called that Cambridge ultimate tan off of valueTomcats rolling in the front line Direction they are going to be good but I laid all that great at going backwards with the exception of correct not really the case billion to make the time even friends in the top light or does it signal morehart engage with a champion like or what this been going in the bottom line is lots of ways T9 can shift this composition from 12223 carry these Cloud Nine track the amazing record that they had during the regular season Jensen on since the Cloud 9 worlds edit up against police game with your pants outfit and you have to respect to be in the first place they play that style they play but work for them they said forget the medicine that perfectly clear all about picking what we know and right now zero to the top world's 2018 they were not here they are why do pump up State NBA Gretchen maintain the game plan I'm so excited on the quarter-finals of this world championships do walk-in Topic in the last time these teams met it was probably the biggest comeback of world this year a massive effort by C9 to take down Vitality there and I thought maybe that was Bo call me when North America would get from this group seen our projected that sent you the number for down here but have a chance of being number one of course so does Vitality after some incredible for words is through a bunch of year in rookies cu9 vs. Vitality North America and Europe to lock the first spot in the top face and it is Comfort down the line for each player and to tell the story of this Cloud 9 Squad having to come in as North America 3rd seed after it is zoster is the offense struggling through the flaying state early on in the group and look like they were only going to be able to grab a victories off the other end of you-know-what out of the clutches of defeat the today that turned it around that started that come back and make the biggest potential so good it was so good against RNG they're going to try it again C9 absolutely beautiful away parvo shot he used his flash to get in behind basil they set up the Trap but they aren't able to find first level result in a likely Redbox going in the favor of Vitality foot already anniversity you bloodthirsty stuff for the flashing right yeah it was very early on he's going to be around to however at this rip-off I got to see what the doctor has to come from sticky nose with the is Leesville tap 1 North in that brush but then those rabbits need a bit harder for Scentsy on either way tickets at least a full Camp ahead and he's not going to fight for the Raptors going to let them go over and since Karen choosing not trade he could have moved up to a fight maybe trade the enemy Red spent his rest but now he's like a pool level behind because I take it he's able to steal away that red buffalo long with the rent account after that match up with Echo you lose all control I thought he was just trying to write the schedule but he wants to get in the NBA starting up tickets inside the jungle is bullying since Karen but liquid is coming downstairs to be 3D won against tickets he's pill fight excuse to its way for the elderly and you got all my stuff on me first place he's going to go down. 4 + 137 game all right let's take a very very quick breather gentleman when we reach out where do we start set up a flash grenade at the biggest thing off the back end of all the kills is it the lane to starting to do in Vitality say but that it is Vitality that has the push across the boys and then starting to go off in theater wall sits game is all about the kills on faceoffs is actually the landing phase which is helping Vitality recognizes if you thinks he can do City it to take advantage of by The Scarlet Ibis to get out then realizes it's going to try this in quite where I want it and then the Chase comes down from Jensen and licorice what's happening around the mid lane Zanesville trace the torture messes up and get changed to find the killed flashing and get a nice early payday in the Trudy to really nice stuff by him the first Rico going to come through for sneaky as he should have been to Canada wave take the defects of time but double longsword for him until of course going to be a lot richer here and pretty close Waze vs overly friendly. Children that Rico because he heard you got the money for that plus refillable or any of those small trick if he wants to pick up there while we got to think about what it means to the Vitality Raven Echo they want to be ahead Strahan still goes extremely well with just a tiny bit of gold after wants to be that split for strength so the sooner he gets those items as soon as you can walk to the sideline and assume that he could do what just do Kate does that where is. C9 you kind of expect him to fall behind in the early Lane in space do you have the ability to attack Sidelines because I do have things like the things as well as an oxidation combo who's going to play at the house be able to pick your time on the map you don't want to give too much away in response to happy ability to generate these pics just needs to be with the right set up the first Rico the film off of the top winners now they both save TP both the liquor since and the Cowboys start strength they are armed up there ready to go cuz they fight in the bottom side with holographic players event it seems likely both jungles not shadowing down your pick a spotted on the ward what's got to control yourself by the hook just give me the fight right away it's not a lot of damage he's going to stay alive and no TVs burn they're going to stay up just yet but they look around tickets you can see here behind the side seat what's a teepee down there going to go to the play right away it's going to be a slow vehicle down now forced to face Malik rounded ability if you throw it under that teleport it puts it on the full cool down so I can I didn't cancel that himself what was licorice with the heads-up play Red with ever wanted to be able to go if it's still the pressure is on skill you have the pushing Lane and vitality first of these places that was crucial is what we will get a replay of what happened to have a charge of going into the brush to try and get the t t and is exactly as you described on the interrupt coming in from licorice chews face with the ball slide kind of slowing down this Noble for Vitality really happy to stop to the bread. The second time around Spencer in season has been a growth and he's like I don't have control of much of anything here refers to as basil comes in Jacksonville join but there's already an echo this is vitality how much straight line is playing that game on the stage and keeping up a little bit of them are spies into the Animus that's was saying no need to try and force against Cloud 9 because you know they're going to do it to you you just have to be ready to react and in this instance they prepare for the White Album Beatles the Redbox and C9 respond accordingly they find themselves another kills but the cold sober even down to the waving their one Siesta Park in the mid side top length Plus for 4, Sharp and of course plus a lot down here is a tell us up 13 * 23 as I can actually count numbers and I know the tens place is and when you look at what a 1-3-1 compass able to do there's multiple areas you attach can either attack of side lengths something like if the echo that goes down top light on bottom lights and maybe try and take him out and potentially look too aggressive fun is the midline weather 3 is going to be we say seems like C9 actually this torment not respect that get 4th on and go down they have sucked I just being able to run
more of a sample size from this number one PCS I was very impressed I have a say in particular by Bruce and Mission we're just farming like absolute monster as soon as they were forming something like 12:30 at for a minute against Team Liquid which is just ridiculous it was like to Z levels hope dies so I'm really interested to watch them as soon as you two are the heavy favorites for this grouping in assuming is looking to clean up some more wins here after they want to such a close game against you too and what the hell is just with the win of teal over GT with means I win hair ties you prefer the group based on the record so far it has been good enough make it happen here as well only a couple of Carrie Topolino's coming out on the Machi side we'll see if maybe the jacks or something comes down that was a bigplay for a bit earlier here as well and I want to see the Jack looks like of course for protecting is there have been some concerns about PK and doesn't really focus on helping him out so it is to us play Championship Justin band are they are on the right side of the couch trying to say because Pick 4 last of my she doesn't usually do that they regularly prioritize mission who is kind of their big star player he is a guy who's a very very strong laning bit later he doesn't have a lot of activity on the map that generally speaking but he creates big Pharma advantages and he pays that back by putting out big-time out the damage in the team fights sofm going to grab the nidalee he played this I believe against Team Liquid yesterday was massively ahead of rocks up on nearly doubling his farm and we'll see if he can put on another huge performance year against Gemini and and marchingRock summer split still a chance in the people were looking at their nidalee definitely a high prize Evelyn and Lilia would be kind of the next in the tier list if you're looking at Gray's Italy being feared want to do you want two magic damage juggler that's kind of that will be that comes through for Gemini or not regardless polar bear is more likely to be a jungle pick here just my intuition base in the garage so far and we still come through for real though they both him and Gemini have your 5 take place on the champion so has been pretty common for both and it is the third most played 4pk with his most played Champions already being banned out by Tim hinh I wouldn't be shocked if they just wanted to secure this to try to protect him a little bit in the draft because they said they usually are lock picking for Mission they're trying to protect him as much as possible will be interesting to see if Ben wants to take something that he considers to be a bit of the counter picks try to go for an aggressive matchup against BK because I found love to play out there and Jacksonthe volunteer stunt Mountain Auto attack that Q is blocked by Counter-Strike I'm so it is actually very very easy to prevent that you evolve there goes into like his running stance other things very clear animation Templar can react to that and prevent it. This could be a Flector the jungle now that Jack's been locked and you could go to wear something like the shed I do like that both positively and just kind of doesn't idea to try to protect BK a little bit more I think that Jack has a better match up your brother has a better match up in Two Jacks and you don't have to win that one be one right you can just kind of withstand it you can build some wave clear and try to make Place Elsewhere on the map I think that is probably going to be the game plan here for PK and just shows the powers of flex pics there a little bit because I do believe that Jack was locked in really hasn't answered of all there has been a good drops play Kieran and I'm curious how the game's going to play it because we know it's unless you're doingclear plates than into waves and then come back at the headlines or by the way up an item on you in this was done dusted so I will do that for him his rookie year in the LPL sitting top laner if you speak Mandarin. Wrong with Carlos but a banth with throughout the bottom Lane right now you can see the porch with Ajax Carrie filla composition of the song self double band on that side I mean while yet is there any planets out of Mission to call leave and away we don't know what the Middle Lane answer to Angel Center is going to be but he is most to go to call Ian van zuylen off and we coming through as well and Echo is something that I don't know if Mission would really go through it you didn't actually play it regionally but you know he could go to something like his Zoe is Oriana of those two have been pretty problemfor him abandoned house on his kind of those those AP matchups mortgage Pacific counter you know kassadin would be pretty risky pic I think you again soon in who can play so fast but that is going to happen. Regardless in your really building towards just 535 late game of this was one of the common picks Forum it and it does kind of fit is play solidly said he's looking to farm it out to the war is the team fights where he is really really good and they have built already a very beefy Frontline with their what we are assuming our shopping and jungle radical equations for in all this but we're not really going to consider that for now and locking there and a lot of the only reliable and Gage is Sword Art playing for freaking ever he's such a better in here in the lineup but he's the only one with a son that's a longer range in the sky of the week and that one's only so good meanwhilebut if I forget the lead in top link you just play around the 131 you play split and that will be hard to deal with exactly like okay we're going to go away from the Jack Bright of a strong to Stand United onto to go in to work on comes in Qualicum pop the ultimate get the stand United to try to fly in and Harden gate on Champions such as the syndra to pick them off while Jackson is Eileen trying to create Avengers that's what they're really looking to do and we'll see if they are going to be able to rate those types of advantages or if doing or going to be able to really just escalate the lead instop playing no pick up the pace in the early games we thought it was Ben actually playing and he was like weeks the Jackson still beer and Ben and that's what band has been one of those deadly object will combos in the LPL are they can snowball almost any Lane it feels like so Geminis going to have to do a good job protecting pk-2 I'm always going to be in Port here as yeah there's a lot of really volatile Lanes right there right now in Midland is there pretty close back and forth Michigan some decent trades with his soldiers that ain't looking good job for the night's shield in to trade for PK means you got a small healthfleet up there has been go through his first couple of oceans thanks. That should say he could find a regen back up through his door and shield been trying to do here is he's actually destroying a hard shove these early waves so that it'll bounce and on the time and he expects Gemini to be up on the top side the wave will be pushing forwards it what that lets you do is just sit back and play it more defensively. If you can get it to crash you know the weight is going to come to you if you don't have to expose yourself at 2 at Aunt Polly Bergen and Candy types of things they also spotted Hawk Shop coming through from Bruce to full knowledge of where he is Gemma is heading up towards the top side but I'm the wave does not look like it was actually able to get that Full Bounce in make it right away clean as you say it never had a chance of flash away on the checks that was really well done there quick Counter-Strike came out for Benny was trying to trade a resume to PK pushing that Wave 3 didn't have any Vision know he had no word for himself in that River and despite the fact that you possibly stock jumped away PK follow up with the flash on the top flash nails that Gemini flashes in chains that also been couldn't get over the wall that was just very well done and good lean management here from PK to not allow the crash come through tonight wow that reset to happen and I've been getting punished for being very overaggressive something that a lot of people were saying should have happened to him in that TL game and did not this time he able to punish have a good talk flash to follow of course it was to flash with a kill then see if he's back in and he's in for the Scott the longest word from his farm and plug back in late and we'll see when PK makes his recalls going to be now he's really Crystal DK's up Ruby Crystal and down a flash if there's going to be more action later on that's the only difference in his Lane so far cuz he only got the assist there then put in that much farther ahead but I. Is blade plus the boots come in here for Gemini means he is really ready to go for round 2 and not spot it so if it messes up at all here I should be fine there you go you can Counter Strike that Halle Berry son did she kill off the war to eliminate any chance of using that out for elite strike again later on little bit of pressure doesn't really matter now or later on if you can turn that into a completed item because you're the actual thing you get from these potions is going to be more valuable than 255 HP fuel from a ruby Crystal you get a full tick ocean you see how he is never more like 5 600 Health once I thought exactly. But yeah, but without the dark Zone without putting a Counterstrike means he will be gone before and Ben cat show back up the train comes through with the counter was bullying and Top Lane is over beautifully done there by PK and Gemini so he walks Point Blank and that's exactly what you want to do and it's a lot of cases what people do is to watch Point Blank not hit the Jacks then he Parts his Counter-Strike then you tan after in this case he saw he was right Pointe Blank on the Range and it says you know what fan you can tree activist and Ben doesn't flash it don't get the Counter Strike Up and as a result he has been dismantled in this Lane there was a lying on him for the split push and this is a dominating we from Achi not just because of the gold but because of how this competition is supposed to function it revolves so heavily around Bend being able to win the sidelines and now he's going to get there but I want now look at that time looking at the recall that once I'm just got he went cold here just sidestep koala what a beautiful kill with a 17 Millie's actually he's been worse despite how well toppling has been going your massive CF Advantage Plus he's the one that got the kill we have to remember that she didn't actually get either of those killed both of them went to the nursery while it is still very beneficial to shut down at Jack's it's Gemini who's got to try to make the most of the girl that did get dumped into him from it will see how much you guys going for a depressive starred in in a matchup that again know they are are really considered big underdogs here I want to bring up the fact that to your Cole what's the recall from one phone which means they had $1,300 and was like I'm sailing where I'm going to sacrifice all the controls and let you do whatever you want to me hear Bruce whenever he wants to can shove in the wave take a like 2,000 gold recall if you back in and we weren't CP that should be a drink I want to see Maji they haven't bought do they have in top length that I agree you know what one of the things is because Joe and I spent so much time outside they obviously haven't been able to do that yet now maybe they feel like you're in a spot we can start playing two words besides you know if you go towards that dragon now you have stayed United Jack's can't match with you pee so I agree I think that would be a really nice way to play it if I put some pressure on where to get a replay of what was the social long-range god of the week he knew we had it the orbs route immediate flash through when he saw that Skyler week was going to land pops the out the angel very well played on that one be one I like the PK is also not going for the Sunfire just build straight towards the Titanic that is going to help you maintain your lie in the 1D One for quite a long time because you have that big gold leaf at the 426 pasta try to be even larger lead marches going to be outside cuz injectors going on before the Jackson friend truly just want to do something to you say the S Logan call Tiara is really just hang out we're scaling where to play for late Jack's want to get those items are going to wait for that and I taken orally dragons you're putting a little bit of time with the right thing alright challenge at the Third Dragon so in x amount of minutes you're going to have to come here and meet me in and fight for it they don't do that they can just got to continue to extend their gold leaf butt yeah we could just be suiting every time you go to Dragons if you wait too long just ignore it in farm for gold hardside step there and it actually means that you'll have to give up on the roof. There was well as it's going to be as beer Recall now for mission is honey still down 14 lbs in the book getting pushed in. Going to be some Farm denied do not going to hold us back to can missions actually okay I've got to walk back all right just just just got the way and I'll be there don't worry about it as the Staffing people are coming through for Bruce he is going for the more engage style here and he certainly is erc20 get damaged in a mid to late game team fight so it's right there going to have to be the team
I'm so far both teams have been rising to the occasion Cloud 9 now get their opportunity to be able to do that against RNG this should be a great man to look absolutely should be Cloud 9 has very very bad really games none worse than the match against R&G back in the first week but they have shown a little bit of better fortitude in the first 20 minutes here today and we'll see if they can hold up against Uzi and then because Nikki's they both have been having bad Lenny faces and I think so much was through Jensen that Catalyst in the midline of the ability to get the early game finally rolling in that day but he had done it throughout the play in fade he hasn't really thinking on that many of the stuff I like the fact that they got away from the galio that they headed back towards the LeBlanc and now shall who a player that has risen to the occasion on big stages internationally as he's worth not answering because I tend to form Disturbia Terry match up in 2 pics in Vans and Royal never give up giving some respect to the landing phase Draven Bandolino Nocturne very standard for C9 to run dive heavy compositebackroom still up I don't expect a talk to be picked as a result try to deny even more of those pics and it leaves us with the you would think Tyson's first pic that says Nikki has not been leaning too well on the Champions instead of this Fresh Beat Band Roofing flea make from cloud nine things like new. Auntie April's are available as well and you would imagine that Kevin, I have shown a counter to both of them than more than happy to let either one of them through to Z on Ty's to be no surprise no one picks and bans you got the best player in the coming through at us where the road is he is set up to carry even on Chancellor and this is interesting because when he was put in the situation he also defaulted back to a civil case so I wonder what is the next kid of the 80Perry Lanes Heath whether it is something like a virus something like a gene that we've seen a lot of whether they do just goes at like game scaling the last time we still plan on going up against in the plains lissandra the tank lissandra as a means of dealing with it and why you don't win the lane you really don't lose it and you can access the front line later on to the game but for the Civil that you were talking about it's going I wonder if they still have that in mind whether or not they course you're thinking okay I'm going to go with the aatrox championlooks to be a bit more like maybe in an orange game even when you've got more damage out what else were you need a front line for the Nuggets being locked in and that's of course going to be flexible screen brightness and support for me between Douglas fir and I think it is one of those pics that right now with being flipped into the sport more often as a support champion pool tend to be more play making right now we have some saying something negative support the most popular house paint on kitchen that has look good but Brougham at the same time hasn't really found his place in the current world met up so I would expect that to be mean to Casa has a very large champion pool and potentially an area where cloud and I can actually see and Olaf but I think that he does have more to show off that very true and right now Royal never give up just targeting the outside of the map giving that got the best possible match of it sounds even signing away the lissandra this surprises me we already talked about it as a means of an answering to the hats they have something in mid-length something like that is currently left out an availablebut they don't want to keep that over to Yahoo given that he did play earlier in the day I became quite ounces is a very viable solution because even though LeBlanc has starkly tainted has proven to be one of the safe of lipase repetitively taken away I also think that you can give a lot of credit to licorice because he is an Innovative and we keep saying if there is a time for another pocket pig that would be right now the Cloud 9 I'm interested to see if the young man has one as well along with the victim and flies account in the looking at in the Kali cake and I Midland could also be sent up towards the top side of the map to one that has been known to play akali into the air and it can be a pretty strong split push threat the question is wolverine look so grab it for themselves and put it in the mid lane or they just went through when you go to carcel by the very best friend was in the world maybe even the best if he can beat score maybe later on in the tournament either way as though they are going to be waiting for the Middle Lane ticket to Darien and less he forgot gets wet down there for xiaohu so Cloud 9Mammoth lock in their lineup Thalia almost certainly is jungling so who's leading the blind pig syndrome most likely and we'll see what top winner cloud and is waiting to pick for licorice afterwards because if you are throwing the gauntlet of potentially taking a match a black and a collie into it however as you mention it has been placed into the top successful yet it's a completely different question in my opinion I completely agree right now, I'm just texting a lot of options available to them we will see Jensen on bats and turn right now they have a lot of stuff they don't really have outside of the ultimate that much more limited than it does allow Jensen to be a little bit further up in the land I think the last time we saw this was actually on Jensen side and on the Assassin was able to play very aggressive if you swapped that especially with a tub flame sheddoes not give the same place is going to be the top latest show who we playing these Sion mid and should be nearly invulnerable against syndrome the puppy comes we thought they had gone away from a dangerous team that we have seen historically but when push comes to shove Royal showing that they still have so much faith in the best player in the world and it was sneaky that was dismantled in the bottom Lane Uzi just told him up hot and it was largely where they snowboard the game frog can sneaky stuff up so far today he's had a great the phone with a code that is built around enabling Uzi and making him the carrier of this team or I'd be on spooky to see how he handles the precious absolutely eyes on the bottom line is is coach Shakeand there's a chance to meet again in a tiebreaker later on at the end of the day there is a chance he's that these teams could battle for first is a lot of seating still up for grabs with an r and g win they guaranteed to be one of the topics to be determined based on the later game Cloud 9 know this love test ahead of them as well however today has been a day for upset and c9mic make that Seaforth in a row if they can Dethrone RNG be raining MSI Champion what most people consider the best team in the world they did follow through against team Vitality C9 going to hope to capitalize on that but there is still a very top Taps Yahoo Louisiana rest of our Angie are absolutely incredible flares Horry have an amazing day of games Cloud 9 vs Royal never give up heads once again groupie will conclude today North America have the right kind Cloud 9 make it to top 8do in two versus three in one only ones you've been eliminated so far and either team it a law still has a chance to battle back through a make their way into this one a lot of play for not a time to lose just yet they're still more games to play for both of these teams has he has a gigantic Frontline in front of him in carcere what are the best lease in the world can set up the early game so well. We talked a lot about oranges composition which is very much protect the guy so protected you have a lot of Meatballs got a lot of skill for the Kaiser and basically you're going to rely on her at once you choose three items A to B. Primary damage be the while the rest of the conversation is engaging but the Cloud 9 they have a couple of early game options they can take advantage with the cinder play making in the mid you do have some set up but would you mind of Tanks Animal of lame person to R&G have in Midland talk it may be difficult 49 to find those early I'm one of the strengths of the Scion pick it as a tall plant is the ability to show about the lane rotates what's a maid rotatewhat's the jungle in create control what we have seen from flash. So I finally told him it is it can replicate that place out in the middle and spit towards bottom they use it to get Betty ahead in those situations trust her and put him on a cat carry to watch list because of how well they've been playing around him well this was the first carry on that list and now shall who gets to visit that way frequently and let's see if they can execute on it and I thought the Red Bluff Police goes over the fence. No issues will wait for next at the pants to come around is Carson's going really buff debuff and then be around the bottom Lane Cypress cuddling up might be had here is the waves are pushing back and forth and then want to step up and the dream scenario this time around is it Cloud 9 get to get to about level five and start shopping outfits wave and being able to control them anyway if you can do that you can minimize a lot since you took so much of the damage last time was it Susie had the better reigning 80 Harry and xayah vs to Kaiser will be with us that still holds true nowprice of a ranch and then it goes back and no harm no foul really they aren't quite able to get the other push the kind of struggling a little bit to the Lane deficit in a civil and this is somewhat what you expect even kysek not considered the strongest laning Champion she can still apply a bit of fresh request you with the amount of zoning controls the garage has been game given that he has control of the button for the time being pressure mink with Boris mean I could not step up at first he weighs 111 to 4-in cso already a great start and we got to leave Fitz just stopped in the vision they know he's there. Christine I can stop this at all is well movie into the outside of the Jungle so much Vision already invest in the side of the map Fallout yes already original reports about it coming into the draft this was the guy that really struggled a gangstas bought land from aren't you the last time we met up with while this is what you would expect in the other laying faceSummoner Shield Bernie's thank you for coming down from Zanesville to let us at least a small issue but look at this car stuff already ready for the first week he was in danger but look how much more Pharmacy 9 is losing world of do I have to fly around to Z and they are absolutely blasting the bottom line and the first stage is survival in right now you can see the cloud nine it's just battling to be able to survive putting so much effort into it topside 420 Fest performers of Cloud 9 has been Licorice and so far to stop playing look very very good or God's been incredibly lame dominant before that is a at least a point of 49% is not that carry that it will be later on and we supposed to have a different place I was in the bottom line the ability to take something like an is really try and come online before the tithe it gets to that Lake and carry unfortunately to tip a fan that is not the case with this Champion it still is a create user who needs to be able to feel. VCS advantages Hussein members be able to do it well so far but so far in this game it looks like sneaky has been struggling this is looking a little bit more promising as we look for a bomb official site and Jose is going to take some damage will stop getting burned out on that side make a sound of someone is supposed to force out of plane was so close to hitting to Z as well just to the millimeter how far he could get away but it's right down again coming in from spin being able to push that in their advantage. It's a pretty big deal. I thought it was risky business and he did have to also there to access support for Spencer and he was looking around just behind the tower they finally get some gold back and it was he did stay and picked up most of the XP on that way but he will still lose almost the entire full next wave it is not a canon meaning it's easy to push in silver has an advantage of sub who's he will be more like vice versa as a chef come through I'm you fly around the mess of rest of the map and it's actually Cloud 9 members it is starting to generate a little bit of that event we noted on the analyst test how much RG right now seem to be focusing on that bottom Lane that were able to secure the pics that they wanted to know if it's very early picks Vol 2 Z and me in this drop at licorice Jensen you feel that they have stopped talking to rise to the occasion they are this game is tied in the early game and that's not what it was like for C9 last time these teams met I do want to talk with you tomorrow cuz he's the most important player on this refuse going pickaxe first two rays that will be less early-game power for him better scaling overall by skipping the storm razor Esparza has snuck into this Russian the top play next. Just looking for an opportunity to try and get let me hit or miss girl just barely Miss important slice really prefer to not gay but if you're beyond that slowly and I might have to burst a killing his heart's a pretty high-level has some damage their Yahoo fighting for war to get pushed back by Jensen just themselves + 14 CS in the mid lane not that show who needs to win Lane of course but it is good for density has too much Farm the most PSN the game has been having a great game Safari but also a great day earlier in the day his performance was a really big part of why climbing Rabil to get that win over Genji I just think it was kind of Highland and how he has a place you didn't have the best play in stage 4 lot of this split supportive midline into the city playing around, but today we kind of soil Revitalize Jensen the Assassin play as it could really take his pee much further in the world championship was willing to pick things the lactic acid in like the Aralia in the play and stay put the Rhythm just wasn't that he was never able to find you through Crown feeds give him couple of little braids you have to be good again in this lady face is starting to feel good Vantage and I have the casa until very late gave you another Cinderella is how I will put it kind of look at what options are is Casa looking for
don't be able to watch them almost more importantly Genji did not look good yesterday they got absolutely steamrolled by vitality and the echo play Ivor right already again and kind of sit up here around the bottom Wayne ruler and Luke are both so important to their teams in our city KY set it off the table not late game Cari Champion with y'all know the best in the world and that's what he played yesterday otherwise stash baazar, to fix rule has been using a water used to ask yesterday although he was my first little one for him but I need to see if it's as I approached becoming an inspection with airbag on a truck already fan of your sidebecause you can trade pics back and forth is orangey saying we don't want to wait to Kerry from Top the Forgotten a truck they're gone and then she get rid of two of those heavily has a purpose for bottling with the Kaiser alexco be to someone and I really like this angle from R&D in their band face you'll be late is notorious for his playoffs and World buff and Galant buff and he definitely is a top laner who can see what are the champions to the hard carry potential Farrah dusseau the Diana we did expect this is very common for 6:05 the kind of presenting opportunity for the opponent to split up the lovers Duo breakup get the record for themselves and force them into a squishier but very quick are all in engage campea the right away the Scion get the grass here we know that is a flex between top and mid lane go wait to see where that goes down who certainly a huge Champion school for him and ask flute monster on RNG when it's not it's him carrying when it is going to be at 4 to take the backin science would fit the bill for The Weepies on top and jungle I want to forget it support of Midland of a crown to play with the Camille and greatest Superstore to me to scrimmage rhymes with shuttle from winning slot length too hard when I have to wait until the second face and I also wanted in the Attic air Precision Tire and interesting right now because the G2 game is so fresh and everyone's memory where do they use the Camille still effectively with Wonder Swift would think but I really do like Harley Camille jungle how quickly he can go for a lot of control early getting those gains off I really think Lulu camil is a combination you can do crowns syndrome was not great yesterday in The Gauntlet he was successful running a lot ofChino Hills Eat24 Patty made an exact to style you looking for with him or we going to have to wait and see what exercise to walk into the mirror and muscle built in Santa Fe items have a surprise though neither easy nor able there other 80 Carrey has played it all throughout the summer break in desire because felt you like illegal to block one blade color feathers but it does seem a little weird to me immediately. I don't think it was the root part I'm pretty sure it doesn't I could be wrong I don't know that well but it doesn't seem to me that they know they want to do that will work well here I trust about my matchupsI like it really a fan here especially cuz you expecting to fly become Atlanta and then the guy who can lock the kids and we've already seen a Rollie and now be super super scary houses available available in Ultimate rides ultimate available for themselves and Constance chu chu train right down the middle from Zion they can Sports engagement Force flashes and then use their follow speeds to chase people down where is Genji they do have explosive gel Chase opportunity for with the Olaf locked in that is deadly to be a stowaway and Camille has really dominate that the top side of the map love Lulu against rise and listen around the Midland Bagels to loulas in that Skirmish and shut downbest rice place in the world and he will be able to move to a side length of light constant pressure of clothes he's just going to be interesting game to watch. Looks very focused around ruler flu limited for it's a lot of extra flap their the brown for the Frontline the only real big damn it said to Camille and not as threatening as a team fighter as a damage dealers are the ruler getting a lot of the pressure here on the team and certainly an incredibly top-class bottle in a ruler is super super incredible probably the biggest carry on the team I'm excited to see what he can do stuff against the best spot cleaner in the world and Megaforce and a star in his own right as well definitely all true statements here for a freak in the opener3/3 as well for Carson lease in this mid jungle to be to that you're talking about has so much potential the mobility of least in is very good in the Oval Office and have them one of you want straight up that will go to Owosso you really do have to get more creative and choose your opportunities there use the execution damage and make sure you actually finish off the kill I'm here Wego picks and Bans are done the lamps are secured and Royal never give up a 1-0 start Two Worlds the pre-tournament favorites going up against the defending world champion their second game of Worlds 2018 Genji was upset Yesterday by Europe's team Vitality but they can make a statement here today by taking down orange and we are out of the rim very very true if you lose the Korean. 1 and 4 I've never seen them have such a bad start to a tournament me why aren't you can make sure that China's State undefeated so far here in the group stage and it would be Genji fall in Korea one-in-four in their home country some irony that would be in for the home crowd but they will hope to keep their fans excited here for this one and look for a little bit of a semi on Vader when he was rushed with me for maybe a a trick board to come down or someone over stop slightly I like the trends that we're seeing the more teams willing to go for these level ones trying to get that advantage to open up the game we really big cascading effects throughout the early game so far nothing is happening in terms of inmates my kid would basically be bats level 1 champions in the entire game you can see Carson immediately respect backs off are they do scare his ghost for off that will put it on cool down so he won't have any more security and they drop off of work in the Raptor pit for getting a little antsy come down from Crown but Ming started with a sweeper and could get rid of that he wanted to help police then invade and indeed that will happen to 10 gold given over and compared with it would be done this one is how I was going to have himself a quick lube start so low as it typically isn't part of the same the top 7 the Red Bluff at the wrestler Camp contact would be looking to try and play towards the bottom side early with no Civic push is very strong an issue at the moment you walk down into the main page you're able to quickly take care of the first you melee menu definitely a rushing a little bit into the work they're does get the push for Uzi and then kills going out as well Guardian pretty standard therefore for JJ does black Elizabeth ship damaged well bit late actually Crown getting some nights glitter lamp is through the minion wave good base damage on her she can take a lot of these quick trade against a lot of mid laners for the main focus is still going to be playing with your junker in the early thing when it comes to miss exactly it's so much about the to be to around that midlantic drive faster route to set up moving fairly quick connect with Target but also the polymorph into an old run-down very very fresh and interesting he has of 13-track junglers in Korea the lowest jungle proximity was just time spent near his teammates in the first 15 minutes despite the fact that he puts out the least Gangsta sickly highest kills in assistant 15 per game of all the jungles in Korea when he gangster it works every time efficient fall off the time spent definitely not very high but the effectiveness is definitely there mean while all the other side car stuff he is running this dark Harvest which is gained a lot of momentum sister changes to electrocute for like a man that he should take it but there is a huge difference dark Harvest you have to stack up before you get your 100 50 Cent first hit only last 20 seconds after the last one that you just picked up Sophie was thinking that they're going to have a similar electrocute burst damage in early game and no skirmishes you don't really have to make it very quick after killing a jungle camp or picking one up there from a cannon in or someone died I can actually get that value otherwise you're going into combat without o'shoes part of why people use to take things like electric you on those type of Champions clear because it was Water by Gingy did the to Camp Red Bluff Crossing then he walked down to the wrist Guard rescue at that one just killed from swatting flies to post on us all focused on farming just wait for his food before we start doing anything we should know he might be at akademi Walter play the famous saying of let me always trying to just neutralize Tulane he's on the tank or we saw with wonders why you do not necessarily destroy sign in the early game get the two items and you will be such a massive threat in the timeline is that is the main goal for Camille is gold in the early game trying to build up your item once you start to get your GM at Bill your Trinity Force bill so you have first-hand that you have a always pushing on the waif then you get way more options you can take advantage of the Champions kit Camille with one of the longest engage ranges of any champion in League of Legends with your hook. Off the Wall towards a champion and X-Type ultimatum that start open up those opportunities one thing that does the price of it looking at this game is how much are India's pushing we'd only have to drink it for the village of their squads and have so far been able to not be touched by Harvey get to Harvard doesn't make a whole lot Steve do spend his time Bali that can do both average bottling ganker for lck standards and a spot I was texting to being so far though nothing much happening and if they would be safe in his bottom line it was coming untouched importance low there from crown on tooth shall who keeping his distance he's hiding this ride so that the roofers and doesn't go off what's that thing land that's where the least income it's all anime gets a big Bank around me like that he plays very well allowing animal off to take advantage of his very quick clear and how our farm truck scam on the bottom side now for how he's already level 5 concept was waiting for his Camp to respond that's why he looks about Midland but he is going to be pretty far behind an experience and we already mentioned that level 640 live with the Ludacris and run-down Shack if you win Midland Indians use that to go Portland and stop route from Free Willy soon now which is it that you just pushing the lame all the time he already is mostly a difference between the 280 calories but we know that the midline is still the focus so far so good for R&G they were able to do well on the bottom side of first overall the farm is quite nice on the Genji side with 500 gold ahead in the jungle being a very big part of that one 1/4 for now fighting the top titles with a channel not quite The Knockout do if you by not going to continue this fight as let me be able to do just fine on that prayed and camps to get little tapes on his own side don't have that she's smarter than men was looking around that Mainland to the queue there are two core JJ don't know if that small little visibility actually extend the horror of the name is pushing now could be that play but look how big is playing up you can jump back Tuesday make sure you stay safe just W's backward there's no way to stop that guy from getting out there no problem there and how it will have an unsuccessful get to the bottling rare pretty impressive and they're laying but it's not just the offensive play and they've been it's an ICS get that she has to leave for themselves into few already with their silver counterfeit but then also the defensive play their effortlessly almost debating and there's got to be a millionaire I just want to get out in 2 minutes just that all they just barely didn't have the extra damage do finish off the kill even with your Spotify pink eye from farts stupid gets out notice energy and how quickly to execute the combo cost at job said plastic holder from a sign that he was so much less DC right now see if you're not getting knockout from the Q and Q in Magic getting Raves near the wall he gets out in favor of Summoners in that trailer for JJ lost his summer nikhil of course it was ruler who brought TP to keep his face a little bit nicer to make sure those recalls weren't bad if it was going to take a long walk back here and it's not a cannon way which means he's been is Will's I rapidly men cannot reason for the pressure on him and it will be a lot of it has lost a lot for a movie that is very thick by Staying Alive top and getting the flash from Casa and then you're supposed to Fast Park Lane as well that was just so what's their him getting out because as I mentioned before the extra burst damage actually is there for cars that you finish off the red button before the 22nd dark Harvest actually fired he got there but
Kobe and officio thank you very much Dash and RSD in the analyst we are in the Champions to collect already and two games before Cloud 9 food Raven bands out against Nikki Heaton Vitality had an incredibly that they taking down Genji from North America reminder to get to make you picking it up again before I'm laying here by removing Adderley typically when it comes to Laney want to fight for their bands are taking David trying to remove some of that play making one through one potential to my channel to use successfully with their previous game the early irelia Banda forth with Echo last time but very soon in this traffic as well go with specially with is Raven band already off the board they're very much focused on the bottom Lane and you know I tell and Jack Frost might have good matchup for the boys definitely that's not a secret anymore cuz I'm a little surprised by Cloud Nine I think they were very successful in town if they can with lysandra in the play in stage and sang Hey you don't take the girl we can get priority elsewhere but they chose to go for a very stand-up in here and they left that Sia go to the Vitality that we saw from seen on yesterday against the highest pacifically destroys others that was definitely a problem for peaky yesterday is the matchup we talked to Z and R & D absolutely destroy Cloud 9 a lot through the bottom Lane they're opting in to do a similar set up this time around ready for round two if learned after day 1 to 50 I do I just want to see for telling your so I can if not but tell if you will take it and it really fits that place. They can do on record here if they want to and have like insane amount of a gape would really suit that play style and that's the thing you always like to have a 1 to engage with Ricardo 101 just have explosive and gave but if we need some sort of Frontline with me as well work on very frequently do very quick with the flash body slams ultimate so often. Definitely open 14 vitality and I wonder why they scared wilstein I have a calendar page for the wreck on seeing if they didn't take it themselves like it did yesterday I told me to get the confirmation in 20 more than I like it he likes to refresh a lot I always feel like it's very mixed results on it personally I've only played a back handspring as well I would have taken the rakan but maybe they're scared of a kind of thing and we have seen some good rest place so far at World this year but we have also seen as demonstrated by Jack on the analyst desk how very easy reaction time to thrash and interested more hanky-panky an overall so if you get into the head be head heads up and they both go in and out longer and you can feed Nautilus to a world so far could be a very good sport here and I was wondering Wednesday night with crab tank for themselves licorice more of a carry Top flavor but still has Play-Doh sword games with Jen games with Uno games poppy 31st I need a front line when they've gotten themselves that made in the jungle for Spencer and expecting a squishy for Jensen as well but will be out here just come through a different driver what are the slowest champions in the entire game and it's not a good primary engage because of that back so they're going to look for something else because they already have really good follow-up you know to Leah can put the map with the wall again about a creative uses you sit there and try to can follow but they might need something else as far as the initiation goes I think going on and then lock picking for you okay would be pretty smart if you've seen on a different things save me last week from it is very good against a guy on the Echo and I can definitely say that he can bring the pics as well he plays a lot of different styles of Champions by SIA band don't smoke it like an orange coming in and then you have pretty good and Gates on c95 getting banned Away by the time I get to spend coming through here the orang as you're mentioning of course a big one as well and has that albeit long-range engaged and Stucky liquid has most played of the split by man play the top winner from them here and waiting for their Midland counter pick out a dent then by the go what do they want well liquor is really has been such a big star for cloud nine this year ever since joining The Rocker learning rookie of the split that split-second in top wave boats there honestly even on text Papi play his or inflate have both been very strong so it's really going to be about how can the team actually bring it all together because getting their state of the counter picks for Fort Bend my pillow block been thrown down the gauntlet is there and tell playing so couple shop is one of the players he Prides himself on being able to play like everything I need to do to lose to the professional scene way before puneet did it I need like to try and go for counterpick but I I never feel like a super successful for Vitality when they play heaven to watch the top by like you always preferred on a tank I think Jonathan is that you find Middle Ground here you do have a pic while you can just play around it for you also can bring some value for 445 Anson engage tool so I think their job in is acceptable but the order on the side of t954 Metallica I'll Gallie I might be coming alongside rest a divers-down maybe it's hard diving Keepers benign a lot of engaged to play around Spencer and sneak is the primary damage that is the biggest difference between yesterday surrounding sneaky with tons of bodyguard lots of bowel control Supply plasma through the enemy team allow him options to escape into fights or dive in and move forward I think that the competition they can easily play defensively or off at the meanwhile Vitality with the LeBlanc in the mid lane that should always have priority over galio and it's going to be about which one is mid day in the jungle looks like it was the Jarvan that will say jungle in the top in here for, try to post one of his most played actually is ready at 4 stop playing in Kik is going to the Red Bluff in two level two gang some of that he has done versus North American teams in the past on different team or with the bus to Jarvan lowering the cool down on Marshall Cadence the passive a percentage damage Auto it's clear that actually significantly quicker as well we definitely have a conversation from Vitality way they can. A lot of place even in the early game all the lanes can actually apply pressure have CC setup for Jungle to play a round it's not as easy with your long-range engage that yesterday but that's a lot of playmaking alright let's see what happens if that's what it's going to be exciting one year up North America is always a treat to watch it Worlds by tality off to a great start they took down the defending world champion in their debut about 9:40 p.m. if I chipped have not nearly as good of a results as Uzi and Cole walked all over them yesterday but now it's time for maybe some veggies that a C9 hear this group does feel a bit wide open if I tell if they can make it out and we'll see if they can battle Vitality while here with the Predator Jarvan very excited to see if possible positioning here around early Wards goes as well as it looks like they're moving up into the fresh not going to be threatening to much as far as the invade how was your day Spanish lamp over and snuck his way in behind this could be bad for sneak if he shows himself all right now is Asos tracking jactroll they know where that price is going to know which way he's walking up for this side of the map so sneakers going to walk backwards and not much risk there is no one was too greedy on their movements and C9 was kind of profit season. If there is no one else 29 waiting and if we just ended up walking away they did leave a war behind on the Cloud 9 blue buff as well so Vitality will retain some information off of that invade they sending tickets over to the Red Bluff to start that one out by himself and I'll just continue through the Jungle Red to Leah Spence Karen starting on topside in my route through and it's already tells us a bit about the bottom line Focus they didn't stay to give a super good leash to kick his ass if you wanted to join seen on Insta me when the wave arrive so you can't get that first push for level 2 and when you're drafting is thresh pick instead of something I can work on you're definitely saying we want more focus on Delaney face everyone I should look for some pics around Jetro he is the kind of support release a lot of himself and he wants to be a huge playmaker but it's actually the most inconsistent support we have because he will be 1000 time it's also weird thinking that the option of not taking Arora Khan with his Daya is the option for more play making considered the extra range in the explosive engage that you can get with that champion but it doesn't feel like Northwest you know he has more options can Lantern Inn and maybe a cyst kick it up a little bit more in coming to that lane so maybe I want to have more participants in the bottom land party and I want to see what those parties going to look like it was going to get down there with you have somewhere to teleport in for Jensen in the middle and of course galio himself good at showing up once I was it comes around and watch a game face up against you say on this LeBlanc you can be very very scary has the ignite really good place to Progressive alongside that driving jungle how does early Lane face is going to go because so often and we've even seen Jensen himself in the reverse of this match of Alma LeBlanc absolutely punish players for early picking the galley up getting a lane Advantage pushing them in being able to roam first and accrue ACS benefit for the team what is the zuka going to be able to pull off here against Jensen I don't think too much because of Aftershock on the Galileo and TP like it's the super defensive set up on the gallery of hair should be very hard for us to get to actually get the kill as long as chance I can practice Aftershock obviously and that's kind of a thing if you look at the calendar pick here and if you look at the inside, it's really not about chance of being the big cares about licorice being the big Carrie Underwood on either you mentioned listen draft already it's all about sneaky like you want to make sure sneaky becomes to Pitcairn the late game I think early to bridge to what it is going to be the Thalia pick and what I like to see is often like to Leah with things like Alice. In this case it's an old was if you land on your roster what you are going to get pulled too and you can then land and knock back from it so then you can throw someone down really quickly yeah that was definitely more risky than as not to be for the hours for in Glick you may be a Gal Gadot aunt catches on someone and you can get the Yeezy size mix of but I definitely agree with you to Leah plus crowd control setup does spell a lot of early game first damage and some possibilities here for Spence Karen I know he's the one that has been starting since we got the group stages for cloud nine now back on the world stage and they're going with them or veteran of their jungler off yet for the course he played the last half of the best-of-five even qualify as a gamete took c92 all five games gabba play the first two was okay and then spend came in a kind of took care of business right the way through went to him on that score line and I certainly seen again putting a lot of at that face back in their old line of a kind of interesting how similar their lineup now at this point it looks to Spring split where they had all these roster shuffles back and forth 9. players Reddit for C9 throughout the split and now they're back to the same 4 + basil that they played throughout the rest of the spring I just kind of find it interesting they found of congealed back to that same roster and now you're back at work or motivated motivated that was the thing I mean we actually just have to give so much price thereto C9 Organization for The Scouting work they did and how did you like this huge trust because there are some of these names here that you didn't expect to see in the lineup if you go back a year like licorice office in the top Lane if it has been a great addition down in support of these are players that they didn't have to go out and like blow out the budget to guess cuz they actually got them from their own Academy team in to the main roster and that's exactly what that system is intended for me and while on the other side kick it was such a huge pick up for Vitality as well you guys can't stop telling me about how they were at 11 and one since picking up the new Jungle ER is absolutely a great story even Vitality new life and it has shown up here in world I mean they come out game number huge upset takedown Genji Go up 1-0 in the group and and really this was even still with a lot of the rumors around screams coming through not so hot for Vitality yet they show up cute performances and they get the victory would they screwed up massively if they did that surprises on if they get a chance she but we kind of looked at that matches what state does one game where they're going to beat these guys get day one is the first time they faced each other they can surprise the results I can already tell you that I don't think I've ever heard anyone say they were strong spring team it's always like that a lot of fighting a lot of kills and then no one knows what's going to happen and that's kind of been to style a band playing in practice on stage and I like that I hate team to play Super aggressive and screams and then play Super passive on state I respect if I tell to take for the same style even if they will fight and they played a very very good mid and late game up against Genji X they now they're in the
to be able to roam and that's why candy versus rookie send it becomes the early game matchup to look at cuz she might as well keep up with the most rookie if you can do the same thing just one LPL an expectation sometimes there been some falters from their top team to your IG one with High Hopes here as a first bands come through or I guess I lost a lot of engaged to Lowes br40 rock baby dropping so that volatility I know style out for taxes if I still have a soft spot for losing your want to see that does come through these very strong and again Jackie loves most played going to be one to watch will for sure I don't think you need to early pick those especially with her the current way that the teams are approaching take band phase boxes of course the the hot topic one of them already being banned at 4what does pose a question are you willing to purchase ticket for that trade with the support Champions like we're confident out there is already bad why is it up even more it's very very useful against then also the Kaiser which is kind of expensive has already been quite a lot but it is early but Lane straight away we want scaly but you're actually for G rex look very good to me the Vera Center Kaiser suit give Stitch a lot of power in controlling the way that this Lane goes and I I really like what they do with what you guys said about you know trying to win the Portland what's your nose don't happen once they've won the Portland the best supported actually snowballinghe can sit in Midland and you already have pork chop plate fault that he can go anywhere he wants and you can just continue to pray for the end of Mesquite down really telling me it's all about their piece of the jigsaw puzzle if they are really into your ex last game on Aurelia head rookie ready to accept flex but I'm here to believe in half and it really feel like more of a the chili pic then it is a dude perfect but for baby to try to get against Bill Fitts the puzzle of how do you equip exactlyGary so you can come down and then go Park Lane Osterville I just want to see everything so far is Premier League you know I want to see a really was Olaf in the Middle Lane little bit more and that was the only response to that was Alessandra band but she good in to Lovelock but regardless it is BeBe rexha's turn out of take their pick and they're going to go ahead and make another swordthe sign we've seen it from another one is Elena Smith in Maple of course of treatment centers on right obviously but they will wait to take the flash wolves it's because Mabel can use it to Rome but Lane I get a lot of really control 14 you can do exactly the same here with the forest and Tompkins pics of your ex might just take that page from flash. This really works for early can snowball and sign with Terry and is very late game scaling jungler and Zakir now to do I have a good attempt at an upset here they had a very strong plan performance and coming into this one with the least amount of confidence alright well still flexible Champions with the risewe are really there for Invicta spent the last pick will be syndra into the middle Lane for Druids by on topside to The Boondocks is so line up their Champions the way they want to go it's really does look more of a scaling composite you for ID but player so good they can still win Lenny face here g-rex this will be a tough test for them or you'll either test their hardest test of the group for now Natick later I just think bar for T-Rex like I like to see if they can have I'm just looking at Midland specifically especially if it is going to be the last game and who wins super heavily in. Once she completed a lot of pressure on you you're the best in the world and you cannot die a big part of it is landing enough backwards done here on irelia when she comes in with the DASH diet allowing her one of those Gap closers means a huge differencethe first image that you can actually get off summer spells are going to play a decent part as well expect to keep its of one here out of candy I think the jungle match it might also maybe stay the hand a little bit here off of going to have more skills put no one out by Soul off 45 and that could be a big difference here baby coming in his first game of World on the team played most of the games throughout regular-season petastic jungle mechanically he can be aggressive in your to get money needs to be here we go to first game of the World Championship for IG and a person Mainstay sheer for G Rex autocorrect we go and it is time to see who can do it better this time for nowhad a smashing of a game earlier Group D they made out quickly they could make work of their opponents I jump into battle for that top spot here and they wanted her to do so they're going to see if I can do so or turn things around we've had so many upsets so quickly in the world and coming out of this Champion Select I'm very curious as to the level ones because especially in exact Olaf matchup getting any sort of invade down here to get the information can really allow the team with the Olaf to have a high pressure early game you can really eliminate a lot of the possibilities that doc wants to go for it is a little bit scary for them with the promo codes on the other side you don't want to face check ride in 3 minutes looks like direction is Fanning out completed as a ward in the river to watch the Drake but that's about it since of ghost portal activation as well behind their own Red Bluff to see for possible invade so it looks like there isn't going to be even any sort of scouting going on and this is going to be ablestart off on his own red with a nice pool from the bottom Lane fridge already talked about you know Zach scaling on his side all up early game if we get past here looking with Zak here I love it I can take my time Killing Spree could when you jump in and Tom confess to take this guy next wave you can literally just pulled the time comes with you and into your own heart into play the defensive support against exact Nigeria's get fog of War on their favor and either side of the team lease so baby is going to have a completely blind jungle start early jungle fresh or stale any pressure for a rental in first they have the pressure and they should be able to keep black Jackie love and Valentine under through it if it was a bright like Jackie Levin violin actually taking back control of a little bit of pushing out the minion wave here and trying to get Stitch and koala a little bit back to buy open up some territory for Zack to work with he's gone to Red Bluff santacruz immediately roads are so so nice in the current state of the gameFirst Act to pick up set c a o e magic damage and Craig's are no the most loaded golden experience Camp I've never heard you this is all right it's well it's the best thing that is the best thing about Dexter League a kill ich rugs as early as possible to get to the reset so you can kill them again possible start barely a camp behind again favor here who is doing pretty well the old enough to be expected the bot Lane not plus or minus anything's the fact that ice is holding it against there is already a great sign for Jack of all trades on the side of ice PDF of fallen and and Jack love Landon some damage done to stitch and kind of forcing to be a little more passive and not just permit for schlade early and that's meant that we don't get directions early level to enter I'm fully out just laying here early on at least Uber pool clear will recall to get his food very soon and then we might get the first tank or he said you know what I don't even eat thatnice but other than that one can't believe that all I've got this is not much better looking for GF actually got some more information in sings back on that sell do crab 2 in the only thing stopping him right now from going in for the blue one is the rookie on the irelia because he saw his acting to have it yet he knows it's still up and it's exactly what you need to do pressure the sack early on low-level but you can see the rookie protecting his jungler trying to force him back one thing to note is Nick did you might and that was seen what he wants the jungle cat but there's no chance and see which is Target's whenever a jungle monster does switch targets more of the patient and that was the last little thick of patients he had that's what I call a rookie mistakesuch as life and 30 seconds left for Nick baby sees everything as a ward on him is now back on the map with fruits level for all us first gang here will mean a lot 14 that normally needs to win the early game to succeed and not famous people that like a macro inside of your ex's Wedding March winner lie detector game are really super famous fireworks early on he does have the option of going Bottom for the Scuttle and rerouting through this bottom of his own jungle side so we can continue to his power Farm Olaf also know can we are very quickly and should be able to keep the threat of his credit or boots around mid lane and keep rookie at Bay a little bit really is a protein that level six so you have to start thinking the second mindedly little bit when you're ready not only to 121 potential exact is around the corner and you go for a gank against her you can turn around so quickly special gets a champion like will look when he's diving into rookie but I'm going to tell us where there is Gangster up early but side with Rachel Altman on Sunday in present perfect kind of wonderful 6 on bars and pubs Lane with a sign it's hard to get frozen off again to rage champ like rice I don't feel too late for him to go to work and was so many people here congregating around the mid lane we can caution against irelia level six but stingy as well birthday image should be respected when you are so poor up there or a jongleur going towards mid lane when Midland Arts has just hit Level 6 is one of the scariest time because went in those Scooby Doo's or 383 situation and focus on himself the first cute koala in not going to go for the damage to a pretty easy walk away from the first day comes in stop pushing them back a little bit just get to do a whole lot there to can't stop siphoning to grab after he recalls of if you want to get level 6 back and then we can actually see a really cool thing to watch the time cancel a T-Rex controlling bottom side with the push as mentioned in taking band face also Vision are we still meeting with the first floor and I'm also looking at an infernal Drake on the map right now with Olaf and pushing bottomlands that's definitely a possibility even if they don't go for kills here getting close one down there nice turn around and actually there was a Flash and about not going to just one but it's a bit of alone time infertile he's taking away the Red Bluff right now though they may is going to be on the mini map and are just pushing some damage on to the bottom. I think it's always the argument between and then recall for a nice reset if your Stitch with about 1,300 gold or go for early Drake to Jackalope and bottle and can return to Lane and you don't have to be a secure and get ready so I think I just wanted to call his what's best for our late early recall get my cartilage level 604 play let me tell you some help on Dragon early on either they could with the vision that they have I know maybe allocate that but could it kill time before Powerline will show up I guess that's probably the one that's it no that is the question they decided to answer taking the safe route here they still have so much defense setup through here as far as 6410 that read book jungle for the bottom side top red side level six. Exactly level lead and steel need to be safe and that is rated but still that level he finally won a super effective baby is not finding any early success berkadia to hold his
some of the North American LCS for 2018 the winner is heading to World's End of play in Misty you can do it as a tax advance come through I am so excited for this Champion Select actually because file. Are once again this is the kind of been their recipe they start out with Jensen and blabber and can make adjustments depending on how well do individual player for forms and they already showed vs. Team Liquid that they don't have to keep us together they're willing to mix them up vs. steel do I specify that is too bad though it was Kindred band every single game that blobber was in when they started from CFM that remains Bruce Julian also followed up this the same way to start out before when facing Jensen and blabber Target that combination at those two players have become famous or in all the regions across the world have been very good but Cloud 9 are change thisReggie from the previous best of 5 in game 1 in semi-finals it was three jungle bands playing at Forrest Gregg down he's still got gragas still had a decent game this time Cloud 9 putting the pressure on Jensen irelia and a collie the most commonly played as fast as the midline are off the table this time at no Bronco available as well in Project the type of composition that they're going to run very very high chance of brig on a tank Missy on a tank and hauntzer on a tank if it's not GP GP has other than that it has always been on some sort of a playmaker Gallia also can't do that and then spend on one of those High DPS Auto attackers for the late game Bears is going to be that plus the song Lady face and of course we has been going to verus instead offind a little bit interesting guys had been much more frequent pick for him in the postseason is now she got twice the place on kaip does embarrassed but but you're not around there will be a tomcat for the keep him alive and see if they're going to keep going with us a very steady state has been being a great team fighter a leader Championship I really do like it specifically when they already showed early Camille Camille eyes are very very high potency for picking people are very long-range but she's super squishy if she commits to someone you tahm kench devour that person all the sudden Camille will usually find themselves in a bad spot if they're not paired with something like a zillion or something that's going to give them some sort of defensive but on the other side here by 9 let's go with is a sock yeah because I'm very glad the North American teams have increased their priority on this HR associate in the LPL beforehand and never really even dropped it down and across the road as well for stronglessons from the topside and licorice going to steal that one of her from from positive but he might have to say it in a fun what I really like this I think they're worth 0 pics or bands of a truck in the entire playoff bracket quarters semis finals third-place 0hx expand at all they can watch the LPL LMFAO the region of the shows back up in the regional qualifier got a very similar scenario where he's very big across Asia to see that we have seen or got mid as well I don't expect this from you tonight but the TV in 2 HRS fixed but still want to watch are both bikes pics eight thoughts and our God can be moved to either solo Lane but he talks probably a higher percentage there for the topside forgot definitely very versatile Galliano band does come out because Camille's already been picked up by cloud nine that is one of the best combinations in the game you have Camille guaranteed and gave and locking people in a an area forhow big are we stunt with a ride and you can see if I'm still engaged could run you think he's losing another support from his pool as tahm kench was pick Ramen Leona where band is going to play something else all right so yeah they're they're definitely willing down on a couple of the support roll pics here for is basil big playmaker 459 no coming in out of the academy League very early on in he was one to stick on the starting roster.switch down here probably spirits and now could definitely haven't seen a Oriana jungle as well might hold five friend not going to bring that on at Nell's Cafe CT time soon alright meanwhile though the big locking of the time earlier if they have three tanks and they've already got them here Tompkin forgot and Scion hear from the topside for Hunter repeatable engagements for the late game when you get a little bit of cooldown reduction and you rank up your ultimate gets almost a 30 seconds there you can just buy off Opie after altice to get those heart engagement respect your head absolutely and we're going to see what they were against here and Cassiopeia being covered and Jensen going to play Cassiopeia intothis one and that one also had a first level 100 the greatest of samples Cassiopeia kids safer in the mid lane also has the rain to bandage over or got which is very big for the mid lane but again jungle or presence means so much in this and if Cloud 9 are going to have blabber on his Camille which has been so aggressive on and has played around Midland Camille and Zach ertz with the longest range engagement for junglers and both of them perfectly built to Camp around the midline so this is going to be a very interesting matchup between Justin and fierce than both of those guys are extremely Star Hill mid laners was very high skill cap going to want to get them ahead this is not the first time he's brought out or got in the NLCS postseason I think back to older guy around 2015 where he took down Cloud 9I'm at be out in the sun if they got to Serena outside and that was exciting as well either way we are in the game what is best of aggressive player with that Camille but Zack still in the pool for Greg and the only real range Marksman on that TSM lineup is spent damage dealer here. More to play but a very exciting drop all the same yeah I mean we were projecting at least three tanks for TSM account forgot as a tank so they've got basically for it's going to be up to his bed to have that big damage percentage the analyst test mention he at world has had the highest damage percentage for a team in any single run of any beer at world yetWorld Cloud 9 final stage of the North American Gauntlet fight it out here Cloud 9 I've had such a miraculous run at the end of summer they want to make account here and convert speaking of damage they have damage from basically every role of addition we have on our hands here and look like a very one-sided game here because they have so many options for damaged and in the early game if you will win the scrimmage is across the map because guess I won't be able to group up with their with their big damage and it's not even just offered Evans office for diving as well you think eight. Can revive Camille can drop aggro Alice returns back to be Invincible they're pretty good it really press the advantage those guys going to be in because that is so far for this Cloud 9 composition I would expect a lot of focus on blabber and blabbers early route here you know either give him a strong pull on the Redbox take over boat. Krabs in the river Camille absolutely will destroy Zach even though Zack after you get some levels you know can have a good presence around mid lane with elastic slingshot early on Camille has a huge priority over him with the hook shot and she will be able to dictate this early game so it's not the Cloud 9 to use blabber and know his aggressive playstyle here trying to help him out early here we go though it is going to be the double pole on the Red Bluff kind of Edwards expected what is a very common second Camp to go to now yes but for Matt Damon do his life is that correct a negative and high HP and help them if she actually Slaughters those camps so we'll need to go sport at that red comes down with rats. It's funny because it has evolved to be Zach's favorite can't because the magic is that you mention that used to love going outside to do the rough as well as a profit the same I'm there because Chris is so valuable now and he actually destroyed them with his family this is definitely me to Route and it was very good War there by licorice make its way to the top side as well so Cloud9 get to be informed of the Jungle pathing of Greg to know his right side Jingles totally open and Weber can use that take whatever Camp Seawatch I expect him to get a lead in the early information different keep your head up. I want to see what he's able to take away from break us not to Simply both scuttled and we need to also look at it from tsm's perspective right they pick this back into the Camille knowing that they're going to need Vision to protect zacherle off whenever you have this scaling jungle difference you know that your laners are also going to have to have that in mind we're not going to have to play your lane accordingly nephew could see it in all those words in the river defensively 40 at them they know blabber is now going for the second schedule if he uses all his abilities on this guy then you can go for the in Gable ends coming up yes is why I'm going to be in front of truck attack you back for it but yet be available to know. I've been able to match in camps and great move there by Missy it's all about the support from your team when you're going for these jungle permit is Zach is able to steal that one away by blabber slips Into the Blue Book any fish yet before the wolves are finished he's got a mouse with while it seems pretty likely so as if it's still in the way he's got to sign the report from Mobly that's worth from refrigerator TSM for yesterday and he actually looks pretty Siri coming in today he said that the team Styx most of their problems coming from Oakland and I think now found their stride what I love to see was that he told his players guys if you don't have confidence trusted me because I'm confident in you back to you guys are you sure in words from Reaper do you don't have your own confidence just trust in me and he talked about them fish fixing some of the problems from Oakland we have already seen a difference in champ select right here sneaky right on the Kaiser so reliable late-game scale know doesn't have to play like a Quinn has to go to early leave play side Lanes to join you know get picked off then and won't be able to put out teamfight damage later on caixa definitely very capable of that well also be why the Champions that can infect which side lengths later on because of an ultimate is one of the reasons he played twins to my supposed to go to the play some Matt mobility in those Quinn games against Tia said it was something got to be pretty powerful throughout the season but also the other Champion that they got locked Kristen for was the twitch I looked it up in summer of 2018 which has not won a single game in any professional region only been played three times. Sorry we did see her lyrics to have an eventual Camp lead over his supposed to jump a very small a quite sizable Advantage for has been admitted on the bottom side so different size than you expect a truck CDL Lane Bowling there is kind of the same always be ahead of teleport though also dented actually gets one level four no kill shelters in the end have to blow their flashes Greek as well and fairly early stages in the game so I would expect blabber to try and play aggressively following this get them division right now while you force them off of the map and Zack you do in base right now you can see already the clown on Vision on top side is starting to creep in around that Red Bluff would expect them to make an offense to move up here by burnout taking over the Scuttle feeling very confident now as far as the classes have been blown junk down there you mention that teleport was brought on sneaky hear that TV is going to use them as both a tiers get back to Lena to still a Farley proof topside Define level six. I just mean just as I could be there by the city of nowhere to go first in the Midway for Pearson after all the shenanigans that we just saw with everyone blowing flashes in the conversion around Midland he actually use the teleport bottom it's something that you do need to be aware of her Cloud I can just
select DSM make a much faster Dave it here today Cloud Nine kind of the same as to get us something to pick them bands kenderton zillion still off the table flower in Jensen's Bill starting course they did when does an alarm for Metrum Cloud Nine with one good engagement put them up 100 in the series to get them here today again turn off the table for blabber very big play making a very big curly presents I Feel Like A Champion with a somewhat limited champion pool with four pics with for fix as well his next most played with more than one is not for everything else is what is a one-off and probably not very successful smell a truck also takefree much always had Greg on a paint jungler but I like to keep blabber primarily on these damaged threat so that he can have to go to the Skirmish digitality invade with laners that are. Or early on in the game that has been banned out against them a lot as well as been the heck room which they didn't actually find its Mark and then he just had to scale up what's tinder holds first and Akron doesn't have a lot of fun if you don't get your another look at baby white Eames brand is so much against them with another attempted it stand for sure going to be setting on a watch for how we can do in this one has not played any Graves all year with different picks up and I was your night going for it here the heck room on the table saira Khan TSM this is obviously an amazing 241what can I do to gain with these hands Duo it's very strong but my eyes will be on because he has been good on Comcast you know the Chantix August once in awhile there but those are much more tasty Champion for the support role then work on is lightning quick engagement abilities actually pick a fight for the team but he also has to worry about his exit past and we have seen the teeth get blown up Steam games that she has done so that it's going to be a point Focus passenger that one feels like the most obviously killings work on right away goes in use both him and you'll at least 141 yeah that would have seen that be very effective as far as midlane team fight counter to work on a good licorice was on the eighth Rock in the devicein the side lane however he was very big for 5:19 winning so many of their skirmishes creating a lot of those openings for them and of course the game winning Pick on Timothy so that's an important takeaway that CSM are grabbing for Haunter yeah I think he's actually been really incredible licorice Amadeus Rock concert band to the list but still up could be one for Greg of course his overall available when I get rid of here so I don't have first dibs I don't expect them to place the split in certainly a champion. Why do people always want to see if you're a champion that has the ability to make big plays for the team I know whether it isworld champion with them big l e c t we saw him one of the players of the game is just last week with a galley I was not going to be the case this time around his dentist takes it away and that is kind of forfeiting Lane priority and you're saying okay you know if you want you can run like a try to roam around and kill people but I am going to be a big presents for the team and have the ability to set up if there's ever mentioning and you're looking for as far as their tanks reading the possible early dueling you feel good against Callie was well who runs After Shock can you answer back they have to be after going to go over to TSN now as well so I think they have an insane back line here Casa Fiesta I think the engage is not bad leprechaun just can die for it now if I was going to find out if we're giving you no likegetting to team compositions PSA test went from a 127 very quickly because not only do they have shredding Cloud 9 in Champions but again they always used for kills ants but I would actually give a shout out to older players I've been watching the founder of kind of logic gaming with very adamant that midlane Nocturne was very good five years ago because you can instantly clear the minion wave if your Q&A Autoplay doctor I have The High Ground but you still exciting for the Top Lane matchups is going to take it into the phone I can't say that I know the HR sacrum a chip at all never seen it ourselves cemento in dodging out of the queue sweet spots and then you can also get a little knock back on the atrox himself is very good at setting up for your junglers whenever I see a cop you would gravitate towards that and it's all a few games so I can for him because he 36 nice actually a huge damage definitely is a secular Leon both those matchups in fact the entire top side of the map of the self-healing camping but it's definitely does have value no spell berserk roktavor to hear anotherbut this will be a very exciting game we are in a game 2 of the series everybody Cloud 9 took down to you soon 3-2 in the semifinals she is a very much want revenge here or over the first time in world history PSM will not make it to that world stage Cloud I could be the one to end that run twice in the same split or I like that licorice is actually running the phase Rush year bought a head rub instead of no very common predator for them to make big plays for the rest of the team and maybe room mid phase Rush it's actually good for your lane because you can convert so much blue speed into damaged where do you get your keys to dodge one of the cute sweet spots and engage on the Xbox to proc your face rash with your Auto and Q Plus and then you have sustained movespeed the Dodge the follow-up once from hrf it's going to be very micro intensive match up here I'll be very curious to see them actually play Alpha Lane phase when they do go for thestrange cuz it depends a lot on licorice using his speed to dodge while Hunter is going to try and correct for it with his uncle dashes and if you don't land something like the second or third cues on him and have him can know make a bad a cosplayer look very silly but again jungle match up their does play so heavily into these two top laners a mess up my plan of the Mid-Atlantic fit as well be rich enough for snow nativist Kate's can certainly be hard cc'd split that is a ludicrously large Champion Full House play Cassiopeia till now I've got first time last one as wellis one of the longest-standing players in the North American LCS has been good on so many different things that so many different times and even though he's under a lot of criticism 20s and losses do people put them on a champion that they don't like he is Joe to be very good on all of them at some time now I can't be comfortable with that we just all right there licorice using is corrupting potion in the queue spam to trade with answer within the lane cuz if you to you don't have to take minion aggro yeah just push him off you can apply your crafting potion burn and Hunter had to see control of the minion Waverly between those times delivered to the very large window to get Circle shoes off and get a lot of trading and you can see now this Landing pushed in and we'll try for that first Recall come throughto the reactivation of the cues from a fox cuz you can have very big Windows where the threat is gone since you'll be able to put the wave does get the rundown Grace a little bit of information here to Cloud 9 as far as Greek positioning on top sides for sure but again. Both Scuttle shuttle for themselves so early double Scuttle control with all the vision that goes with it really nice for them. However just slightly in the gold lead so far we look at the various camps and farms and it's much closer is Nikki and basil Sulphur okay on that really can't despite the fact that I just got picked up to be called little for coming through for blabber Craig and if you want to go backwith the first major plays in this game is so far it's at the farming base to the top side seat at the full Fleer where you do quick second and then kind of reversed down to the bottom trying to farm up get that level 64 Nocturne as quickly as possible but Rick is already on to the invite because they didn't see Nocturne you can kind of deduce that he went from a red up to croak side Greg over award I think they know he placed it though so they may be aware that there could be a class maybe didn't see him actually play Syd Cloud 9 or going to reveal themselves Greg on the opposite side do you want on to break show me wanted to be a replay of licorice going down to the triplex to splice a towards butt he's got a bell bottom side are able to get one back for themselves and kind of re-established amor Al fruit for the team as Pops I was just demolished and I wanted to reply here we go licorice they didn't have vision of him walking down but he was walking up there so maybe a little bit of communication as far as they could have possibly been a ward place but look at this God and know something is up with licorice is positioning like that great though easy for the focus and down and on spendel there's no more possible Escape so very good by blabber you just flashes over retains the fear tether Denson Trump duck from the mid lane you can see fjords and still in Midland Farmer in the minion has galio came up to claim the extra skill and that was a big swing for cloud nine topside communication on the fact that he was coming up because you going to run for the wall walking into the galley of good plant gets a Flash Thompson uncoordinated play from KIIS FM on the top side not quite accounting for the movement of Cloud 9 you don't always have to have the perfect vision of the enemy's game but read a little bit into the positioning that they're going for and see if they're giving away anything I hit it and it's hell as far as which side they're hovering meanwhile the doctor every single time is Champion is pick every single cancer talks about this guy needs to snowball this guy needs a curly so he can use his old kills level 6 on doctor now don't have paranoia available and there are flashes across before that are possible to punish this is not level 6 yet and then they got the kill on bottom side for GSM used his Flash and look at that up there 7.8 to 78 Ford with a how much fresh to the atrox had in that size biggest steak in a white thank you very much that's been putting them in up there and this one around its cyclical level of pressure and Cloud 9 when people were talking about how scared they were of the scenes from strands a big reason cited was that they can run anything at a high level and this swap of a heck run which even surprising in The Jungle Book actually just to take you a liar and swap it topside into a good matchup into the atrox here and being able to have licorice play quite well bladder not going for in a bag don't let me tell her keeping a trundle safe because the old right now with such a powerful tool yeah with a lot of TSM liners not having flashes and he does kind of waste that one but we'll see what the pause is about in a second and right now it's been talking with the rest maybe it's on him and it wasn't about the jungle is fighting but I got to wait to see speculation to be later either why so late
series the regional qualifier has been a 308 230 into about to be a 308 out here if possible happen Kobe and these teams have been playing very close I would take it. Letra series have been a 2-0 where is the other ones felt like Stomps on a big TSM are within their right to make it back here goldenglue in this out of this is their time to pull out all of the stops they have have to make it happen here or there season end the first that would be gets emptied an endingearly today never have this much time on their hands as the evolved irelia up and available back to to Jungle Band towards Greg I want to see if they said you wanting us a fun fact about great getting engaged I agree session has been Champion I want to be picked up in the first phase because there is no gas to help with the hard dive another new compound C9 side really good band from adjusting to what cloud 9 have been doing even though they are leaving up another option for bladder price lacks on his way and Camille I think the protection is something that is more important there are not a lot of options for protecting divers as much as there are options for divers themselveswell we're Conga music. Zion seems likely you can wait on that pic of course I can go a little bit later aatrox the champion has looked good but it's been both games despite Blanco size that matchup but I am again. What year I didn't grab that are leaving up they can grab some more their diversion none of that Galia these offenses pics but I'm curious to see what will be there galio replacement what will be their binding of defense for these divers if they match up that he just had with HaunterI really expect to see is that I am here because I think she does work very well in those diving beans Delta kite things like there are champions I can work that aren't I have it that's the pic here we expect HR stop playing as you mentioned before the draft is still a flexible Champion but I expect he is sent to pick a jungle in mid next phase but I will probably be banned in response to that I need a mid laner and a flexible top done with on the mid lane or if they continue to whittle down on possible jungle Champion pools to force it into a more often. Wayne and that's actually what it looks like it's going to be they want to force it. Once again not going to wait is getting rid of a C9 diabox Davy make him forced to more conventional situation but of course I do so much damage that might be hard yeah I meanplay more options the Camille is another one obviously that was very successful for pliable flapper first time around but there's your Aralia not going to be on the table this time around 4. I really am curious what comes through so many just curious what face threatening, for the other team would consider is domestic Camille 242 Kobe beautiful stuff on this one will ever again be like Grey's but that is 3 a back road on Waze off the table and gave him and I grew on figure he's off that would leave the option if however trundle has been the target of some nerves recently and they started to whittle away at his power we've seen a lot of teams be okay with that trades and not quite so scared of the interaction where sidhwani with her passive as last night's early on and then once you use your Aftershock as well you basically pecan stats if the timing is correct and you use your ultimate for a 220 will then drop down very far is a negative resistance is in a liar team is better be not going for more conventional to cancel Universal Champion 250R on but it's not the same as what galio does and are going to go for a Hoveround the trundle as well what kind of texture are we looking for is benign side and then again that Hector is flexible it's happening every possible they could fly a viable option to go for Tilly and the jungle hecarim States top I do believe all right this is going to be very very snowball here to Leah still has so much even though he was at the very beginning of her peak in the jungle roll are they taking a lot of cool down pretty much down on her take it down is it as explosive and it does take a couple of levels for deleted to get back to her previous power-wise route to set you up that would be one of the things I'd be looking at the other thing is bottom line is a very big possibility was basil back on Alistar okay career playing a mage the backside will be can play the team fights well or I coming back in for beardson and it began a giant Frontline if you want to consider ergot melee and rakan Bailey than its again for Freightliner is a desire and it is not often stated when it comes from the jungle roll useful in pulling off power dive in corralling enemy jungle as far as the wall that you can create with it to make people get hit by the head from Ultimate or make people be on the wrong side of your rise realm War ultimate for themselves to use to be interesting to see if they can combine those things like the rise and filia ultimate to pull off those place cuz that's what you like to see in professional play take it to another level through those creative use of facilities and finds aggressive plays again but it's not the same kind of diabetes in for Saint Cloud Nine to give us a new look to see if they want to complete that sweep or if he isn't can reverse their fortunes and win 3 straight we are on this could be the last North American LCS game of 2018 csm's Back Against The Wall we are back on the wrist now Cloud Nine with three people who were rookies this year to make their way back towards world now what an incredible journey for these guys working still hard in the academy leaves Cloud 9 putting more Focus than almost any other team on the academy roster and it paid off so big for them this year they've needed them the most they were able to dig from their Academy team and find success in the LCS as well Cloud 9 has been I would say North America's most successful organization in global competition they have only failed to make top 8 Once back in 2015 but 2013 14 16 17 they all made out of groups or Auto qualified CNN have been a good show at world it would 701 play in the last time and if they wouldn't hear their back to play in the world 2018 this year has not been they won Academy playoffs they won Academy World physically and they made it to the finals in the ALCS meanwhile do DSM they have to win now they need all of their fans behind them their season 2 has been so Rocky all culminates in this point they need to win back-to-back-to-back reverse sweep if they want to keep it going Red Sox going to go down towards the cross the different food now for Greg is going for more a weak base klear got the Raptors in his sights is Gary Sanchez has been made and so far for him perfect PS not much of a surprise for knocking at the door. Vincent with the same honor Heroes they're going to push back and forth unspoiled in the top side but he was last seen flying to decompress as well Benton family. Both of them so they break takes over bottom Scuttle crab does walk over toward the blabber should know that top Scuttle will be his option will be open was finished up with the Raptors first we can head up there after is pushing in on the top side but liquor should be able to support him well enough to grab that scuttled before they get back over to the side of map that's the whole point of all these early River Wards every single game both teams play multiple words in the River ski the first trans we're getting down to the shuttle so that they don't get CC but if no one's coming around him at all so for cancer peace now for the dog loose then because top said he can try to fight a truck that's why it's it looks for those cruggs up their remember ignite is the Summoner sell for hectogram he's going in now so you know it could be some damage response or can I get the push to look good for if you find that you can be dangerous and just barely besides McDonald's and it is a long cool down but had a charge available this job there by answered not having to use any Dumber spell truly on the early stages of a match point game are so text her we want to be the first one to make a mistake we going on here immediately pops p e r us back cuz I don't wanna be part of this one a couple CS but break his back out of an app available resources for why you wants to take stool many potion and go inspiration secondary is both of the health regen but also in large part with the biscuits and corrupting potion replacing your man if he can spam York you usually for a gangster or counter and he's going to go at off of recalls talk to me is to teleport back to Lane going to just use a key for the Speed Charge trying to get back there to Hunter and climbing PS4 right now with licorice David heliport for a possible crossmap play now pushing back over and I pay only about three CS with lots of fun that Rico want to lose out on this PS4 factor that lane you're exposed to an enemy jungle repeat gang choose between bad situations are EPK or losing out on some CVS licorice does not play the 3D games but that means that haunts her now has the big wave looked up go CPS Workshop payments again battling a little bit away from the heck is there he is actually Power of Positive vs. Sophia Greek in this video I'm not quite sure what the communication was like if he thought that gray could join a bit sooner because if Greg would also commit someone can get over and apply that would be enough sense to know what the heck run has not Lain with flash she's got her tight so it is possible go for those early all Lanes but because there's no extra support the Chris gets away with it since deactivation and we talked about how much the same as got in biscuits corrupting potion and he said he'll back up a small portion that probably be extra, get graviton that really recall that damage wasn't knocked out getaway dying at the tower allows Hunter to level up is opened a time it out out and he had them out to Better Health now looks like it's not going to be a diaper happens lyrics to no taking it right to him make I keep on your toes there for some running around to your screen door in southeast he hasn't been a huge player in the of but they do know that this is where the play is going to be made these are on the Alistar headed back to Lansing pretty quickly there you be a top psychic
we CTL going 4-1 3-1 style of game twitch can really throw a wrench in the gears for that being able to show up in stealth assassinate people in those side lengths given get really really tough with the early when you're in a rough do we do against the rain support and now is Olaf in early aggressive jungler who is he really tough your 49er pobelter Olaf you for a highly prized Wrangler get through the wash as we Rise Against Cloud9 throughout play artist we've heard a lot of stories about their strength from camping bid with a ghost coming through with a lot of Earlhas been able to snowball those out of control and we're getting the switch have changed in the jungle to help hair grow make a comeback or the addition of the extra Mana regeneration from your Talisman through the river is one of the most the jugglers that's why a lot of time they had a very slow start however that and a couple of the extra movement Talent have been very big and bringing him back and he really wants to see what kind of a bill he's going for here as well if he wants to run straight into a try 4th and goal that really aggressive style for if he's going to be playing something more like a center hole CDR I think I might want to be a little bit more tanky just considering he is the only one that will be building51 I demand a little bit morealright sticky on the twins. This is the first which we have had all split and the last time it was picked was in week 4 of Spring by Arrow but see if he can bring it out here to 6:10and if the real question here to be a cow sneaky and Angel are going to be able to do in this to be to match up it's against the Morgana it's against is a with a flea for work and that it's going to be tough for this lethal Tempo twitch just arrived I think it's very important that we're seeing an early invade here because I said I from is one of the most romantic and kinds of jugglers security is very important for this Champion you need to get your first clear off on Heckler I'm so that you can go back and buy the boots to use predator for your first game it's very critical the first 3 minutes for blabber and that's why they're trying to defend what team liquid got a lot of good information there with the invade the clever going to be starting red with the leash are we can see Jensen is going to be going inspirational secondary for the time warp tonic likely for biscuits here as well be able to sustain Peru NE Fridley pressure that the rise can put on because the early levels can be fairly tough for malzahar in these matchups but once you get a couple levels once you get my lost after going you really can wait there almostI look like my brain is going to go over to the crows to your so much more golden experience in this small camp after the jungle adjustment that might mean that we'll have some sort of Confrontation over the Scuttle crab but Olaf likes to get low for the extra attack speed in his jungle and will be able to secure the rest of his blue quadrant and Team Liquid should know the jungle pathing of Labrador there is a ward book over there after they knew he started for bread because the leash from Gangplank and they were where they haven't got a rapid just yet that camp is still there so he's going to jump the camp entirely but I think I'd go get some more Mana for himself isn't going to go for either Scuttle so Smith you can see on the mini-map is already trying to take over top Scuttle where is bladder is going to be on the bottom side and we'll see if it dueling protein liquid was Secure the bottom level 14 liquid to get both of them and secure the vision yeah it looks like they're going to be able to do it they have already grabbed that's a really nicely done your from TL in the early levels using aMorgana Kaiser pushing in we're going to remove the resistance is from a Scuttle for an easy kill on the bottom side able to push up double lift in Oley with priority in the bottom Lane Work lyrics on the Olaf going very efficiently not much distance traveled between his camps and he'll be able to end on plug on the bottom side of head again want to mention that TL dueling grabbing extra camp on top of that one so certainly is stronger clear the Raptors still waiting to be taken on that cloud 9 release him held up in a little bit won't find the sun though and she look at able to reset off this once you have that possibility then the mid laner also have to worry so pobelter on the rise might need some extra vision for himselfand you can see I'm playing towards the bottom side of that lane a little bit because he has more Ward coverage down there they have a Scuttle is well want to protect himself from any potential gains that would come in from the topside and you know the barber will be going through those Raptors first or anyting else ice pick up there's Bolton knocks down a couple of little boys as well as they are not too heavily hurt in this Lane should be able to get himself to his email outfits laying on the table to double list self and take him down Smith is going for the first gang cure bladder is close behind though so they had to be careful about diving proof liquid answer was watching but the cue hits anyways basil flashing directly on top of double is unable to get out and once you get connected with that stun you are going down there by sneaky and Zazzle what are the rookies for Cloud 9 coming up with the big play meanwhile on the top side to do a veteran impact and Smithy or able to take down licorice licorice though he did have the money or the time he died that is an important power specs the matchups is going to feel a lot better with the ques band has gone klepto now as far as part of the reason you have more money is there but maybe the durability would win a different when I can't came through I'm going to be okay also impact shooter's name on the tank very good CS for himself early on vs. licorice on the on the Gangplank ER but it looks like Midland might be the area that thought I want to focus on neck because the malzahar has hit the all-important level six steps to his ultimate try to hold rise and place for the heck of to run through so I wasn't worth mentioning that the infernal to be a big ticket item here especially for C9 because they're running such a heavy damage composition would really get a lot of the extra a D in AP and blabber down on the bottom side fears of Autumn Lane can't get a kill or push up a potential girlfriend but right now they're going to have me out farmed about three to four camps behind its level 6 to level 5 has not yet found a way to see what himself in this game qvar good damage was pretty close as well very close to that was Lance a double can also get off another Auto attack to practice plasma and a huge chunk of damage 50 head down to the bottom side though to S west of Health in the vision for 4 SS in Oley the first blood was also big year for sneaky because it allows him to get there early Vamps after as well as the boots size that makes on those findings and also likes killing through any potential post there from the Morgana so a lot of that to his advantage that steel drafted for is now gone I wish you would happens though as if I've had a goalie for Team Liquid meets an overall laning phase victory that is jungle in Top Lane mostly we're now five 9 or without summers in the bottom layer going for the topside get a spot out Jen's been that way does a rabbit live outside blabber out of him pack his back to safety pretty fast but not quick enough to catch in front of the ultimate here and in fact that was very close but he gets out alive baby blabber is going to have to be careful as in Smithy is ahead in that farm he is level sick. Could be looking for a fight without ghost or whatever. liquid are able to get one back for themselves but this one be a kill infernal Drake as you stated earlier will be a huge fry there to be one kill by The Binding in the all-in is completed used stuff now for TLC rental Drake that was going to feel good as 9cs lead he can recall for everybody wants to as way to get stubs in really important for their that's what you always mention getting those deep rewards into the enemy jungle flabber heading down on the heck of over that wore that they can see him now at his Rob and give up that gang we have gotten some answers now blabber going to work as his first item is not going to be able to look into style triforces really aggressive bills but here it is one more time on the bottom side work on it in the brush out of vision hear from sneaky in find the perfect opportunity splashed all finding Point Blank just perfectly done from LA to pick up conversation has also been around the bottom playing Duo working with Olay their communication issues how to split but they have definitely been working together very well in recent history and it just goes to show right there even though they got first blooded they're able to pull off the play out of it has he done they're taking stock respimat piddling basically equal a quicksilver sash rushed in for both or he's not going to be that all this game we do something have the ultimate available for a bladder tack room as well as gangsta for I meant nothing to him down do you think it is a really intelligent purchase therefore pobelter though it's not going to be under any sort of solo kill pressure should have the freedom now on rides to be able to shove a Lane Bryant look for a realm or place to help out the bottom Lane DL heard it in SS MVP speech that the team looks a lot of faith in him to put the resources in him they're happy to play around him. Love has been there all star absolutely get the key the league and we'll see. Press come down that's really worth noting to that it is the klepto as you pointed out earlier on the GP we're so used to seeing brass now you're not really a custom seen that thang like if you do get a lot more gold so despite the fact that he's going to be getting a lot from that klepto and we'll get to that Triforce at a pretty fast clip be ready for those who fights already we're seeing 50 work with pobelter rotate to the river with his jungle predator on the rise old laptop that can find me but no roof know what he says he wants to transfer stays alive nicely traded back and forth their Jensen does have to lose for the elite if you could look to attack in nice finding go here from Olay workout has been one of olay's longest Champion that we have known him on finding some very good binding fear and on this big stage and as you can see doublelist I see pretty good stats for him as well this summer average reigning Champion is something about 421 5.7 kts it's either going to rise that score throughout this game 1200 Golden Tee looking out the top way I'm expecting to see if mostly just kind of utility Paladin's you're coming out of impact he's not building more for the ones you want I don't expect to see anything like it nice Warren I getting that righteous Glory early on it just going to increase his ability to Rolling creases ability to look for those engages we had to do was go with the rise of the glacial augment Scion when you completed the right before you would also latest Cloverfield on the grout afterwards but this time around you stack the extra help with the grass another rotation here through pobelter and Smithy to have it cleared out the vision in the river though so glad I should be
every time he has been put back on the bench or traded to another team but he persevered you put in the hard work he went he grinded so Love Hewitt even went to Korea to Grantsville if he's there all his hard work has paid off this year on cloud nine and it's such an incredibly important match the most important of his career by far and you have to think already down one game if you drop a second it's so hard to come back against the team with this much experience and it makes it a really really important ones when I already Team Liquid with too fancy or Target at Spence Karen we saw five utilize the grave very effectively last weekend and I was going to join the Kindred on the list of Jungle Band dropping their zillion banned from gave one to do so otherwise this draft is be exact same as in Dearborn down track has the first pick and I see no reason for Team Liquid to switch their strategies Paisa extremely good in the legame doublelift is an expert on the champion we saw it last timeultimate well he's able to DPS Stowell Barkman players does and you can give it to that Gangplank your for C9 they did not really dominate your against the Scion in game one and they don't have to worry is it just going to be the Morgana again more focused on the try to get the TV to Advantage Property out there on the right side that showed that intentionally they're not showing either so alone or yet utilize their counter right side ear is elastic a solo laner to of the counter picks for it so that there aren't more options for teens liquid to go in and they just go back to Rob once again that was such a good setup for that they were able to go invisible and get the first blood on double lift with a jump through and basil Landing is donewell I do agree to try to look for half the counter pick on that sign the Scion I think is such a ridiculously consistent later there's not really a lot of pics I can't dominate here there are some that can kind of scale off of him and look for those liturgy messages but are you willing to risk it all on something like a Fiora who could take over in that one if you want I'm not sure that they are and now that they've showed up I was a hard that's not a surprise but a big do anything as well you don't really need to throw too many bands are so we'll see what the secret plan here for free food actually is pulling up it's just the syndra here as well as an old taking this one away from Smithy with allowed him that a lot of early present in the last game and it's good for the stuff to be about that we talked about it be about something that ReaperGolden Goose off that they feel that they can attack from the first game that he has shown us it's such a big event and we've seen a lot of things across the world use as substitute especially that jungle position exactly Identify some strategies what they've seen on the field from the enemy jungler and find adjusted at Smithy dominated last game completely constantly going for the invades and it might just be along those lines and there wasn't didn't work last night here for as they drop D is here been added Olaf to the list and there's the hover ondo their normal season game Squarespace Karen and gold include some of those killed best career on it for so many years World perform extremely well on this Champion North American final you wants to do it again and they definitely making some early changes in The Jungle Book very good combination irelia and says he has been used over and over again irelia Stacks up this done or said Juanita quickly that you can always threaten he's all into crowd control available to the duo he's insane if it is the or and I I kind of questions going to the red side.perhaps maybe even another Power pick on the blue side as they didn't really go for any link how to fix the blind pick their mid laner their last picking a tank I'm not saying this can't work but was the right side right about the Orange is something that has gotten Cloud 9 to where they are now a big part of their rise in the North American LCS summer split long-range ultimate from licorice they've shown him running towards the Midway try set up gate you'll for whatever made mine aren't they have it at the time or being able to start out those big T fight a great room for sneaky on the twitch the free fire alarms do say it even more focused on double if this time around here 4th PL while irelia certainly can a success in the team place in the late game it's a difficult for her to have a lot of the Bobby V so it's going to be about the tides for C9 you have to pick this recent me to have an effect in the early game to match what the money is going to be able to do later on because I'd make it all about SShe is there MVP player he is the All-Star fencing to be what's Cloud 9 will be targeting so he has to watch out I will Team Liquid keeping three of the same five Champions 597 two different players on this one even through fry some of those roles that mouth harp still in the middle and licorice off of damage Duty back onto a tank to play Team fight Team Liquid Frontline was far better in game one that set up double lift for a lot of success in the pivot for cloud nine puts a torn in front of sneaky switch to try to get the same here in game two hoping to type the series of Cloud 9 let's go to cells in the game 2before this early getting really going to have to watch this is business battle between Smitty between Spencer and and the rest of the squad sous vide certainly came out on top in that first game and feel was actually able to get both of the shuttle in those early moments and I think Tina is going to have to do one better this time around if they want to go to keep face and it's actually worth mentioning that the reason Team Liquid got both shuttles is a large part due to the bottom lampplay Matchbox the previous so that might just happen again here we'll see if that a patient's come in when you send of course can do some very good early dueling and had plenty of attacks to stock up if you need it but the bottom line is starting it off in a very similar fashion show more does Andy find his mark have you out play they're going to drink at work down not spotted by C9 and basil will not too too much I just kidding In this River I want to see what the options here for Spence Karen on this least in our this Champion is one of the most loved Champions and all of League of Legends because of the playmate ability that you have on these things I was going to have to watch where he places his trinket Wars and see if he wants to use those to pull off an early move around in Lane I'm going to knock down this road before. Much issue for the Dallas it burn and I'm going to take one more Auto after this is it goes down for trucks were pretty heady clear botlink wish to go to My Cloud 9 side as if we had LeBron the previous game and I think that's a really good Fallout will have to see what they are going to be if he's going to look up early or try to attack that mid-length really expect him to at least try to challenge or the scuttles on like we saw a Black River camp and again he runs this over heels so he gets a shield life feeling a little bit extra Spencer I know already out onto the field looking for impact impact has not yet level to get there right here look at the baby has it will tell her town too much time over to the Scuttle and that is a lot of early pressure there on Dan packet play on the big stage is able to take 1/2 of a small rose and get the regular split kill kind of feels so good but this time he knows at least in his on the top side from that early gang and he looked for it Nails the sonrisa que the Blazers than a kite are more than enough they made pobelter go and 8 in week 8 of the North American LCS but here it makes them start out with first blood for pobelter to Team Liquid in game 2 solo kill on a player that had been maligned by nerves so much this is his first time on a date this big I was so weak I might just shake you but we'll see what happens this time who's on here laying on his watch the Redskins matchup spotless hoping to go sequel toppling the summer and licorice not getting bullied nearly as hard to put out of course you dispense can talk about some of the ramifications of that kill as well pobelter did not use his Flash and killing goldenglue there did have to use his flash trying to get away so that does open up this pit Lane says wanting irelia like we talked about for a cup is his wife had took you to quickly get this done and as soon as those Capitol Building start coming through yet to be very careful and especially because they are also the expiry 6 if you can knock that pass it off to set it up as a heart is a team-based champion has a keep siding and Cloud 9 keep taking it feel for their team play in roaming around with credit if I fixed a hard time finding the word this time around all according to plan on the web wow just to take you can take it out thank you for it I've ever seen the top side though we have the real things going at it and this was a big issue in the last game the Scion packing up his grass constantly for this time around licorice with the help of Spence carrot note in the early gig is having a much better time here and he's on a tank of his own so once I get to the T V pill have a similar role loving Captain for 3 call come through for sticky picks up his own boots to dodge the dark Bon Iver. There a spot that word blocks level five on that and of course he knows better actually sent your volume yeah that barely missing may actually cause them to wait a little bit of time because he doesn't know that pobelter no 13th faded out a little bit you can cookies on the bottom side if you want it to be to kill you just want to be called Agro have to respect that and Aurelia they combine with his son to take down gold and blue once again and this is a 0-2 start for the subs very rough in a defense Karen also having his early game on this Leaf didn't do Chihuahuas he's not a head of this money at all Eddie's download Flashlight to have less play making when he gets sick are the games going incredibly would even with the oh Law Offices really nice with them some Farm pretty well for Seen On The Bus by little box that they fight against all right so keep liquid are planning this Counterattack Cloud9 what state what the Trap has been sit right here they just have to try and reacted get out only been able to do so good they might help her when they needed a boat and they really need to count on sneaky in the bottomlands there veteran with the squad to carry them through this early and now we're now in the Championships set here it is on this date you can not built off of some bad early gameplay in the details of that kill our personal this time or lake is missing flasher Morgana does it have it for a straight till next level more time will it does have a black shell toe feeling pretty confident that he's going to be able to live when he bought that stuff with you tonight the poison expunge all coming through this is again we saw the same combination you're from Cloud 9 Chico's invisible with which allows Azo a jump opportunity was waiting for that binding a jumped out of the way onto sneaky and allow them to pick up the kill is collapsing to this mid lane build his around that they could get cut off where it's at the game 18 liquid vision is the key near as they see them walk over and set this play up allow in the car for the road for the bottom leg goes plays around midlantic with so much about the vision as you said that Vision plate not catching the war by Midland setting up the TV to the response you're so quick to set up these played when they do the thing that is looking for them that's not for your glasses Kankakee engage watch that Midland flight once again is 50 sneak by the vision Smithy he's into Spanish perfume liquid doublelift had pushed Fairlane make it easy for them to the last on the Cloud 9 members of the plant is used at doublelift comes up with a gold after that one giant leap Leto 1100 goldleaf for Team Liquid defending NLCS Champions going for the back-to-back that look good tie the all-time any LPS Championship record of five titles for the best-of-five wind here today it looks like they are on face
who all play together before it was something out then for that starts now he won the Academy final Savella toast America competition out like most successful jungler in any way for Smoothie in the bottom land was traded off the team but now I'm number three must-win situation for cloud nine and Jensen's back in billion is back out they go for the switch three straight games he has a performing very well is playing with a doll that got killed on their own in the bottom light in both gave one and gave to what it felt like being started to fall across the map and these will never really haven't drove are losing control jackets are there never really able to get through that late game for the switchif they had been to worry about earlier in this series II out themselves willing to give away the wrong before going into it or are they just daring clouds are credible Frontline around until they had to get a job in ItalyI actually might like to go for Gangplank so ass just not had very good escaped with exactly put together a comp where you can pressure down the bottom line of the Ezra from can do that if you can pay for them yeah I definitely agree and also the opportunity again to bring in something like Lucid much easier to attack an ad as that jumper than it is a chi stuff has the ability to make a lot tougher to get those tickets at for double lift it made sneaky think of something longer early Lane face with the vale go for very strong quick phrase from afar or had the option to jump in with Rob if you call your jugular and you have 4 numbersonly uncomfort yet again here in this one is for Donna for back to his breasts getting banned earlier and wants it at this time around does seem like a crab the sign before the band face they will three straight so I can swear they've all been good so far they have been very very good at pull a in the semi-finals on his breast was really on point with each book after book after book is he now he's going to have to be careful about that I made it till afterwards if you at that is with both the threat of the actor Arrow as well as that of the fresh up a jump of her own safety there the lantern is very big and repositioning for the guys wear liquid mind for peeling the Cloud 9 giving those Scion away looks like mush Morton counter pictus trundle of course incredible against giant Frontline tanks and sticky we've been able to.your time is up time Garner band out here at Cloud 9 1 a whittled down on the office that's if he has to pick their roles in early early very strong open figure from Five Guys Who provide a lot of really pressure still a lot of people talking about how about there being able to neutralize midlane all them out of the car and you the bottom line has wind condition in a row but if they don't want to grab it they may want to take it away and it's not going to be either as a power farming jungler to let it would have been to the way all right what A Team Liquid going to take off the board Here solo laners still left for Cloud 9 and it is pause Lane Focus licorice so many games recently in these playoffs on the Oort Cloud 9 of relied on it for that long range there are other options do end the toppling we have any other region 16 obviously Joe got his very, but things like Greg se10 go as well now that you got taken away this rental and you also have the to Gatsby's that combo against one tank to use I always think is incredibly strong into you fight you would do so and then you can book them down with that Beast might want another think you member to go along with it and pray that play that Frontline because again not a lot of mobility and they really needed set up the battle advantageous situation for SS to be able to have a tough time dealing damn it. Just go back to something like that malzahar and Play 4 for in this game for something like an assassin what are the areas that scene I've had the advantage in that middling I don't know if that's a magic power off in the back straight into rides instead of I do more of a team spider will do what he wants to go for a heater core work pretty well in Princeville whittling down to Frontline as well as plenty of physical 40 play imagine he would have to keep in mind because it's such a crazy combination the room prison the body plan he's going to be surprised even through all the reworks that we've had with both of these is for both of us but again we have talked about the focus on killing Frontline here for the tea Nike composite is a trundle the Cassiopeia what are the best in the game at full thick down goes frontliners this will be a powerful 585 cam position but you also have to remember you put a Verizon the sidelines it could be really avoid that 5:00 e55bt final Champions collect of the NLCS 2018 season and knocking down Cloud 9 lineup d91 lying on Veterans skill and Instinct Spencer is Benson back together here alongside this year's rookies and basil and licorice Nikki hope it is not that we have not in the past Avery about to be starting this trophy on the line a trip to World on the line for cloud nine you know liquids going as number one number two to be decided here Oakland is ready we are players are as well as game 3 have to remember also those World implications hundred. He's going to be watching with bated breath if ye'll Wednesday also Auto qualify in with that second spot for North America alright Cloud died all of their hard work the entire summer with motivation issues changing rosters working together training comes down to this and liquid looking to defend their Championship only have known winning that's forming as a team and they want to keep the streak going dim look at one of the few super team that I've actually born fruit in League of Legends they grab impact on cloud nine going to win a championship with them obviously won worlds what years ago with SKT and is on his way back to World once again now on Team Liquid Xfinity arguably the most successful jugular in North American history with a win here gets for trophies the most of any jungler in North America I would move double its 25 tying him with barracks in for the most all-time in the NLCS SS also grabbing the MVP honors yesterday no checking those boxes to be in that conversation for the best player in North American history the only guy to do it on three different teams he is constantly had to prove himself kicked off of seal G1 with TSM kicked off of TSM one with Team Liquid as well next release for the garage at the ready to be taken scrubs for his first non buff camp how it works in trading here with the Axe by the way you fire off your volume to get your lethal Tempo products going with your very quick trades and burst of power as we all do you keep your distance to Autumn has been so good all the time about doublelift but Olay in the first game there with the Borgata flashing out of the garage getting there till back out with rash horsing Summoners and forcing Health trades with Cloud 9 is out of potions now he remember he is running teleport not the heels if you were to get caught by another flight another book you may see that flash forward and look for that first was that he wants to wait till they get TP Back Forty or he's not going to burn that until he has that 800 is gold Beauty foot up brace but it's going to be awhile effective Lane looking this bad you check in on the top side as well liquor has had a hard time fighting and even with the gang giving him over in game to not be able to be the stronger player so far then that looks with Baymont Smithy. Chase had his own jungle and even though he gets away alive Spence Karen get to claim the reward for me the Grump doing some counter jungling and you have to wonder if that is called flash what I do they look for the first Blood knowing that this is the elimination game and maybe playing a little bit you can't take a nap hospitals his to claim as well but the rest of his jungle for the first time it's 50 is actually behind the jungle matchup sending that TL I've been relying on in this series Best Western finally neutralizer player so far things looking pretty good in that midlane for gentleness Philly a big part of why that's going to be able to have that pressure is the fact of the Casio is pushing pobelter try to answer that but book after book diesel getting pushed out a likely going to see this you will have to go back to base year contract with you will get a nice little something for him take it back to land without too much of an issue here to yell going to match that recall yeah Missy something we bring up a lot with him to get his boys on stage is one of the most unsociable players it packed also Library cool Under Pressure there yet to tell her to get back what's 50 on this date even after going to counter jungle you can move to the opposite side of the map go get the counter grumpy and leave behind again Vision it's all about these Wards so many deep warts from a liquid that have led to the success in this series you started out very early working with both pobelter and Olay for it and now they once again have a big setup that has seen this movie in the works from Cloud 9 the Rubik's Azle up though they may want to look for flaky Rhonda pobelter remember pobelter not running Cleanse This Time Around so if you could get a bronze done onto me cuz he dropped it again he saw them come through their own jungle on the wards so they know that he should be playing defensively and should be playing to the topside away from that we'll see if they can actually make this happen and if I even go back around along with realizing that can't go through the line through the river will not find the game going to walk by of War himself we know spindle spend down here and nose is probably some words on him good. The time here since Karen all the trundle counter jungle to boast of the Raptor camping left the vision around of his own and be able to see Smithy so they can track Smithy they know he's going to the topside now and Cloud 9 can be a little bit safer 3 complete response Karen that is the biggest cloud out of had so far and it might be an early fresh out of the box when do teeth mylibertyconnection use his full teleport channel to get back to Lincoln earlier that was ATT disadvantage entirely but in fact it's nothing out of it to make a big play for the team they are but they have flash also and the numbers were kind of people eyes they're so they call it off Pizza me you'll see us there for the top lamp or liquor if she has a little bit of a lead so far I will be an ultimate ultimate at 6 as only hit 6 midi if they don't play making a with that group of players who try to attack a lot of off
you took that one and that's obviously a sign of very good things for them you talk a lot of European analyst g2r probably forth in the power rank the who's going to win World right behind that triumvirate so far and undefeated run is a good start from the Before Time in a row raining LEC Champions and yeah you've got more Dornan shed and they already banned out too so we'll see are they just going to actually triple van in and try to force impact off of that try to make him show something different and that is the case they're think in fact you've got nothing triple band on him and wonder is going to look to dominate we will see if in fact pain no rise to the challenge he has been known throughout his career stats on those kind of stepped up his Blake international events and he's going to have to be able to do that here today as Wonder with a smile on his face walking in the first pick Renekton with the three most play for impact already off the boardspell Alice at the world championship group stayed so far Volver going to be a champion that impact picked up for the role of hadn't played it up until two days ago Baisley Boulevard them to the answer the top link Canby play Jungle of course for Brock's Auto I'm still expecting of toppling will see now what else do you want to play most played so this is a flex pack and I mean if it does end up being in this is a completely reasonable matchup for in backseat going to have to wonder how much did you to accomplish with those first three bands know maybe they feel like it really is a huge drop off in performance for impact down on this volibear but we'll see if he can hold up in that matchup because we have seen a lot of players playing this match up and doing just fine on the vale but that being said he look right now is going to have to find engaged elsewhere right without the shed without the orangethe champions of people feel like paper over some of the weaknesses that team liquid has and I do think especially now with rocks on the grave there is a huge amount of pressure on cor-j day to be able to find a champion that can be the engage 14 liquid while also not getting blown out in Lane fight Nicki X and perks well talk about getting blown out and lay in a course that's a pretty strong leader good at pushing but not incredible all in Champion we were talking about the possibility of twitch coming back in the lineup when you're not against a raisin or being Ritz vegan cinnamon craving a lock-in regardless and one for each of these teams because roxa in gancos first played it for the first time all year yesterday the day before in the group stage Keene on fanatic and gancos hadn't play hits of 2016 on h2k brought back into their pool because she's so highI do think that the callista picked year is to help to an able to engage I talked about that's going to be necessary from corejj there are a lot of options you can go with alongside Calista Calista thrash I think it's the most obvious one is also a strong Champion record JJ if I'm G2 that is probably getting banned out how you also have the options of things like a clitoris can you have Alistar you have tarek as a combo Leona there a lot of options that really can't be enabled by this to lifted white even more aggressively Leona going to be the one concern coming out this far with Tom gets banned out you know that does make me feel like you're they may be looking toward the thrash but it'll be interesting to see if it actually makes it through Big Ben the address but that one as well also curious to see what comes through at the Midland match-up is one that very clearly both V2 in tlr trying to save her as late as possible he'll be in a red side means they get ultimate did on counter pick and let them go blind if it was going to work very well and if you saw those are the facts green graphic during countdown it's been kind of a rough road for TL so far if you can bounce back there was a syndrome that was very very likely she's been a premier pick at the worlds group stage so far in the mid length will see what he's going to play for himself in this month and I'm expecting them to save last pick for Jensen because that match up he's going to be so critical yes you do gain an advantage by picking for that bottom line as well you know they're going to go for something like more generically Oriana you could do that Alyssa another pic that you know that can work very well. I think his could go to Denson but it doesn't feel like his style of Champions so I am assuming this is the support for corejj I will say that supports that really not very popular in a General Lee statue he have some success with it but really across-the-board no one was playing it ever since it got some of those nurse a while back who is it is a more aggressive option looks like she was going to go with the J Schmitt so very early game Focus, pure they're looking to smack Lane use the Renekton to Jason Italy to push in to get priority enable yankles to get aggressive takeaway jungle camps ambroxol add more on that back foot and Oriana not a surprise here at all if it does get locked in for a chance and that is really his bread-and-butter Champion I would say this is this is a pretty reasonable well-rounded composition here for TL they are going to have I think some trouble in the early game if they are not very very careful. There's a good set-up you know both in bought and top for than Italy special sick the a hero's can be very deadly and Jace can look to get really really aggressive on to this Oriana in the early game so will be interesting to see where they get priority in and what bracha is going to try to play this game like because I do think Abraxas going to need to step up his play try to be more involved in these Lanes yes he has been spending time in a warning for protecting those lines but I think you either have to go more strongly two words of power forming a strong leader so I can carry fights or ganking more often so that he's having a more direct impact on those lines yeah I do want to see him to show up a lot more in the early game Yankee on the world stage has been a delight here as well as second Italy game since 2016 and he is the only magic damage on the roster look better on the team liquid we got for the first to see all games was that they had gotten too heavily out drafted both times this one at face value looks a lot more equal and we'll see if the actual then play of their 5 instead of against G2 who's obviously the European team I think in the history of League of Legends you can maybe put a nap if they're for fanatic with the 2011 World titles World final MSI Champion like you are the Deep Run out of the LEC Team Liquid here looking really good so far and taking down soon as you already said that game was absolutely incredible I hope that where you are in store for a competitive one here today I agree I do think that seals draft is it completely reasonable I think you know if you turn name plates off you know a lot of people be very very happy with that TL draft do does come down to the execution Penzeys players step up and match the level of play that is going to be shown here from the European Champions a lot of packing to be answered then North America if you look at the last one game they have 100% win rate in the world champion take it if you look at 80% VLT D2 and this is a match that is a a rematch of the fastest best-of-five any of us have probably ever seen the MSI 2019 championship team liquid took down raining World Championship g230 TL as fast as you can blink your eyes and now we get the rematch here at the world championship to close out their first round robin of this group here at World twenty20 Del Rio in a few days time that'll be exciting there as well but TLC get a chance to shake off all of the malleus people have thrown at the LCS off of the rough group stage start off of TL themselves mg2 in their most recent best-of-five and we'll see now in this one if they can shake this off until you let invades Italy Spotify Turks and he walks away so I will see if if Jensen is as well caps rexha going to move down but nice. Does land and I mean I don't know how heavily they want to commit I think it in a drawn-out fight it should go the way of TL but they're getting poked down and look like flash is first part 4 tactical and a red buffer Brock's clothes and the red buff together this might is landed there by broxah and G2 I think they had a much weaker level one but I think they were depending on the back that maybe tail with play that more slowly Landing boys you landed up Spears you post them down you win this might and maybe goes your way but this time it is TL starting out with an aggressive level one plan and it does work to their advantage tactical also gets the kill witches cute are we have seen him dominate on Calista before you his playoff performance on it one of the best one benign style kind of 80 karrie performances I have seen in a long time and we'll see if we can replicate that exact year against me to spam out of Mickey X in a little tooth comes in first for the TL side across portege has a splash as well to start things off very important point it is Phase Rush Alistair I'm not always a big fan of it you aren't durable until level six that means for every single time he will do to the core JJ tactical re-engaged and very well. He's outstanding player I actually have a lot of high hopes for the support match of the ALCS MVP off the back of Team Liquid regular-season win on summer split making apps I believe was a top-three All-Pro voting number three I believe on the All-Pro team and just incredible part of the lect2 championship lineup as well as I feel like you know for G-tube Mickey ex has been a game again soon and I believe it was was incredible so he he really has been stepping up to the plate and no corejj I think without a doubt that the best player in the ALCS in FaceTime last couple years he's been really really crushing it quite a bit back right no processed old is he is going to get that 3 bucks and because this weight is crashing so much later it's not as though it's an easy. I like if you were going to do this this Renekton dually dive on the ball of are you would want to try to stack the wave and do it when you have to level three against the level to level four. That being said impact aerobics yes that's it honestly wonder is created a very large Advantage up there by himself and that is not from Jungle pressure you know they knew the Yankees was step behind that is just straight up from out laying his appointment was the one to already are you have to say those three bands for the impact are paying some dividends Ford you too but it will say despite the toppling difference with definitely is there and props to Wonder Man by Lana looking at the liquid Jensen is upset with a bigger wave to farm exact same boat for cat litter on the bottom side is he's got the previous lead now pushing back broth so want to be like for today turn the flash to get away and that is rocks a little bit too far off in good fun that was very poorly played by Brock said he have full vision of Mickey walking up you can just smoke screen a man walk away you know instead he actually stayed try to get them David's down Mystic you that is unable to talk face rash to walk away so we actually have to force the flash out there so it take from Rasta you know that is going to to limit his progress if he can be highest farming very well but you know you have to be careful for looking for any plays about Flash for sure big chunk comes out of Wonder yankles now it's leaking around the brush there's a war though the lane closed nearly stopped vehicle and punch them down but it's going to fit through the EZ pick up there and Cutlass comes down for tactical no boots just yet for his side as we got them through the topside 14cs difference and I believe the top we will push toward welder exact it and it has it so it's going to slow push forward and that's why we walked for it and didn't get those minions allow them to stack up against a nice trade here at the back because he didn't want to be able to push this to anyone feel the pressure in Brockton do the cast is really low so that's why he's going for the baby's trying to steal with them pants to relieve pressure this is why I brought that has been criticized for is that you know when he is power farming he's power from his side of the map he didn't match up he's not going to his opponent's side has looked a lot better in the early minutes here no getting in the face of you and goes trying to relieve some of that pressure and we can be the G2 bottle and heading up towards that top side trying to look for a potential Rome play up here and it looks different now Jake Olson Team Liquid game he was holding the W in case you went in all of you to file didn't get hit by the Shockwave are from Jensen the easy Turn Around from for JJ the W across the whole Squad G2 everyone up to the topside spend a bunch of Summoners and loses a liquid are looking really good in the early minutes of this game right now the Savior a G2 is still wonder up in the top side Force teleport down with you can't show up the end of the other fights for a while but still doing it right oblique impact up the topside Rock in the jungle lead feel safe going to beat the red bumps like big but I make you a little while ago no problem with might got to be close to 6 and finally as have to go get to level six so it's okay I will finally be fine with corejj occasionally there's a reason to switch the champion if it's really interesting situation might as well be your selfie option obvious one don't get some support to get it but middling you got to say is going well for Jensen as you said you saw the staff analyst and having the world championship that you
a lot of wins the team seemed very happy now again it it feels so much it's right it's kind of backed up some of the problems that they have had in Spring where know at the end of spring-trap. Calling solution seems like it was for the first little bit of of the summer split and now hey they don't seem to really have the answers they are in a pretty heavy been trying some different things nothing is really working and I feel like this team really desperately needs to get some wins to build that confidence backup are losing the first time around a beat in the first round in the rematch is their losing games there wouldn't go for something is definitely going wrong cuz they were in first place at the end of week for that's no longer anywhere near where they are right now in fact with them earlier Wednesday up with Cloud 9 of the other teams above them to speakFarrakhan strong to hear it for a lost and smoothie this is the first non-ferrous game we have seen in the ALCS from Lost though it is worth mentioning as a coach I think our said last week hate we're going to pick verus for lost because he was a bit nervous and that is something that is going to give him conferences biggest Comfort pics oclg actually takes it away from him this time around and I think it's a strong picked individually and maybe even better by the fact they may be putting this guy off of his comfort him as well D Grace band the early pickup on the kitchen open pushing down a little bit before it can still be a top winner of course Bradenton going a lot of places but my money's still on it being dark so I totally agree and I think that because you're getting gamer trucks on your W-2 from the AP that you're building you can build more aggressively at the results at times I think it can be pretty powerful people always talk about displacement as one of the answers tohas Kendrick drop the ultimate Frank Askin all you out leasing to kick you out Jonica push you out those are champions that are considered very offensive drawing against it definitely agree it's we'll see if this can knock down candidates have definitely been a very strong Champions do for the nalc has to be rid of his first no sorry secrid Kindred game of the split personality join depression that again recently and now it's time to the second round picks and bans and look off the table not common champions in Poplar North America but these windows remove here I'll see if they're coming to goes away one final table and banter sealed boxes turn to pick right after that that would be a Jays player if matchup make sense I'm trying to think what is it that your son wants to play that he's worried about adjacent to Oslo even getting banned out here I mean I think makes some sense when you're looking for, The Knockout gragas with a knock up and cook you a middling could be going Top Lane so that it may be a bit of a read based on the pictures they've actually gone formaybe looking at Nar for something is the flight out of here Yahoo normally known as the counter to Nara thinking of like safe top of the dark song could play took his perennial or recover of course the option either way through the team will see what comes out alongside that those skills you must login a chance to win for rumble yet in LCS summer in the NLCS what is it played around the world and I don't play much more heavily and some of the other Regents play wlbk it elsewhere in the world can be very very strong and watch a match up so I think certainly should have the advantage here against the show gas but that being said to a certain point where you have so much Mr that in combination with your past that you can start a really just going to ignore the rumble and then I can start to look bad for them cuz walk is a guy and he has either you or run away actuallyLG with a ride compliment is one of the tanks spray back more effectively against Rumble because Rumble comes up the flame spitter you connect to be hitting them with kind of day are we on your vocal spikes and you know getting a lot of things so we'll see how who need pen play the out there much more squishy composition of Horicon presume kind of run here for Equifax but they are always more on the side of run higher damage compositions that are heart attacks you Don but have very high potential if you can hold them off at his death from Deca Fox style of play most played Fire Road Gangplank engraved for example of altomonte back on Spindrift his most played here as well and it is jungle gragas self echo-fox playing as you mentioned and aggressive line up a couplemeanwhile C LGA cho'gath and they send you feedback line alive and a rifle damage output pretty well-rounded hear Michael Phelps want to play Xbox loves the big fight around the map loves to try to go for a few aggressive diets in these sorts of things and Shane can be a strong answer to that Comcast when you think about somebody games have been played today Comcast standing behind a very strong against a minor marks been keeping him exceptionally safe this is going to be a very Earth without that sort of feel without that sort of state that they normally have still work on can be incredibly powerful in the engages there if you catch that fairest he may just die instantly statements going to be the name of the game for the echo Fox side clgi much more standard composition ryzen of himself not all that common anymore in North America in profly still is being some don't get me wronglast year we had seen before from him and we are on a summoner's rift here for this battle CLG just barely on the outside of plant position Echo fox jumps about a game and a half behind first-place and they can keep up with him liquored they can't I hundred thieves with the wind right here and it's another champion that does have that semi Global presence kind of answer fights around the map year for Magnavox if they want to go for this early skirmishes to interesting options here as far as that the matter is going to double cleanse were smoothie and Demonte and who the electric Andheri here on the road, and I think that is simply because he's up against the Shan someone who should have left lane presents and you driving that extra little bit of damage you have the Selfies you have the Eyrie this is a much more aggressive set up here from smoothies goony looking to have more Lane dominance with him this is not kouign-amann Guardian this is not coining and kind of more of us it back style build it so what we got here for ourselves right nowno face checked invades a host rent answer anyting worth also pointing out sticks day is going a crafting here as well right so this is the same thing that Cody sent did I he is, he's going to be going lethality I think this is really just saying hey I don't actually need the door inside of Mordor to go for that having the extra man is actually more effective and allows YouTuber have skip that Surly beer once again so I think they making a hundred these are likely screaming or that this is kind of popping up and in their circles as it's really the first time I've been seeing intro play this weekend as well right you'll and the E Crockett Bushnell at 7 to have damaged, lad mother 2040 something like that and he's got a little people down that way but for sure and not be biggest as far as follow up pokies going to be there for the all-in looks like overtime right now a pretty equal trade of farm these waves areI keep a favor for sealed you pushing so this is getting to first and you very rarely lose the potions I have a, not the case here and it does look like it The Relic fuel Charges going to be helping with that is looking much further ahead in the game when you think about poke it should be fairly because you ran for one more head pushing this way we never can go grab a Scuttle who needs to have to go to back to the base and use his TV also so super aggressive play here from CLD but it does reward them with a Scuttle a flash if you peeI want to see if I darshan can stay safe though because she is up and pee pee but he is down a flashing. Could come for return dang so or did he pee burn dies in only that refillable potion to look at the Middle Lane to Montefiore pushed up to he got $400 from CLD such a nice collapse the Shen comes up from Reign Over comes down on his Kindred there was no way out really bored to mate felt like he wanted fairly well there they just got caught completely off-guard by the three main collapsing do annotations profile frog following Demonte over that wall and then all the sudden rain over it's your although he is level 3 flash over the wall spray tan to Devonte and he is going to get run down keep playing exceptionally aggressive and use it all the flashes offensively getting a kill getting some pressure up on the top side but this has been coz strength if there has been one you know it hasn't the early game they've been non-stop getting first was really getting it into is there at the midden liking where they have struggled in Dover well yeah what was the kitchen sometimes nicely time and who need all the way in a loaf can't get that kind of jungle kill dad great job there from hunie you know kind of suspecting that ran over could be on those walls knowing he hadn't gone back yet he would be very low finds him guess a kill gets the Blue Dolphin going to be feeling pretty nice about that early Rome so again it's cracking what field from here there early game planning their early gameplays are almost always excellent they have some of the best kind of first 10 minutes I would say in the entire league and now I'll fight for the bodhisattva but still I help speak Deco Fox duo in the forces of the new look for their dueling just their third game together onstage they played together about 12 days now and that's all other than eBay nicely played who he put in his kit to work and get that smoothies here though they have to be careful sweetie has Flash The Flash going to land they could not do so knowing how close are talking rain over a great early start with in two back-to-back death steer him quite a bit and now it's only going on real can pierce the Heavens to do a lot of damage to avoid monster the top side as well might look at our dive soon enough for show guy who he waiting behind the wings and now. Yeah he really just want to give up this way if it's all it's a lot of gold to be had there especially with the Canon darshan now they'll have to back off he's not sick he has no TP but he's going to have to give up this way but probably for level leave for Echo Fox with from Demonte in the mid lane so I think that prompt Tackle Box to backup a v Notre Dame win the to be to they do not want that 3 V2 and shin up here on the top side jobs I don't know if they realize about boss is going to be here as well who he walks over very moody has its only go for it don't do frosted just everywhere this game 3 KP on a support check Free level six and none of them were in his lamp having a monster Libra formance in this gaming Pony getting too aggressive you has been getting punished for this to so heavily recently I'm not expecting the extra man to be there he loses his life Advantage nobody expects riverset it's been around for years but beautiful stuff in the back of a farm and a frequency ignite but this Farm comes through and honestly just impressed LG Duo top 5 ds you would not expect that when she has made three rooms away from that lane and you're a lady at the dryer work on one of the strongest early-game Elena and Duos in the game so very impressive stuff from them. I have a 6 o has flash Demonte assist as well they could look for flights going to win that is rough that was completely flashable gives the Kilauea three men did. They're going to go to play right field available as well put some some work but that is for sure going down Echoplex crap that 125 apiece for them to step forward if you need to reach out to the pain they can kill him if he does not he loses that. So good foods from the Xbox Squad winning out very heavily not only now have they gotten that skill and the CSF leak in the bottom Lane Bob Ross has been everywhere and lost only a pretty big mistake not being over the flats at max range parasol ruffstuff 500 gold deficit now I can Fox hoping to come back from scary stuff even the first to record has not made it to the fact that CLG are out farming in several places and up kills as well what's in a back-and-forth mount Drake on the table not the most important right now but might be worth scrapping over off its my throat at grab Scott on the bottom side and left-back in the two on two
today and their back to their old roster and meanwhile experiments have settled on this roster and it has been working pretty darn well they have the to a weekend last week with a pretty tough schedule and they are free in one with this current generation so that is very good especially compared to their overall record and a jongleur blabber has been very aggressive he has been playing very well looking for is a morbidly getting wins against both getting with over TSM and I bought with stinky play Queen on both games was pretty cool to see their own cake on board as strong right now and Nikki or I want to watch 46mm bands coming through I think the sort of focus on 590 super interesting again exactly this current iteration of the roster is 3 and 1 in considering the only veterans on this team are Jensen and sneaky licorice flavor in Sayville all had their lcsd used this year and if Weidman record in that small sample size pretty impressive knock them pick upwhy we're going to see how that one can go spots on their side do back-to-back zero two weeks they definitely did they really do I mean if they want to make it blasted they want to make it to Worlds they need to start doing some of these winds and about nine and similar boat I mean there's a lot of teams that you would expect to be sitting pretty in summer Split near the end of the schedule one of them have a long story history of success in the NLCS but they are 5 and 7 of they are on the outside looking in at a possibility of world's going to go pick the gym as the available bus going fishing again before old school for aggressive rock on TV and getting Picks Against The Stables Champions be very very good and said 20 to get more potent Poison. Control stated by Zanesville on the supportwalk inside 1e and if you can answer that fairly well keep this Jen safe against against the roof from the Sia guess is Ronnie L Smith in looking pretty good we'll see how blabber is going to perform on the Nocturne which has in a very highly prized Champion throughout competitive play a mean it's one of the highest van rates in open up and then I grabbed it in mediately second phase advancement through Gangplank about to go to a cloud nine with make their Force Band of the game and I'll wait to see what comes through we have much at the previous game the same role pick in the first round both solos waiting to be seen Zoey to come around going to be a face to ban for Cloud 9 1 / 2 event do I think has been largely pretty good on the champion is most played though is Wayne and that one still so faris it be able to be play good look for that if he wants to go that direction and I think I can beat fairly good at into what fun is showing already is another word for not really actually Converse down and get on to build naturally to do near as I can be pretty disruptive and thank you in the front line and kind of free space for that's Tire on to really work their magic in the late game he bites you comes to print you a lot more cuz right now but I'm throwing a lot of good split push power right content Brinkmann over knock knock the old thing to a side lane and if you want if you want to play like a Fiora or something up there that we just sit there. Last week you are the same. Have a good support for that to make that back if I could go very well of course you can turn it on his head on the flip side though they're a good bunch of heavily out damaged gin and if I'm 15 fighting cho'gath I can withstand length of wasp and Frontline first though750 splitfoot I wouldn't say you want to pick up your style mash-up in the Top Lane could go for a Buddha also is available that's going to be easier answer as far as this one that has some lien priority in the sidelines play a Jensen could drop by mid laner also and then have a little bit more of that threat as you said Oriana could be something that is pretty strong or Jana and Nocturne are a very powerful combo and he's going to give you a lot of steam pipe damage in the later stages the game Jensen as a starting mid laner not funnels half his game so far has been on Oriana's 3 on that one and away so could be gained number for here looking to kind of push together 18 V composition I think not quite as well rid of nose is zillion a new look here for Jensen wants to Blindin the mid lane and hope that's just have a mundo Bita everything forever making super fast in fact that knocked her and runs Celerity and giving him more boost be me to get even more attack damage there's a lot of small Synergy Seeker that be fun to watch for and there is indeed that's way from Heaven play was that that prompted that has yet to lose on Oriana to split it is his most played all time can be in one of his best game I've ever actually never lost any exactly 5 + 1 zillion also was very impressive but if you get the late game 5 E-5 can you actually match up and be able to to punch through a big swing with his own is in this a 20 until got to do that is not the highestyes and then Nocturne really wants to be kind of diving on a squishy Target and not dealing with that Frontline so yeah it is the concern there but if you get a heads-up that no longer matters but we'll see what they can do I do want to speak to run with a bit more of an interesting game plan in this one because I grew up in the Batman v does not look C9 favorite but they have been on a very good run right now three and one with the roster of Azazel and bladder in the lineup the New Edition from the previous split here in Rockledge gaining back to the starting roster but as rocks as done four and six so far the splits biggest 4th Place finishers have not looked as good as they did in Spring and capacities at best but open with a new look in a new week they can look a whole lot better quite a lot of comfort on this team lot of changes to know how to play Clash alone in last place I knew about quite well order the split both these teams dokkan turn their Fates around we'll see what they can do c9ty for 6 pick up in the standings clutch can come up that spot as wellbetter run of it recently this ties in the standings if clutch wins so I could certainly would love Scrabble win here going to reverse of the fortunes they have been having recently I worth noting some of the master choices here is lethal Tempo there for the Ziah which is going to be very effective is hail of blades jhin so again Africa and acting higher towards the damage and and left it on Surviving laying with things like Fleet footwork there's also going for a spell book and husband has become more more popular I really do think it's just interchangeable on any Champion that is going to go Guardian is his word you can also just go to spell book and have a little bit more utility but I feel like I haven't seen anyone use it super well so I'm kind of a little bit unconvinced on on how much value is having you generally as you pointed out in the previous game they grab a teepee they come back to Lane but mostly it feel like people are just sitting on their default Summoner and then it's it's that muchthanks guys I'm here with creating new coach for clutch you finish your first champ select how did it go for you but I mean I didn't think I was too much of a big deal I was pretty nervous going on stage for the first time but I think once I got out there have all the nerves going away and business but wishing you the best of luck thank you back to the desk if we go we'll see if but when does Game Theory is officially so sickly the best pink bandana list of all time on defeated in Fresh Meadows only result time it is nice to see another a new coach on the stage andfighting for him to be able to get up there and make it happen if you are on level 2-4 this Jensen stealing but right now bit down in farm as you expect for a push what are the two on two level two is going to be pretty closely tied but I was going over to right here for a clutch and you can see that goes about 9 to go to the naw, not quite damaged and I still trade is there now they are down here on the bottom side of the map as well but not sure that the lady is really going to be in a spot where he can actually feel pretty gangster zillion is very effective is far more items for CBR it feels really hard to pressure the champion at a very much so can cuz Wayfair endlessly flapper is level 3 though in it for the bottom sides of this makes it pretty difficult actually get in there nice spell she'll do anything to be a force flash out and I sent the game can good time and everything else right there and really waiting to cast a beetle after the clock hands passand then it's time for the routing portion of it and I'll blabber will be going ahead and grabbing this site without really any issues almost guarantee none of those forces of flash because if you get hit by the sun there you're going to get food out of that and then you may be getting broke down so your sexual flag from 7 good job I've learned density of the group up in and make that work in what is the Toronto from Midland Nocturne zillion not the dynamic do you think is going to connect group up in and get that early kill but hey the force of The Flash early they returned they get that kill no summers use either by 5 if it's a really good bit of pressure here I from laverge engine only down one Camp right now for the cost of a gangsta me through soBrothers Nocturne op 400 go look at it to under the bottom Lena is pretty equal trade of farm and the top slide also only plus or minus three licorice did get kind of a year we want to thank you again though set up a time or place to slow it really makes it almost impossible to actually Dodge especially in the later stages the game with that float and go up to 99% and set up there with no flash on. Washington DC not active this early in the game so really not much you can do to get rid of that one 40% slowed but still enough to make sure the bombs can land and almost all situations when I sit down and not quite that you could have been needed a date for a while and I didn't expect you to be the one going to prison you could give at 8 if that's been is down flash maybe he should be playing no more towards the bottom side or more on we're jungler is or perhaps there should haveI'll bring their that's kind of what you have to look at it because the ones are already in that situation there's no way out but there are things you can obviously do in advance to try to prevent yourself from getting the situation in the first place in farming well he is still up some and in the farm department and it will be scaling up on this way and that he has had a fair bit of support on this way and I have to be back in Jensen actually himself walked so still have that one aside land sometime down the line still left in the camp difference in the jungle Uso still good job to blabber getting to GameStop and keeping up in crime against the wind is Brian about Lee not going to land it but it said I should be good to follow through a seeing-eye side and then if we are now a juul in the river is not quit going to get the spear alive still that means they actually get to schedule control in fiber will be able to grab another shuttlecraft feel as it's actually a lot of experience a lot of gold in these early stages and that is becausecould come up knowing that Jensen is going to be the first actually Roman 2/4 are Lyrica not fighting really those advantages that he kind of gave up that are now coming coming back him and helping him out but not until 6 right now going on for climbers up to right now if it's raining tacos quit going to get any kills but yeah well off the lane and Weber didn't get fish wife by himself but nicely responded to the dive was good here from Cloud 9 but the TP Wards you're not in place really in time for liquor to join with the rest of the squad and it's actually watch that responds back of this is the Acer Predator replay here sneaky devil have them chunky low The Flash mask their Bible ever goes in able to get one filter able to chase it down and going back in but if you can see who do not actually answer nearly as quickly toward she was there so we could ask EP there of the TV is also available for Jensen not sure if he didn't think you needed to join or maybe didn't he could join but had both the soul enters TP do that laneworth for cloud nine I think that fight was massively differently being silly and also someone who do is there a lot faster maybe straight up win. On that play slow but it went so fucking actually the first blood and it was going to kill in the beginning to teleport down make it later on in the massively ahead up 7 Pharmacy equal TP uses for his help a student really goes down anything and is Rich yeah I mean I think if you're on cloud nine side you're happy of where those pills when not that they were giving up but at least it is not on festival at least it is not on Apollo those guys he's really would be more worried about
at the top of the table and they are going to be competing for sole possession of first place are you here we go right off the bat the picks and bans have begun a truck still banned he's not wanted to play around anymore. I know rakaan for old and make some plays either and we did talk about last weekend of he's not be able to play with funnel anymore and the interview with Frawley and I forget which other players talk with the fact that fellow seems to be dead I'm not sure it truly is but maybe not in the Playbook this week it would be kind of a reinvention of a strategy war of a sharing of gold between two people that are just full gold bullion to one person until that jungle item is completed at least either way not turn and aatrox to the Mainstay for band on the read side-scan it's going to be grabbing his Kindred in this is a pretty exciting one for me and one of those kind of early adopters of Kindred way back in the daywill be the second play of the split and conspicuously though it has gone through the first pick. Being grabbed right now she's been a very popular bit later did get some nurse 8:14 and right now still no rush Jeff brohm grab her after you down to the bottom Lane and we had heard the various players are the analysts during the countdown to the wind condition worth for Team Liquid at 1 a double to have Lain pressure playing in such as a blade of the ruined King veristor a storm razor work in my field trip Marshfield right now there is brown can be very strong Duo there are pistachio pudding survive that's just what they want to be going through the the band is kind of more circumspect with them the other team's players enough they couldn't pick it up but between the two of them there is one play and that is this on the side of a re you so see if you is going to grab that up for himselfor if it's it just a matter of this keeps feeling like they have a good answer to it the answer is there has to be a chance to ban it away afterwards I diffuse have an uncontested final pick of the midline or something else in the first pumpkin Dash in the bottle in plenty of Crocker Hill and see if they need it but not terribly so I think he's playing pretty well so far to split king of the jungle also has plenty of pressure available to people in fact his match Lane rosters right now is trouble comes in for a jungle has an don't play that what are the things that is always an advantage of drafting against DL is is almost always you feel like impact is going to come as default appointment at thank you camp and if he's playing thank the champion you can kind of more comfortably pick I trundled knowing that there's like we going to be a tank to actually all first asked to see a lot of people actually can free counterpick tanks as wellresult in win but it is something that can help each team in the draft and I think that's kind of a what hundred years is looking at here with that tremble pick as it's not the best match of individually into the Kindred and you would have hoped to have a thank y'all wouldn't let the teams right here you can see we do have to look at playing with their two coaches dodo and now pain right here of course Frawley Alone by himself coaching the team decided to make with Four Paws to get flare I trust them to know that a place that you can wait for the camp so I could be okay either way it is on their side you would they are still worried about some potential other non tanks but if you remove the option more likely to play a tank and you can put your style of course and and the GP ban kind of tells me that impact does want to play a tank though you know what would your GPA be all right you know what is GP than good into that is generally tank matchups were GPS has a pretty favorable time there and somebody obviously isn't very strong game playeris it that you most often does Platos hang fix the ugly has a playdate Rocky athletic and some of these other Champion another champion that you do not have considered one of those Champion he's very good into tank match up so expecting something brass like a mudo to come through here for impact something along those lines could be as well if they want more engage but having gas make the I think lots of requirement so are you going to reprise his role on this do is hit me that gets locked in go through a solid 6 picks Ben 10 bands and Zoe Salon table light lower priority across the world but actually his first doubled up Champion pic of the entire split for Mid laner as far as I'm concerned he's played to flatten the bottomlands like that one character liquid looks like it's going to be syndra at least that's what they consider to be very good jokein truth, like so he's not a more mid-range semi that you can equalize Lanes very easily once you get this once you have a little a little bit of a very well for the Kindred here by the Smithy is going to be playing and also the follow up on any potential act engages with that Chris Alero front of a very powerful there is expected impact is going to a tank that is kind of his natural play style in the band did kind of the word that as well but it's not going to be any truly bad mad if I do think that has priority over the 10 for shenmue do early even with that Advantage as long as they packed with bling intelligently is playing safely it shouldn't be that bad that being said though anytime you're playing choke at the champion that canfor 5000 HP you are then making and a on this trundle so much more Tanki in that does give them much more of a an easy opportunity kind of burned down impact definitely agree to watch the lineups here to look at the pretty conventional comes near double tank in the front lines get advice from Jungle are fairly Mitchell Marksman down for double if not we see a ton of North America but hasn't popular worldwide filter on a second malzahar pretty conventional Mage right here cuz there's your lineup for team liquid in the force on the hundred decide pretty standard stuff here as they switch the champions in for you dr. Mundo not it doesn't surprise me Sophie how could the coach handshake is a timer 6 down the end of cons and probablyThe rosters top winners junglers midlane. Lane and support welcome to summoner's Rift Team Liquid versus hundred thieves a rematch of the spring split finals Team Liquid one that 320 now it's time for the summer split rematches they do battle here today Wicked one of the first time as well as the battle comes down the Midlands actually you do you go up there and you fight to try to push back the opposing team so that you're done working kind of sneak in there and gets bought it will be put back in the end result in your butt butt Explosive Start yeah yeah yeah I can actually hear me through this Valley is going to be a bad recall any trading back and forth here but certainly does going to pay 400 East and maybe stay around and try to take this Red Bluff if he comes over into them it could be really bad for you know they're they're going to land some pictures around which barrier Shield cuz you as well and that was it out to flashes on this invade even done any damage to Canada down down on HP on the other side of the map in hide a camera flashes down on the tailbali and as well so and I could look for a Yankee or do the pillar later on early 4/4 belt replacement level 1 did not have good ways out of that one and I can't even take us to the other side of the map is truly safe Lil Wayne started his first cab best route all right I mean this is brutal I don't really understand why he's even staying around what are you going to do you have your W your level one are you really going to be able to actually get over the wall and try to use in Canasta can't I think it's extremely unlikely so no needed maybe just cut his losses and start I just called him he can't do he can't do the Scuttle either you still have one fills your OCS like I don't really get what the game plan is. It's really tough though because Kindred is so bad at actually doing the Raptors lose all your help if you try to do Raptors at level one you really die or at least very least a few spider boss so he's working out start of wolves all right beat level 3 to level one he's just now starting his first camp and going to get it about 4 minutes into the game the 4-minute level two is maybe not quite the goals there I think I would be willing to bet this is one of the worst start ever in a professional game for a jongleur latest level 2 diver seen I'll be very interested to see stats on that but it means you lose his boss cuddles he gets for bucked he dies like this is an absurd Advantage for and onion and the game is now in in does hands right like you should be the one who are being proactive from this point in you know I would like to see him you to put that pressure on for my break they got all the flashes from CL Spotlight at 1 p.m. to get down there look for a place there I think that is a tremendously eezygang to make when you do have that frontal pillar is having never use Smite he had to charge right away so the Wolves weren't back in but obviously he really really painful rough start here with your back North mid lane pobelter actually doing a good job in the landing phase that's a good farm from self it's the temperature is going to be quicker to just accept all right I can't get that start somewhere else do you know give up the minimum but because he decided to a stay around for the red beetle won't be 3 Thang is pushed off that then he kind of has a son just doing wolves he tries to go to Scuttle still level one can't do that either well now you're going to lose your blue then he doesn't want to give up the blue so now you're going to die and it tasted really snowball start already sucks let's make it as as kind of manageable as possible and just immediately walked wolves start wolves and then hit level two and go from there well right now A5 camp veranda and we'll see what street it looks like yours is going to go to lead is too much what you'd expect out of that one thing real quick to stantial up for double Pinole a it is going to be teleport for this ash down here by the way and yeah there's the pretty softball and start + 14 CF Pro play almost always you're seeing you no lunch or three pot or food for Fallout ordering something along those lines so this is super kind of out of left field in I do think that it makes your Burleigh Lane in a lot weaker I do think that it'll in the long run it's going to kind of be a more valuable item because every time you go back to basic any additional value from this but I do like that and it in over on that infernal will be able to pick up this from self easily and that is because of your vanity is gabion utterly game so fast it does have paying forward towards later the river is like what I mean Division. And then have a chance of passing his back walkover get to give it up but now fighting the topside those things are built in fact has the chomp of course at Sunday Park supposed to go down to the big trade walks away someday so far up a little bit in the top way that is expected you know you can you do for the Foley a little bit of such a bad level six but uses his ultimate on cream cheese actually stacking just kind of looking forward toward that later save the game in as long as you play Bentley how you get so much calcium in it back from your past it from farming these Minions that I shouldn't be under any threat of dying really unless it don't go to shows up and what is the I am a little bit disappointed that and it didn't actually kind of return back to bottom line with no flashes are especially because of the TL bottom Lane has been pressuring as you have pointed out but you know you can
communication is extremely important as his removing clutter from Ponce right you know you if you want to communicate everything that is important without all the extra garbage that can sometimes then and make it very confusing the important calls and cool-downs that are actually being used in and monitored by the weight JJ certainly has impressed so far but there have been critics of flyquest still you know they are sitting at the table table tied for first 6 and 4 but a lot of their wins have looked somewhat shaky they have been picking up wins that perhaps they shouldn't have gotten based on the game State you know he was last week against how to use they were literally behind hundred views from Austin to and then boxes the Space Race wear plaid was barely wins out is there are still some questions that would be very impressive to see them get a win over a top speed will be nice to see of course the question was sort of Romaine does Xbox count as a dominant team right now with a lot of the roster shaken up I think the month has been very very goodexpects me to be quite incredible I did see his foot up last week talking about his transition from cloud and Echo Fox News bed I lost a lot of confidence in the game changed the whole lot I no longer knew what we could always take advantage of what do I do when I got a lot quieter are you kind of lame a little bit of himself in the game is as part of the opportunity once again to start on the LPS station will see if he feels more comfortable now in the middle of week 6 into Newton per and you know this is a team that they have very different want or need from his. Calling abilities when you look at Pony and doc say to me I have always been friends of the flagship view of echo Fox Lair of the guys that are often dictating the pace of the game calling the shots doing what they want to do in the rest of the team is working at this building at playing around them we'll see if that changes with me if he can step towards which. Calling rollremember this braid happened a couple days ago right that has not been long. It's not like they were on Academy Ave no practice really you have to think besides the last couple days so as it do that could take some time to polish up as well know things to watch for hear 50 seconds ago for the beginning of the band face I want to point out that flame has soft counter picks himself with the moon do in the gang slang defeat the big pick up to counteract that one for skinny on a fairly comfortable high damage character here playing with themselves being the gang all over here either way we have the Kindred picked up early for Santorum that could look very very good fortune for JJ puts a lot of power in his hands and I think he's been mostly good decisions here on the LCS State game on the on the wrong end of this matchup you know a couple of times and he actually did lose the match of his DPheavily we had all those eat Sunday, play the opposite side and went on that side too very heavily on his defeat right now you know certainly I would say that it is very well get a farm leading and have maybe a little bit of pressure or whatever but it's more about just getting to his items and then taking over where the muto certainly can win in the early stages and I was down one item can actually have an opportunity to bully to GP lot of it comes down to how well do using the barrels who's winning the Mini-Game of the last hit on that Barrel in a lot of things like that and that's one of the character I think the quote I heard was like any other Champion right now that it was going to be very good pickets in the game so happy. Into it. Catch down there we don't know their jungle in mid just yetlast week I was playing TV in the Darius with 30 or 40 minutes before things kind of started going bad in that one do you want and you know if the flame who has not been performing as well it does kind of get isolated there with honey. That could spell some bad things for them that being said it's always going to be that through 1 B-1 there is a chance to forward it to me here for JJ house that has the ability to be with the same United to go up to the Top Lane to kind of pylon to Hootie and Tony has been very susceptible to do that while giving up many many kind of isolated death trap is splitting in general does not performing as well as as we have going to come to expect out of money and Camille back in the lineup soccerare they kind of coming back in line of credit in Fort Lee disappeared in the nerves of 8.12 or not lasting like 50 damage at MAX train with a really really big Nerf that ability galio will be home from those dice meal with the GP also named yet it is not the galley Ocampo but GP Oliphant layers extremely well over that Camille ultimate also and it's someone who really can't help the lock down and take down the moon do you have enough first of those two Champions to really look to do that but obviously that ends with a global Ultimate Looks to respond with a semi go to Ultimate can also look to respond to and kind of protect do also have to always mention the galio + Kindred ultimate interaction if you actually use that Kendra ultimate early you can find the galley ultimate so that says he is landing right out of that ultimate inGucci Mane is coming out of that lamp to spite you so you can birth people down there cc2 knocked up and that could be tough to deal with you but you can still be sealed as though there's lots of ways to kind of keep alive throughout that game play and we'll see you the one after locked in for them to watch for damaged left hand side out of echo-fox our first look at the new lineup they're promoted Academy kiwibot later in Lost I've got food over from Cloud 9 was sitting in the academy bench down there and back in the starting roster this year if you have a great roster on their own Sky have looked very very good at first place Contender right now they're ready to play our games of League of Legends third game of the day of battle at first place at the fox picking up like Westgoing to be really interesting also you must be kind of look at lost in isolation in this game because yes Academy throughout the split but they are sitting at 2:10 and as a result in a loss is obviously if they're losing all their strong individually but it's sometimes hard to tell how much of that is because it's performing around you and how much of that is you individually not performing that well. He now is is surrounded by too much more known quantities and if he can perform on this level then you can start to think okay well maybe he is very good individually but the team in Academy was just not working of course we'll see if the LCS team to work the third-place finisher from Spring hope to make it very good here at the fox and the rest of the teams can be caught at the studio in Los Angeles tickets are available. Com tickets come hang out with us we love you all very very muchthank you you don't care about me as often apparently there was like four people doing to show your love to prove your love to them everyday talk about League of Legend Oaks school that was available to I put up with the sale I care that much sharing is caring for a kind of match up nicely there you go to Synergy door into the gameI sent are going to be starting his buff still on the top side and a lot of some kind of come down to if there's a point of conflict is is where that kid rock Johnny exactly what I want on that first Scuttle tablespoons on the bottom side of that is where he's looking to clear to he's trying to avoid any potential interaction with Darla cuz you're expecting garlic to clear trip to the topside and it just one of the but first though there's no point really even even trying he's just actually go over and just do the mark because he's already failed at that point right so you're kind of just putting yourself behind a little bit and is pushing up he will go grab this not irregardless and it's time to see what the response is going to be dark was spotted going into this topside there's a war that it didn't fire it was in the river, but they could look so actually performed I fear of din level three digit do the hookshot though that's actually 12 seconds to go so we're looking at is always an option when I was down and looked at 6 to go for a later dive a general you're trying to actually get that. Happening on the mudo free picks because once stopwatch comes in at eight minutes stopwatch for the ultimate definitely need your undeniable unless it is ridiculously bad situation but very fortunate spawns on these marks already too easy marks both bonding on the bottom side of a map where he had control and he could very easily be sitting at 0 / going to check in with Echo Fox coach think about what's been going on this week thanks guys Aspen card about their newest 80 carrier lost he says that he thinks that loss is an incredibly smart and mechanically skilled player and that just to help with a little bit of stage fright little bit of nerves on stage today he's going to be picking up his comfort pick embarrass back to you guys it's very different playing in front of a crowd like this playing a part of the bigger audience you know there's more pressure so no limits of those variables You Can Depend more on on on the reactions enough to pick through his when he moves when it's like I can't even play all the time all right now though keen on the back foot right here to Monte who's had I think an absolutely Stellar summer split so far with Echo Fox I think it's been mostly all great game that I am here plus nine of us Calliope being shoved away a bit here and Echo Fox 4 and a gold up some of that being Gangplank exist but I'm quite nicely they got a solid Camp lead on tarlochan and a half away for so far Devonte and centaurion trying to sneak around here behind hunie actually managed to avoid all the vision so they could look for this but I think I probably have any play this is fairly low but got up there I was getting play run that one right now is it time to go to the cutest guy he's got nowhere to go for blood picked up nicely done assure that pretty smartly to know he's the only one who can actually really get killed there so he kind of just gets a little bit of damage in them fax off and honestly from santorin avoiding that Ward and be right back into a parked car. It's actually stay decides not to but that is one of the most devastating things I can actually happened to you as a top player in this game is when the wave is a Frozen song Frozen again in to die here it is one more time playing very low nosy kind of fun to try to avoid this Barrel so it's a little bit of damage does that mean you're not going to find a mate for the we get to come through does Donna go on in and out the TV channel flame had at least started know it was actually wildturtle try to join but now it's the chase down if there is no DP electric to go in as well kill in the mid lane that 5 went well have to be careful. he's going to hit six soon Darla has moved his way up here should have been spotted by that Ward and we'll see though I mean out now this is flame retardant also he does have stopwatch a couple minutes but that's not going to be available in the area so his dive likely will go bad if they try it but it was around there they call it off till throw some clippers at minions throw some Cleavers and Tony and lasted most the Restless have fun at the Wake County still maintaining the pressure so again doing fairly well in that isolated 1D one but Falling prey to the game he does like to play very aggressively and see how you have to play to really create does big individual advantages that he can get but that exposes you how to Gangsta and if you don't have full vision if you do not have your keys in there to back you up yeah then sometimes you're giving up too much and you need to know maybe needs to learn to walk that line little bit better I suppose so one thing I want to point out that was a very crucial just timing. Cooney died when he had money for his Sheen I think if he gets back in the latest Bill sapphire crystal that's a very different look when he comes back in and I wish I could take an on-purpose recall this time picking up some more static doran's blade and a dagger I believe both picked up here so more sustained more durability case to another game I would have kind of things back if you want to look at more durability just grab a ruby Crystal and work towards that fade something along those lines because Dorrance + dagger could just be no Ruby Crystal underwater store for that beat Shazam download has more but it does give him more immediate hour if he's trying to kind of brawl fight us again claimed as to who has been known to do he really does like to take those Greta trades that fights for the past hour protocol slightly delayed for me for splits might not mean too much on his side of help you be able to keep in mind that game Plinko is the one Global and foxes side and of course Galley other one Global on flakka West so that is why we have two dogs can wander a donkey
optic very close to the standings 5 and 5 vs 4 and 6 liter of these rosters this one so far enough the band list as well when does see that that's pride and crew North American knock from a Trucks Band it off tickets to the Indy actually think there's no pics that are competitively viable that beat him in Lane Self you know it is one of those required bands right now unless someone is willing to actually really put in the time to repair a strategy against a rock to try to shut us down then we're probably not going to be good but not going to run around that didn't work quite well leave a truck stop in of course yes instant first pics of dhokla versus darshan and if they know I've got something for you and he's going to say it's a percentdead from Newcastle were in the NLCS earlier today that would be very exciting I do think there are some matches that I can actually I do fairly well they found my soul acute into the atrox minutes lucarelli well into aatrox icg or do very well the errand is another one has Billy going to see all of those sorts of pics on the LCS stage especially because people just dealing with which is not really working in this metal that is much more about drinking and fighting. Which makes it very difficult for someone like a few Arthur really have to accept you if you're doing well as laying play defensively sacrifice Lane a little bit give that up in some ways and I'm kind of looking for more of a reason later threw in in later right now off to get blocked in what I consider to be number one comfort for gold Acadian and arrow at 8:18 grades at super good his best camping air I think definitely didn't is that as well I don't think I've been quite to the samehe was back on Phoenix one but on David like the Braves game actually I'll just look for a gadia that he has been a longtime Pro player has been absolutely excellent on it the trundle as well as the rakan here for CLT Trumbull is fine even if there is not a true tank picked up biotic but don't let has really been say want that to go if it was talking about what is actually kind of walking off to can do much more with split push style of play what are the reasons that this is so effective is that it's so damn easy to actually Perry and stun the a dropped off of one of the sweet spot on the Q how you can also do in the early to Q's the first and second you can actually Dash inside of that sweet spot on the floor and start engaging in that fight when the third Pew for the big damage comes upread that very easily and you can kind of continue forward in that all in that being said a truck can still push in and look to bullies if you're in the early levels I thought sometimes big forward to some time to get going as we all know that I wanted to see the opening of the match up when we started seeing aatrox Rift Rivals I got fewer what's going to be the one we seeing if you're in trouble for I know you mentioned earlier lot of frozen dumplings in the viable option to end game but we saw the echo Fox Renekton in a row a lot of things a different result was good for was the one I want to hear midnight but I know we really see much as so kind of interesting that they are actually Banning out of the Heimer despite the fact is about laying her was already picked Baby Huey has been kind of using that in scriptis the current one of the guys to be willing to actually get to mix things up a little bit more in that regard I do have a bra on paired up with the gym though a pretty stable steady bottom Lane and they want them sort of a leaf along with the team and I think it does make sense especially with double Marksman Braun always were so curly well blocking out damn it for them as well as being a flu private passive which they can then Fox News on the squad good story out of the picking for who he in the Middle Lane which means we know where most people are going but 20 seconds ago for the last pic I don't expect to LeBlanc cover but who knows already bought let it go see if you was 6 days late but he has been here for CLG fan the weather can't work on but as real force a pretty big Mainstay for 6 people tie his most played at 3 now Oriana not a surprise or who he either still do planksrecently a bunch of Charmed race in the early game is the major benefits are so many cops while I do believe so already back in the mix power of you bringing that one out of here with that you're into HR to the stop sign. Worldwide a once in North American Academy and once in awhile but either way it won both games do me very excited see how this thing doesn't go down high-risk high-reward Optics adopting into a split push style play with your filter have drafted for an assassin here on the re whichafraid if they fall behind the game is likely to end pretty quickly definitely is going to be some to wash for Wayfair not the strongest strength on the opposite side either way as we are loading into this one optic came into the day alone in ninth place on the outside looking in hoping to find their way up Fords in the standing expectorate they had the same still outside looking in. So far the Springfield open make it a little better now is that come in throughout summer missed playoffs 7th place finisher in Spring split 5 and 5 yearhyper V would make it towards that first place spot hoping to make it towards that world's run their third title also worth noting optic running for TPS still Jeep running 100 pretty Stark differences there on what the two teams are trying to do as as we said optic is kind of opting in to Morrisville push style spread the map be able to have that Wave Control it all time in the sidelines and 40 piece is going to help you do that. The question becomes are you at too much of a disadvantage because of all these additional combat Summoners can you not then when your legs because of that I mean it's double, Simon Earth you have the healing ignite for CLG how you would hope if they could then utilize that's going to get some more of an advantage on the bottom of the map but you can't force an all-in TV is going to be more effective if it is as it was one of the very first ones to bring teleport. Lena dimensional Marksman and it caught on for other champagne afterwards but the idea was rushing back to your first year at in a 750 gold or whatever in and stacking up quite early on to the game I do think he'll make scored me two cents in his composition though there's a lot of burst coming out of the optic Squad and either generally you're probably going to be lit if you don't die instantly you probably have a good ability to recover and then win that fight against Champions like Fiora and so on and we are going to see if you were actually playing in grass grass is pretty pretty standard these days actually work your adopted a nap very easy to just constantly use your cues dashing forward and with that lunge and you're always out of the medians of the grass is always ready and then you're trying to jump forward rocket vital praca grass and you have to essentially that's the only real trading you use just these cues on pulled out but it can be very very effective and it's very frustrating actually to Lane against describe one way that Katie and I think I'll ever won for the goat or down in that River brush and I got scared out straight or fighting over the scuttles tonight is up for both players or 10 picked up my scent of the help I drop a little Portuguese can I see sometimes with the auto tech grab stops cuddling occasion waste a few second trimester happen during that Scuttle away from Acadian as he is training it down he just making sure to stay on the bottom side to push it up two words with that top side of the river and there is that way I'm talking about dashing in progress Proctor pie dough that's what you're trying to do, but even with his kind of advantageous match up again as I said HR can put you in early HSN I have a Laney advantage in those early phases and you are cats supposed to be expected so there's not a lot of damned if you don't follow up with an auto attack but at least mine just done maybe get a little bit back there is Farm Credit back and forth yeah we should be who he spot that I can take him to the Raptors away but can't stop him and I still use one chicken back to eat that came from responding and it keeps seeing ghosts poros come down for those who do have the domination tree ran over looking for the stuff on the side of the map and you'll find Crocs the end of the day Saphira and you have a truck was just really can be very powerful in the early phases do not get them back with the w but he has to take over the dive that carry Beyond cooldown rate over should honestly could get over there forget about the wave in her walking towards the champion so I think you need to finish the way the trip so hard driving without having taking it so hard it is tough but at the same time they're not giving him time for the repose to come back up as well so level four. To teleport out and the threat of the reprieve going to be enough but I may be waiting for that supposed to be back up could have been too much a TV started them canceled Peewee keep steamed it a lot it's tough right it's hard to know what is the right decision to make in that moment but no generally I feel that if you are trying to go for early dive against if you are all that were both similar with Jackson's all about the counter strike that defensive tool is really what they have to keep them alive and you know that they canceled TV coming out from power of evil is something especially when you have to remember 60 seconds even on that cancel so he's not going to have that the comeback for Lane and it does hurt his laying a decent amount these guys that would teen said that Optics morale and everyone on the team is pretty happy after 420 from last week he says that they're pretty confident draft that they have right now and that they've been working on it all week so then who he is going to have some trouble against Peohe's in Uwharrie cuz he's going to bring that back into the meta back to you guys very cool stuff and they should be confident coming off of a very very strong weak because shown also it in these pics write the fact that they're willing it to take for your into the detox leaving it up and also going with the sorry and I'm going to be very powerful fix get played very well and that's funny because while there is Champions like you must been a lot of times that results in prose not practicing it because you're so powerful they like well no one's ever going to let me play it but why would I waste my time put again in practice games so when you do that leave it up you were expecting that do glass spend time this week screaming this exact match up bright and perfecting this exact match up in you offer darshan there's a chance he didn't play a single game of it this whole weekend a very high chance he is not played this matchup this week so your backyard come and go in the favor of the team that has prepared this strategy and I will always respect believe this but we think we have the answer and are willing to make that risk I do love that especially if you are on the outside like optic are it's even more reason to do that because you need to check something up a little bit slow but not quite the rest of it here so far holding equal in laying again because he concern was planning to use is unbeatable and so far holding up his fight even getting ganked once is dokha of course the power to get shifted a dark running late game Powers going to be that must be banned or you think that you are certainly is going to have the scaling invented there you know these bites should just the better and better for a few are as time goes on and certainly are going to want to try to play around that try to get dhoka his advances at least protect him and that's all I make sure that he can't get though can't get ganked because if you do get behind it's going to be rough neck we try to be forced into joining those he fights a reason that people really happened kind of avoiding the slip Bush's darshan still do your very eyes trade with hitting sweet spot on to q's and deathbringer stances getting natural a grievous wounds application which is pretty big butt Acadia is in the area they have a thing for it in the river though power of evil roaming out there trying to make a free man play I'm going for a 302 trundles right around the corner going to pick up Alaska and waiting to join the team that black Konya is up and that's not going to happen dope looking incredibly tired I really be gone for a little bit of damage no naka says yes so pulling aggro Joe's walk away from that one and only get half course that's after you open it will take for the Dive Right now I got a hard to kill yeah becomes all about the Perry the facts indicating comes over though does protect him and that's a very big allowing him to stay around and actually collected waved at the experience of gold now they're going to try to go around the closest angostura bitters slow right now 240 turn around the tower dive. Just checking flash out of the third Matrix avoiding so
to be with their storied history but you know I think C9 for them it's so important going to prove their fans that they are improving that they are getting better at it for now having traded away smoothie and Azazel is their go-to guy fans want to see daisa perform they want to see good stuff out of him as they're really kind of have confidence in Cloud 9 and basically all likelihood in the same boat as well as probably impossible to win all your games and not make plaster Point self still room to improve in room to make that postseason work a blue side a Chach Ben anything enough for TSM of course it's the first Racine up at 8:14 in North America Zoe Interstate Truck Center teleport nursetalk about during the NLCS countdown also we saw the EU LCS playlist act as well as well as North Bergen Academy Viper playing T-Mobile out of the ordinary does come out here for a standard stop it does give him the ability to create a lot of flies for himself though and to be a fairly proactive about that I want to try in the game as far as eating goes own pics of finding wait actually wrote down the bar room at the top and really 10 take over again definitely a very strong she went down in the past and is it right now in the jungle for bladder is 1 + 0 on the champion last week but of course still in the line of fear 10.9 they like the one on results bed of most there was also been so they keptthe right now by the way has won only want to see if they play again here and look how that data to see if you want to keep playing that style has brought me blocked in the site that staff for the LCS Iris Lee sneaky I was playing a ton of marksman in in the academy academy and obviously is very proficient on those Champion so certainly I could be looking for that style of Play No had heard a lot of talk from soda Pro players about the fact they thought Mark going to be moving even more back in the Middle with the TV nurses they felt the same age as we're going to more dependent on that teepee out if it does have come through or if we're just going to see more of the same style of play and then going to be lacking in was almost definitely his second Zion game of the split he himself once win the 100m otherwise I'll Mages Force are all marked himselfdefend the main starter for the entire split here for TSM is thought I am very quickly lock in this movie counter pick there and they are going to be red side so they have the ability to actually stay there last pic for licorice here as well that is certainly one of the advantages on the right side though most people are talking about blue side as having a pretty heavy Advantage because a lot of the Mustang that there are on red either way will be a good match up there for Denton and no dust out of lead me to believe that you're going to get another Mark been another kind of hiking GPS Source from the bot Lane perhaps Lulu is very strong alongside those marks in bumping them up supporting them and with Brom there also a very easy to proc that from passive with double marksman to have a lot of teams buy presents and strengthdefinitely reclined so far pretty well-rounded life not a crap to the only does so much but at least some sort of the line up right there and feed them can grab that died without much issue unless I'm in Rush Cricket which I guess it could be a possibility wait to see what comes out of this one is good places I already won final band 40s music pics of the cutoff to go for something like bleach and Brawn which is a very strong bot Lane Duo I'll grab a little bit more magic damage perhaps up in the Top Lane even with something like no magic damage healing tank like a gragas is fairly popular these days, but there's also things along the lines of what they want no Marksman who is going to be able to build more that AP style of built it up a lot of options here on the table for cloud nine kind of if you take away the Ziah are you really like denying more than your kind of hurting yourself right and I think a lot of people right now feel that work on is so strong even on his own that you feelreally need that pairing and yep vs. River, North Tazewell but before still work picking up on TSN plaid Dr munasifi the lock-in for Cloud 9 de abandonar and leave up the Darius to within a common County sick as well we'll see if I have to play that as I could come in left-hand side, but it is still very strong pic into the moon do quite as something that I've been thinking of more of it also I do think is a very very strong match up into the moon do you say fine it just kind of a safe flight take if you do want just another front liner there but it is I would say an advantageous match up for the moon do to your kind of you know self counter picking a little bit there Mundo does generally feel extremely well into all sorts of tanks and the flashing of the T-Mobile bought shut off to a Viper there from Griffin in the lck doubt I would get it when there is a possibility I like twin a lot has been expunged balling for awhile has rishta popularity recently though the last couple of months to watch out for you in 3 rolls like in Top Lane Midland Bob Lane highest win rate. Very strong Champion can be played very very well in that bot Lane and also has a lot of potential it can be can be trickier I think it's you play straight up on the champion especially when you are on the Lower Side Rangers against that you can believe it is the first time we've seen it in the NLCS is Blitz oh yeah easily and what kind of up-to-date to a fart slotland Quinn pic of at least top five reasons we had some games of it over and see if he'll also a couple of one game over opl so a couple of other reason that played botlink win but as far as the Big 5 is the price for bottling is going to be fun to watch what you do a sneaking is always been a player who has been willing to play a lot of things as well as full of Dreams every night was one of the first one of the first to be on this quick right now in North America right now it is a popular pick for himself a lot of players are seeing calendar picking it up starting to play it more I certainly can be a very powerful pick and super excited see how he is going to perform his elected to go electrocute here and we spell book on the Brom capricho stuff to go got buff I know it's one that you've given some some thought and discussion to we're basically at the super cool down a lot lower quicker and your sort of made it through a cycle of Summoners is a bit shorter as well and so you guys going to be the default Summoner of cleanse for Staples let them get away from things like that Ronnie on his back in call Progressive Place yeah I mean you can kind of with the cleanse obviously be the one who always wants to step forward and absorb that in this whole crowd control and then you can cleanse out of that I get back I will be at STP how well he utilizes it obviously feel like spell become become a stubbed in for any hanky Tiffany would go Guardian instead or after dark review sorts of things that can fit very well on your content on Brahm and even some of the top Lane Champions but if you're not being proactive with if you're not actually pretty frequently cycling through those Summoners then I think of value does go down pretty heavily the case so it is going to require some level of aggression to your court Quinn definitely an event the champion and we'll see if I can get out of this one of course not the most people of Champions absolutely can get away if you open a little bit but not always take a selfie little BTUs I do and so we'll see how that lane pressure kind of goes right now going to be that red leaves on the bottom side of me and I have a red leaking top ten Liquors will be a little bit late to Lane yeah it's amazing to see how the Sounders match up obviously sneaky is taking barrier a little bit more kind of combat Focus their on the Quinn and another has been a lot of talk about how much help we were going to see are there is no teleported us here there's one teleport on the Marksman so nothing too too crazy obviously partly that is due to the champion to the game and just head up there in a maybe Jensen would take BP again for going up against Zoe and said Juanita you do not having that cleanse would be pretty dangerous and I will watch out for all this then right now be balling being cut back and forth little tree looks like first for the sea Knight Squad ects I'm walking back as a result they know the next to his little too and watch out for Vault + Brown few that could be a 1/4 black right away. They're coming to get his Mark 5 more tax you always going to feel really good and and the important part is we just like to talk about so often is that 75 range that you get at for bounties of getting that stacked up pretty quickly as it's so so important no team fighting it in the game on at 500 range Marksman can be very difficult especially with all this engage we kind of talked about some things that stick he's going to be having to deal with obviously blabber will as well so it's always going to feels good to get off to an early start there the case right now gold 100 lead of Cloud 9 is here leaked of for the show gas comes around we're going to get a quick steel on the topside Scruggs as well and I feel pretty nice is licorice is forming under his and they're only holding up okay in the match up so as you mentioned you thought it was a bit Mundo favored and we'll watch them time goes on and we have to deal with the one you want later on but look at everything else I want to see in her step back up if you're suggesting on a high-profile championships has no e Jensen on Hulu we have seen those cameras make big plays but not that typical hard carry Champion looking at have still been pouring fairly well for so long in the NLCS when people talk about middling is ferritin and it's Jensen and those are the two guys that everyone points do those the two guys that everyone thinks are the two it really looks like they had to dominating for so long and I think it's much more wide-open these eyes have not been the clear one into a lot of people have been talking about power at fuel for example and how well he is been performing and really going to reassert that dominance shows they are still do with top-level player than that how they can perform at that super high-level net something if you're going to be able to do a bit of last week on with his talent performance which was probably I wonder if it's not his best game of the split yeah and of course more of that is what the fans want to see her cuz I was here can't feels very cleanly I'm going to get one little small chicken pretend old is Drake going to try to stop at nothing but just for sale groups might with a Scuttle spawning on this side of the map so that should give him priority with his boss Lane pushing Midland pushing to be a very very easy Scuttle Inn in Greek is even going to bother actually die trying to kontest for that so nice little afraid there for bladder in the pressure does end up resulting in in something might have been stocked as well so I thought I'd wait for going back to work and bottom side right now not singing farmlead or what does the Elijah just yes I want to paint them agreed that late route does Hertz Azle they say like yeah still a one-trait there by sneaky really nice sites that back to him very early Dragon I getting this potion Dragon free 6 minutes good feels so nice for that lady pay for them really will give them an advantage of their trying to set up the free six dive onto mood of your decisions level 6 authorization to be hard for licorice you would get to come this way but has no way of dealing with the TV back in 10 seconds is very big do for liquor she's not going to lose nearly as much the Canon is actually taking so many shots that he will lose that minion maybe a couple more but he's going to pick up most of the six. so still a nice proactive play there from TSM but licorice definitely not losing them that much and will be pretty happy about how he actually perform this as well set up from CSF trying to get that dive down for licorice prefix re kanken quite a couple shots there but no then got to stuff a coffin and maybe should have picked a couple more shots before actually treated me aggro it felt like yeah I there it should have been on hanser from the start that he tries to flash out or Gretchen take more shots with his passive and and have waited till he was lower but it was a little bit halfway and he dropped a growth then traded away and definitely agreed it could have been played it better it was very nicely done there from Licorice and as a result is not going to be too behind whatsoever you know what I'm talking about that match up a little bit it is kind of pill got that gets to push early on but especially when you're looking at this on the map is Flavor was spotted on that Wards so hot there should be aware of this you know something we're Moodle built so easily into Mr anytime I'm playing Ludo and there's three magic damage dealers on the top side feels like a very easy games in early because sidhwani
strongest strategies to maybe they just need some more time and it will see them coming to their own this week's currently they are at 4 and 4 in the middle of the standings and would not lock want to drop a game here against optic because there's been a big rush tier towards the top of the standings and they still have a shot at shooting up right there and you're seeing DSM can learn some lessons from earlier the Talon away from power of evil he's a lot of funneling as well as sell funnel which is mid Smite but with a normal jugular they'll be played by Acadian town of the champion for that kind of strategy how to give me the news very standard tried-and-true red side band has not done a lot of different things they played standard self veraflox in very early funnily enough that there is song was playing during the break so it's kind of interesting and either way maybe their influence I got a heavily fix championthe record combo never mind which is more unique to facing off the gaming right it's one of these I tried that we seen recently midliners takings to my starting Raptor so you get an early level two and then our farming your way through the game with a big experience laid with Champions like a stock Echo Talon so there are many other option to Galveston Port of AOE you can do it with a mid lane champion and Bobby was always been a guy to cry no Smite or any sort of alternate strategies to get him or his team and Edge and I'll try once again off the gaming had a lackluster spring split and it's been a fast start this summer as well but it's built more games to play they can keep agency 9 to make that run towards the flask without the only two games behindplayoff spot as well if they can make the Run they've got 10 games counting this one to do it and they're going to hope they can make this one happen or sage in and pretty soon as well as a big probably expected Mundo for TOEFL here until I got the game play Corelli on hoping that maybe I'm actually plays into otherwise they'll want to grab those soon as they can honestly without that wants to run before we haven't talked about him a lot recently as it has been a huge amount of story around TSM hauntzer at the very good are Carey performance and we also even as of recently seen it in the bottom light so I got her like I'm Earl and something for TSN to work around right Global from the top they already have Tom Kent Global there from Missy the bottomlands been one of his most played Champions throughout his entire careerMobility here for GSM early on on the opposite side optic of course looking at those power fix they have the Kindred for Acadian and that guy isn't it is a jungler who likes to play carry a chance to invade a lot the maybe he'll be able to get it done here video snitching on the end that if there's a tank support for you with the kids it makes a lot easier for getting Vision on the bottom half the map and that is also true for themselves so that they have a pretty good for Relief Aid of the draft going already are set up to kind of play a good style for them to take pill to play in with the orange van right here, behold it count to pick to the mid lane and I got the one that I expect to do quite well for Optics mid laner of all time in North America is activated his number of trophies anyone else on the planet as far as NLCS trophies are concerned that he has been the star and its off the car to win it might just be through that lane and I can't help that happenI hope you never know if you kind of tripping around the side as well maybe it'll happen to sintra off the table no trundle for Greg either there is that Mundo band that they still want to remove some the big dump tanks at dhokla my flight between an interesting one because is the beginning of power of evils career a lot of ice buildup around defeating piercing help to get them blues Oakland or San Jose City Furniture very close together in time when the party of obviously used with a smile very effectively himself and look like they're going to be matched up in the window Cliff had been very good and Academy like way back last can we find some middle actually work I I like throwing things to the wall seeing what sticks thing I do, go to the beat of pain from the Top Lane hopefully your taxes there there's a cinch out done before Greg Laswell self-reflect or I cancel a jongleur convince the weakness of the champion is that you have no escapes usually but if you have a galio a gangplank ultimate and a possible Tom Kent bringing extra member play it maybe this is the top 40 at them to make some early to proactive Place once I get to level 6 is coming in and tries play around their jungler position on the team that has been changed out quite frequently and is always Hot Topic when you're considering their team if I want to take a quick look for their players and their style regions 12 Play what if I was already from him coming to the game now he is 2 out of 13 globally until a pit cover pic for him his second. Victor game of the split wood and Jen on the TV show is going to be all up to him to carry the galley the mid-length Kelly soon as y'all can be very very scary to on to you or two and won the game quiz so yeah I'll wait until later in the game he's also going to want early Mana in a rushing towards the speed upgrade for his huge trying to help out with that positioning as well so you love trying out new things he had the crazy Cinderella to be just fine klepto Victor into a melee matchup to scale up quickly yeah he's going to have a lot of opportunity to get those Auto attacks off to frock the klepto go for acute on a Galea whenever he moves up for the passive smash AOE damage should be able to get some rewards off of him and pink birdie over Bjergsen arguably the best galio skin if you disagree you're probably wrong and TSM does Fanning out to start things out optic doing the same school wait to see is that we get us in TSM are now two wins behind the first-place hundred thieves one window bring the little bit closer either way that would definitely their fate is in their hand TSM a poor showing for their standards and spring only at 56th exit in playoffs their worst ever want to make that better this time around and wait and klepto bag of gold yeah getting a slice out of gold off the first interaction here for power of evil this may bode well I mean the main goal is you want to fund your upgrades of your hextech or as early as possible and now it's going to get him there at that much quicker like we are going to have a bit of a distance on a Lancer start here for a drink with this is how is this going to be a rush to an early level 2 tank or something off of red I'm going to try and get maybe even a early level 3 possibility these standards Scuttle crab Wards are down so if he does mint Venture into the river early on he will be seen you can see those are the two words are Peter side there for optic that you see both Scuttle crabs interesting move also from Acadian who went red right into the baron wall you just answered prayers to get right over it so he's here for the spawn of this Scuttle crab and let's eat as much fun here or Katie and Fabian Griffin Walker right over there going to be a uncontested Scuttle no chance so of course for snacks before I give you bonus attack range but every individual stack gives you a bit of attack Cuba damage your WNDU so even individual one can matter of the course of time is going to be awesome. Blue buff invades on the boards or not it's still going to be a trade sides of the map here and it does pretty good for optical they want to have dhokla plenty of alone time early on with the Gangplank Jace is very impressive for the early stages the rain did Van do you know what a consonant get harassment off and push Hunter under tree early for a control board and is running has Western jungle in a bit are you going to be able to see him here and is there any much of a collapse mites gets one of the one of them gets stolen away and blast cones out he is not to be found but that was an interesting choice rather hoping to find a collab to pick up kids of that one will not happen I do like the attempt there they were a little bit quicker with the second half of their collapse the thin and Galileo from Midland to cut off that escaped maybe they at least for the flash from Acadian meanwhile on the bottom side looks like this then is fine with them anyway pushing towards them on the various and he's csing okay to be taken that opportunity didn't cost them too much I send it out a couple of minutes but he gets to pick them up right here at a lot closer than this ESV an ulcer painful right now for some that being kleptomancy on is this Victor slightly mashed by the gangway other side of the Jungle rating that driver Loft it could be exhausted as well the flash to give it more he's going to be chopped up no problem for the back end credit follow through there is almost no way out for not going to bring the flash proofed the goals go over to Richard receive Greg with multiple early bucior TSM their criticized for being slow and lethargic yet now proactive make the first couple of moves for themselves and are rewarded with some early Gold Hill on to big is going to go over and take another look at it now almost backed off their you know Arabic Camaro and big after this lowland is but they walked right back in his he was happy to finish up the stacks his first act in time out so he's able to get the last one was raised as well with the way it's going it's the disastrous for us because he also has a teepee both of them do you have two peas in the minion wave is actually just outside of turret range so it's not that big of a deal controller the fur optic means if it'll be a little bit more of a frog. Your 40s Batman going to go for them lay here to pick that one up Michigan down there maybe earlier with the top 10 she could try and threaten not being away the Scuttle crab from a far range but I know it's a bit too dangerous to fight over that one you do want to deny the marks to Kindred but you don't want to lose your life over here is another replay of dope for the all-in jumped in with the mail a cat's the Slowdown nice move it there with the auto attack and then he even though they both went early at the auto off of Power okay 300 goldleaf now CSM the first Blood of course making that change happened here for see if there was the toppling to right now at Oakland not pulling Hunter all of that hard and now a level 6 Gangplank can a factor not quite strongly also send estimate of game can be written as well as one V3 old he is. He's going too fast you can play there from Joe Clyde ice Greg flash he's in with inside out until it has not come right back under the turret and give that kill over to Katie and as you said not only to get the mark he gets the kill money onto the Kindred which is going to be very big for him early on already has a large to get lead in the jungle over great because Greg has been throwing out gank left and right through a lot of moving around the map and akkadian has been hard farming the jungle there on the Kindred so even though it to another early move from DSM and they're being super-active on the map cross that plays left and right counter kill their for optic they got honestly more back out of that county park with the exercise as well because that was a blast of Jefferson and Greg force it plus giving over the mark now maybe lots of wave is kiwi shoved it in either way nice hair back and forth I quit klepto track on both sides if I can inspect my playlist yeah I immediately have nothing I so we're done and you're fired fired I am one of the worst investigators of all time and that is unlucky that's okay we're back in the bathroom I found out all right back on track
some difficulties in adjusting and it showed up in their score you know a lot of their losses have been some devastating losses whereas still they you're going especially Rift Rivals were looked at Astro's makers best team for sure if the truck is representative they have not had the consistency though and now even though Cloud 9 are coming at 2 and 6 they are still very top of phone is dead do they put decongestant back in those It Go ourselves into Champs like I always like to to leak details from a pregame shot in the lobby because he wants the countdown to shut up that shows amazing if you didn't see it was talking about race that could have been an old lady being one of them and let me go in first pick be in Kindred Moses bands a very successful year time around we do have the Zoe as well as cilia and those last two spots for blue and red Sparrow the kindred's the one that got Brew Premier jungler right nowbecause not only just get to scale very well with Marcus you know he wants to get going to add two tons of damage as well as ranged the champion but early game is also powerful is looking and choosing commercial song as you don't make mistakes like bass backing into people will see if they're able to keep track of the marked as well as look for some of that pressure always know you're going to be able to trade the other high do Champions you mentioned in champ select all of our last game for Ghana with the black shield as well as the finding potential for picking Champions off and has gone through the roof is my expired Dayton Heracross it's been one of his absolutely long-term best Champions xmithie definitely really great on the ground. As well if it gets even to this is still pretty flexible keep in mind thatMorgan has a farming bot later on sneak peeks at the Port is pretty rough deal with almost everybody played are swaying to be flexible between Denton and sneaky do I do expect it to be very annoying primarily played as a support now for people huge harassment with the darkwind Inland still has a very annoying fear that you can just pull off practically a terror to frost your after shocked very good for the kids actually in the bottomlands yet often do you go if you feel wanted and the other one's going to try and get off the damage and have to be so kind of close to fear one of them was trying to focus with the other but after shot gives you so many flat resistances it's actually in Spain for those two5-second yep you get about the math on the gold value about two pairs of gold value cuz it's just not worth it a certain point you the way it's very good now Jen has been locked in for doublelift in the bottom line this has been one of his actually I think that's typical double of champion hard during mechanical out play 1029 kind of guy he has been exceptionally good Anjin specifically he had some kind of obvious affinity for the stamping I think it's going to be a very good look for him going to be good at keeping him alive as well so I do he's a pretty good look repeal a lot of comfortable champion bull a one of his nose when do Champions board after raw eggs make a paper dragon Saint Augustine for me double of his gym as well and the combination of these to write not only are these races for those who has a lot of children and we've seen themwho plays here in the North American LCS no Landing bindings on different things like that resulting in kills 14 liquid so how fast do you get with people building The Storm razor go all this extra boost me that he'd be able to build into crit so how quickly he can move around when he's able to prosthesis V bucks yeah it does make a very mobile Marksman even though people look at it dumps fuel or gasoline spilled into a sweat it just runs he is real Swift. So fast by the way the best YouTube series of all time is game adults as well as a fast on YouTube full crit Poe type beat Jen it's actually amazing great editing as well and I understand that you would love to play thank the top limit orders received nerve after the Murph after nerve and they stillthe very best tank I find that interesting but that is what they go for they may not consider him the very best tank saved the most reliable initiation Rite his ultimate is one theater that you can't deny me to come back here the first one was scheduling for Clutch Gaming workouts at the ultimate I mean how much they have the nerve to champion before you you're like I'm not willing to put up with this guy in exchange for this amazing team by ultimate because typically it's been in his ultimate obviously very long-range huge area of effect for crowd control combination with a strong lady faceside-by-side the Nerf afterburner for horn and seems to be a very good answer because horn does have multiple Dash that you can interrupt with it said best friends all right so Champion Select is over and if I don't like going to be devil made for cloud Diamond casket over that with Oriana and sways going to be locked in his are too big to be rolled down there sneaky going to be playing at the ladder your project is well known for his Oriana some more standard competition here for being like it honestly this is middle of Springs but you look at this looks like a very Standard Spring split Champions to look for them but a bit of a new looking for Cloud 9 coffee in four Liquors about seeing him play with the battle for the blabber making it any LCSW on Kindred cord with a very strongest gun dealer in League of Legend champions for him and I think it's a worthy choice right here going to be a fun one to watch for Cloud 9 have a lot of ground to make up their cool games behind a spot in the playoffs with 10 to play big makeup distance and CloudI'm having to face Team Liquid going to be a hard one to gain ground on cloud nine story here of their road to playoffs for them to try and qualify to Worlds it's an exciting what this is a team that went back when they had high on this roster were able to make the miracle run and actually qualify for worlds and then play pretty well as far as the tournament went away your it does look up rewards in this in bed by the way isn't going to have anyone collapse on him but we do get a little bit of exchange of vision here for the supportshow do I choose kind of expand out 5-man Squad and then we make sure there's no deep invades couple of cricket worst rated places in that sort of dragon area bladder gets first damage and then Smith the heels up Lily all of it going to be able to start the W no problem there for Smithy what is it into Kendra matchup that is why the Grog us is actually quite highly prized even though Kindred is so strong right now and knock backs are very effective against this Champion obviously the ultimate from Kindred puts down his own that your team is going to try and stay on and go against the will try and knock you off with the bear and a very well play dragas can make a kindred look like a fool however that requires very good play and accurate scale shots from the gragas that's true so well it is a counter it requires good play to execute on that counter the other part of the cow is also in the early game Bodyslam flash is very good at closing the distance on Kendra Turley and a large part of Kindred advantage in early tools is because of the rain and try to dodge with your dancing arrows so we'll see hear about the match up because kids you can also a farm that broadcast if everything is the left bar on us trade from gen from right there walking up as well to put down his soldiers and we're going to have much better Auto attack than a year does blabber pretty convenient for a staff right there gets it on the top side of his already heading up there on the Kindred so one so far right now but back to camp now on the Rafters so I got to be a very heavy farming route not even looking for any aggression the early game definitely do not want to have a kindred especially with Red Bluff find you at a camp and some of the office right now Zanesville and sneaky only at 60 at the first two waves that was an old lady great job with that bush portal Mage hard to Auto Tech minions under Taurus well is there mechanic mobile service kit for Dublin and with sticky back in the lineup he's actually quite a lot of the Mages like you're talkin about the Morgana this is one of the things where he spent a long time for Cloud 9 on the academy froster yet to CS that weighs doublelift anole doing good job pushing them in again with their more combo that you mentioned being so comfortable for them. Where to get a good Advantage Iowa let's go to the side stage with oblong who checked in with now coach K's and how he felt about chance reflect these guys just got finished speaking with Coach Kane I wanted to pick his brain about that as beer pick he said that they totally expected the Oriana coming from Cloud 9 and pobelter was super confident that he could win that match up Sonic site and see how it plays out back to you guys how could tell me I look with the gate coming into the top size liquids can I make sure that you can't go anywhere either but he's going to be a lot of damage in fact about 300 HP no more charges for him that starts drinking is closest in mediately but weight is pushing towards his throat so he shouldn't have to overextend or anyting biscuits also coming in there as well already traded blows that first thing come through enemies now Timothy is up to one camp in the jungle pathing though couple hundred damage might be worth the camp in the long-term we'll see what happens in back to organize items as he goes of course to put on some Library again on this weekend. That's a lot of curly potential for invade Sears getting us some fairly shallow Vision around the bottom side that will allow Jensen's in this Oriana is your match up to fuel a bit more secure hugging this bottom side of the map going he's got him protection from there cuz again a gragas body slam flash since there's no cleanse on Jensen have to wait a long time we will use your flash to get out of that one and they can very dangerous good reply to buy Olay that you saw him Black Shield before the back half of sneaky Sweeney could land a no-fault for damages get on that one but fell in the bit more equal here and now it got another attempted smithy's turn to come up and of course they pack has all the stuff for the Sun going to put up the pillar as well go for the Chargers going to be stuffed at 8:45. Way home from the top players with 50 able to finish off the kill for themselves and bonus burst blood all going to go over to this gragas now the cars that have the choice between the runic echoes in standard Halls by almost always see runic Echoes built first when you have a lot of burst damage and potential here especially with a closing in on level 6 this could be a very very dangerous gang cure for the next couple of minutes from the dragas with all that extra money that it is the Justice set up here because videos you could see right now licorice find be out playing the backside agreed again is what most people will say right here in fact too close to the Poppy Family Center has been completed for electrician he's able to get it done just with the basic abilities their looks like his Altima was used before the replay actually started so maybe I like a quick cast probably didn't actually very effective now that you can also get a little bit of damage during the week at Goldman from poppy so maybe in fact not quite expecting that one but good play from licorice this rookie of the split last seat last split their 459 has done a lot of work for the team did not fight all the changes they've been going through it all as a player coming in at umich as rookies beginning of the year and overall the only person I do not have an event at all this split which I don't mean it's like a really joke the answer but actually true they've had complete faith in him and he's been largely pretty good throughout this play as well so I think deserving of of all that starting time right now up 24c it's going to impact with a trade of equal gangs is so depressing I'm still sitting at about equal gold here in this game blabber now taking his turn at a Top Lane as soon as I've been had tag team jongleur gates up here this time it's in Cloud 9 favorite movie wanted to the parade.
play skins on the docket 5 and 3 both these records rapper Foxy third-place been in Dripping Springs hundred fuse spinal it's from the last what will happen I didn't see it first place teams going head-to-head right now and we keep on bringing up both of them you don't want to represent North America at World's End this is going to go a long way and get him there a doctor in the air check ridiculous is either Thalia or Zoe whichever one blew through here and that's a simple early pic by the way is the way that hundred season 5 game win 3 came to an end golden Guardians Mickey like legendary I think he was 8 and a lot of focus against are you in the Midland from the jungler as well and pretend that he's willing to give that away because he would rather not deal with our talks Grey's girl. Probably has been the best performing echo-fox player so far this I think I was kind of a 1 V 500 right there but enough for these locking in rakan for aphromoo and we will see if we're going to lock in this vile ones by that leaves well visits can still be a fun game for Kodi saint of coerced or it's going to win for right now for fun do I talk to a lot of the teams they much prefer this Duo because Dad work on so quickly ultimate keep their safe and she actually doesn't have to wake you for lunch food scale out she can have an impact really early on unlike some of the other longer killing fun inside hear Morgana has been another highly prized pick Black Shield incredibly important in the current state of the game size of garlic on a very good dueling overall just definitely not Graves here for taking over a game at the Box going to stay there at Fox Lane Marksman or whatever picture all text and the top winner for the second round of 16 years as going to be going to lock in a Vladimir like at the beginning of the Season 4 for the majors make up a lot of ground right I'll take a dub satterlee going on the Vladimir and it has become one to Stay With Champions you talked about bacteria plus video Spot Lane with like Vladimir + x mid rundown of Atlanta had like the Cody sun tunnel in the mid so I don't know which lane is playing for a funnel midlane with robot land of last last week for a actually had and on the wreck on doing the phone apart from the jungle as well and probably gave an interview afterwards when he talked about certain things that Honda has opened up for them actually he also gave a little anecdote on how to say the name he says and does his name is Andy, try and stick that so many people have taken kind of like High Road pronunciation of on done with guns very pretentious technically would be fun but everyone called him things were going to go ahead and use the words that I his teammates do but FYI because I'm no longer as dumped you know I second phase advance of going away plaque and Soraka removed to be a funneling support jungle mid whatever a wreck on with a real support in the bottom line approach you think marching bands has no solution for all that an accurate assumption and it is probably going to be that supports 10 from the bottom side skin works so well instead in up a lot of pp Combos and he's going to give you more freedom if your photo composition wants to get aggressive and have the duo you know especially like the record if you got his gen ultimate on top of the work on that really strengthens be engaged and fast can a semi blind pick the Gangplank in Ocean cam go top CP should be season answer into it and oh please do this early so a lot of times I caution against taking Top Lane matchups that can be easily swung by jungler Intervention when you're running of no cop is a dead that's why they kind of backed out from the crowd but Darius still have fuel pressure on a gangplank you really have to do interesting thing it turns out that it is photo composition and right here potentially as a sort of the Quasi jungle pick code for the old ones only one running Smite right now I am out the price of his death on the funneling team to the chapel with no escape tools on his own and hard-won between Gangplank trundle things difficult where is ribbon could at least try to get away from the game coming in so I either way hundred thieves and probably thought that's the right choice for this but I am surprised I mean Dairy it does have a lot of your individual power it when the current Day the game however your weakness that you're pointing out for him especially against a trundle the pillar is we have your flask and the pillar to get a lot of mileage not only the kind of Enoch back but as well work done from the Flow by the way dr. Mundo undrafted in this game we are not in yet in this one part of that sort of one of the good pitching dr. Mundo when I was about to Blind a tackle box to come up with their who he is on a Kerry trundle we'll see if that I can support him very well this will be heard their coach talk about who needed a little more help so that he can pop off in these games we ready to go Echo Plus 1st husband receives ready to rock a battle over first place in the North American LCS and we are ready to go into the game top of the standings baby all right we have one sweeper picked up this is what I've been tracking it a lot of the early games here I really like to see at least one person picking up the sweeper usually the jungler so that you can sweep any of these early Wards trying to get in early experience bonus for one of your laners or solo laners are probably make the best use of it cuz they can hit level two on the first wave and our dock is the only guy here on the field right now that does have a sweeper budget that more people on the top side and they might try something a little bit sneaky here as they might pull a pincer movement on Tony's on the one side walk to the other three and a middling support of Reckoning is going to be off when playing a dedicated bottling so just like last time you saw this they are kind of plane to those lengths ocsa switch around back and forth over time but yeah Cody Sun going to play. Mid lane Sia funnel Sia with Ryu in the bottling Vladimir and again I like that some of the teams have settled into this sort of a swap Ryu is a mage player he's been playing Majors for years and years and years he's a great Vladimir put him on the bottom are just put in bottom of that remove those guys can work it out meanwhile Cody son has look by far the best on Markman and he's going to have a lot of extra gold with this but only strategy you want to start on the red-eye and is going to go try and catch those minions so he he does not any of them is used on the first one and just as they get to the turkeys actually going to miss all of the melees yeah and that is 60 Gold straight of lost right there at the XP went solo victory over to and of there and I'll draw. didn't quite learned that affect their butts going to have no problem taking over that part of the Jungle so far though Dry Dock has not kind of jungle juice will help a little and they didn't have it so they know that you taking out this blue quadrant that's why we see the double Cody sun and movement here over to the Scuttle crab they're just going to move on up grab that one and they might be able to go for a buff as well before going back it looks like they're not going through as they want to fully shove in this wave on damontay before they head back to the blue project for some more fun than sitting in the landsraad equating on the way. Is level 3 raid you're going to be there tomorrow or going to be lanced restart Blaze Down The Hammer here early on even though they know he's in the blue quadrant is a pillar and recalling all right you've definitely seen a ton of kill themselves in the camper weigh nothing happened there at least nothing negative happen for them I consider opportunity cost and negative Kobe anyways fully misses the pillar here after taking out the funnel Duo let's go back to a happier time for echo-fox success story where it's really mostly about the Sleepy trouble bubble that Demonte Wayans to set this up right that allows dogs have to walk up a right next to him get this low from the bike and an easy clean up there for tomate a it would have grabbed the first kill is the reaction to the whipping is triangle filler they're going to try zero to inform me when there's a jongleur who's known for being proactive against just back-to-back Gangstar 4 dock in the mid lane gets demerits for the Top Lane Miss but someday on the top side actually still holding on to his Flash and getting away there no teleport so if he goes and he completes its recall he's going to miss out on a lot of minions is funi on the Gangplank once again having a very strong game for himself and he's got the full pressure and afraid of enemy of course you can see the entire plot line stuck under the threat there is no actual jungler so. I can continue to kind of jungle Enfield transfer the jungler out farming the funnel they're smashing it's it's a little bit one-sided here where most people inherently dip like funnel compositions approved for the Anderson if there's a pair of right for contacts that I've used this little drowsy time to dump away I mean that's what they say they should almost always be doing because it has the mobility not level six and use the flash early on so Cody said it has no escapes dark though just on a Warpath here camping for Demonte just like I said in champ select free Zoey picked early this happened to touch of these last week it was a Joey Pick 4 go to Guardian contract also Camp mid and they were able to get the victory here let me look so good for Sunday and then he lost half his help anyway who'd he is just actually fashion this Lane right now he's got about a 7cs lead and shove going in as well as well and what are the changes that we see you running away and setting it up really nice move there from afro mood pop flashes Andre you get this. Channel off flat Amir damage comes through getting a kill back and they really needed area on the map were there because that's where I know it's a hundred thieves bottom side is going to be their focus mean wild are. Still looking here up on the top side booty has been just fooling someday with his grasp Gangplank and the full on Jungle advantage or just that one but yeah this is a huge advantage or maybe he's level five Gangplank is 6 and he's getting experience at all Africa me to help they can spot him now there is no flex is going to get pretty easy top killer on the run and go to join in as well as fight over the Red Bluff. Fight his dogs out but it just everywhere right now though under attack show me a windsor 4700 Alpha scoreboard is on the board and 100 these are not going to take this one like you like to see better in our spring split MVP trying to make them early gameplay if I take antenna going out there as well pillow
2/3 display and there's really not a lot of time for that the ramp up anymore right like if you could you another slow weekend if it's another load to 111 weekend you're not going it's it's kind of a run that car 9 had it in the previous golf give me all the way to everything going your way very well actually in it Academy so I asked as much as kind of a meme is that is that was actually going to replace the city of the bottom of standing are they have been doing a lot of snow with a variety of strategies did actually tail final game as well as be key has won all but one game a well they'll be a truck I have lost all but one game and they had to be stopped ticking off dick is right above them at 2 and 5 in the standing there not maybe a lot of Hope right now. Kind of hoping to get the Raza that works best forbands make a lot of sense Morgana to release her thick diskin slot into into a funnel as well as a kindred on the table in Torrance going to grab that up for himself very strong Carousel jungler weird contact his thoughts in the game their ability to win any of the Jungle matchups in my Kindred is going to be a pretty exciting or for a fan for an after seeing how well you perform in the closet if you're not a stimulant Carey performance this is another champion that really can I take over the game and if paired up with that galio you have even more ability to get aggressive to be invading and sealing way those camps the only way those bounties not to really scale factordo you pop the lenses fight you time got to go to write time there's a 2-second long Nach up couple hundred damaged by background your way now can you use be met a while ago although standard knock that kind of Gleason in their brackets once again picked up here though I believe clutch not pick up the win when they played their frags try to feed up Kendrick it looks pretty good but I'm going to try his hand at this point. Lame is the thing in some of the other reasons actually being play top one of those recent bus actually gave no additional Auto attack range when you pop your W I wish you really did increase if you play up there in the top line no longer and grabbing a bean or whatever your W Auto Trading can be very powerful so I think the more of that and it is a bit of a flex pack that we haven't seen in a with pipe coming in what are now either looking at a funnel or Morgana mid could be a farming work on them if there are still a lot of options that you're thinking that it is something a bit more atypical hereif you're playing some kind of funnel dragons with your jungle years was definitely looking something a little bit not stand a little Cloud 9 the Broncos picked up here to support matchups do you leave pecan to fix a pipe down at the bottom flexible as that might end up being actually that what we're doing the Collegiate championships for LPS started I was talking with JJ and his coach when it was the flightless Academy coach Denver any for the day J's the best like in Flint of course come in earlier on but they do with the super super good fight so the pick up your extra time for JJs Court thing I mean if it's a more standard look at the cost that you say okay well pipe is the four crackers to the Jungle we're going to his is mid and then you pick a marksman you pick whatever you want for licorice they have a real police scanner, but it definitely could be 5 Morgana bought you know could be sneaky or Jensen playing that you could still be downstairs total Market in mid you know if you're looking at a marksman Metals answer to the galleyare we have seen both working and Lucien be fairly effective in the past in that one the one that can be played by either jump in or sneak it was a lot of flexibility here and because you don't know exactly what to expect where everything is going to go, either which does make it more difficult and dropped a lot of men out the Osco the talents talents what's a pretty famous cell phone alert a couple of times throughout retinol play this weekend it's time for the final couple of pics your Dairy Spanaway Heimer vandeweghe Erie for them to fix you with dr. Mundo that could be coming through waiting to see if that is not yet the band Lucien the hover or not to be going to bot Lane for a while to dilution brownies very very strong bottom Lane can bully almost anything. But if you're ever going to see Braun know your sexy butt hole but this is actually just lose your ground fault line heading down there likely going to be the galio mid. Kindred in the jungle and they are saving their counter picks here forplay games with you. You have to round up their roster looking like Mundo top Lanes but with Darius going to already picking up the table one of the son of the truth really strong matchup into it we have something people playing things like to know are there is more of the extreme counter things like the aura can be very very effective if you want to go that route see what the final tickets going to be here if it is go anymore, damn it if it could be a farming Morgana van Champion as well as it's referred her over his shoulder talk about what the match if you might want to have and we have seen things like beer into galio mid lane before but now every time or standard made sneaky LCS it looks like as a tried-and-true will be locked in for yeah it is going to be the sneaky Morgana bought one of those kind of concerns I have here though for the car in my composition is well you do have very good combos at Kung Fu Fighting you're all magic right in that that doesn't allow your phone as itemized is very very efficiently weather protection Kurzweil they were stacking them are actually in this game I forgo full AP galio your Jarvan props go something like Titanic in to pull them are and you just start to build for efficiencies allow most damage come through from Santoni wildturtle because that is really something that caught nine has open themselves up to know Tru physical damage stores here you can argue Pike but I mean it's not going to be the one to kill a full armor like you know Mr stacky Gallia have a fun time for everyone around here is Darvon was going to pick up in the top playing at the matchup against him lined up on your screen right here Cloud9 vs flyquest of these two coaches shake hands and head off stage is to be a fun one to watch before they probably brought sneaky back into the lot of his very first team is summer split his back onto a sort of additional Mage the Morgana grass for him they think he's Best Inn instead of marching bands against him when I can remember and he's on a major anyway it's pretty funny when you sure yeah I was expecting Marksman is that a really ask him what he's playing and what kind of those hypercane Marksman in Academy but we're going to find out how well he is to be able to perform a certainly you know you're at the gas grill if you need to actually Master Heimer whatever in Opera Opera. 50 is more simple as well as a guy who is a scammer he is a guy who is always been there is grinding games than you expect to have put in the time on a picnic bring it to the gas station with you so we are into this one to take ex or your fuel to us the doors penguin pool at level one so it would be to not be drunk Rim regardless was your lane switch instead of playing the Dallas fashion Crystal Lane be competing Chance The Audience by the way you guys are absolutely amazing once again you can load first class tickets to the chance so we can hear you find them he's contractually obligated to say upon to you that's not true it is that is a false you can ask anyone on the is a liar if you find them asking for a Pun It's it comes with it for the price of the ticket nothing no thanks depends on the man is not me there got to be exactly extemporaneous either way we are playing League of Legends here and minions have met in the mid lane which do you think will die first a blue or red minion put your votes in chat hashtag blue dye hashtag red dye looking like Redman Towing it close thank you by the way I love you all right we are in the midst one flyquest Wendy minion game so far 3 to 2DS doesn't grab stuff the red buffing if you do on his merry way looking for the kid DeMarcus Cousins going to grab Teresa skull crap going to spawn Jerry soup like crab is the crab man I suck at talking it's really annoying Walter to level up at either at level one trying to actually daken aggressively instead of going for the more traditional to you if you can actually get the tag there from bra and you can just get it right up Enmark on his face and Morgana with a pool at level one really has no way to actually trade back and fight you if that fool is already on cool down so Prince what is neat El temporarily a321 Camp lead at Central knocked down bottom skulls and get the mark as that one that was on Jungle can I keep priming their plane obviously a very experienced very successful job in the players and we did not actually see the match of working out is that well for dhokla despite the fact that Acadian did get him quite a head I'm curious to see how this goes for flame vs. licorice can actually make this pic work and having off camera afterwards you know how good of a pic is jarvinen Segundo and this is another opportunity to kind of see if you actually establish and maintain or come in get any follow-up Azazel no top flash anything but doesn't still down flash as a result there and it didn't cost them really anything so just a little bit of time I walked over toward the bush as santorin is already in its going to be rewarded with a Summoner and see how proactive Tanforan is going to be able to be on this Champion again for Mark's really what you're looking for he did get one of the earliest. Also he already has one and this is just a repeat of the earlier game that we had I was actually Lyra tiling the gragas where he was very slow about the early game did next to make any profit plays quite a lot of time so I want to see is fence Gering going to do a better job in the early and is he going to be out there looking for gangs because Greg it does have a very strong couple early levels in very strong blank potential Define is the Middle Lane in the bottle and come to go back to your normal State apartment for Jensen currently always been an amazing landed in ALCS is very first game notwithstanding otherwise got coming in right there and I'm going to be butting heads with Center are they afraid Smyth's turn red and blue pill is it a farm in this Lane right now I got to say this Lucien Brom is bullying so far today they will go back to pay sometimes try to use that time to reset but if you did Kant was based on a few was actually expecting that both to come through and then actually get them either way I've only will be reset to even though can a mini weight Advantage driver side and then throwing up those hopping into the championship run by this Ward liquor so they tried to finger doesn't know or he wants the Bounty really yeah but yeah she kind of zones away and then able to deny this so I believe we are still stuck with only the one bounty on Kidder that is indeed true not going to get number to just yet and we'll see if it comes through currently the Mark is on the scratches and Jarvis uses flag so you can have to pretend City 4th of last year You Can't Fly Away by local what is flame thinking using your flag offensively or even the last hit they saw that Greg this was there they thought he was over by that Scuttle santorin actually watch down and yeah with your flag do you have to pre flash that your only hope you have to disrespect the fact the flash could be coming and you're only way out is actually flashing preemptively Yap either way I miss play there from Flame bike rackets down musician easy kill this is Auntie MattyB's back to Lane so doesn't miss you terribly much but now other attempt out of the Middle Lane of course he's going to be already down the flashing beside the fact that he has plans for the time you can think he was already learned to just as punch to knock him up immediately after that you have a slow coming in from santorin as well that was honestly just a very well-executed gang Concentra and try to get aggressive now trying to take some of this jungle away for slows azelf are not going to be able to join us here for a buff Steel read over to the Marksman the bottom line bar in the jungle pretty much optimal there Microsoft feel pretty decent start over goalie is the Cloud 9 by 301 more time they know he has cleansing know he does not have flash on flash just as much immediately and actually really intelligent because you fly backwards and then the punch this easy is actually got to go off immediately at the start of the kind of shuffle for lack of a better word instead of at the end so good at all and you know Justin is famous for being so so good at that little kind of mini Dodge 2002 e Polson backwards into the sun
meanwhile similar things for for inspire doing a lot of set up jungle jungle for the playoffs after they after they got their loss and absolutely dominated with a carry-on goes I think he's spots really nicely into the into the new meta and Larson started playing the akali even played the Lucian mid you super aggressive fix self and River are going to have very big shoes to fill coming back into the team into their spots as mid jungle with the opponents that they're now facing meanwhile, unified have been playing together since 2017 or 2016 forget which I would have down to have read it recently but they've been together for a long time and they were the best bottling in the PCF very end of play in stage 4 guardless well with him in the lineup they managed to take top in the group so so pretty impressive stuff Jungle Band Come With Us Part on p.m.Braves really heavily here then you know what the jungle switch up once again for PSG we're not going to see the jungle Echo anymore which they had so much success with in in flames and it probably going to be either the Kindred or the graves for them most likely it with this extra focus on juggling they're trying to pinch inspired act Lionel Benjamin. We'll see what comes out to see if unified and time and can get from the LEC they had so many years later with new teammates in the new lineup and see what can happen to this one Larson a player with a lot of eyes on for me if it's going to be a rogue when I'm looking a lot at jungle meds at in Spartan Larson was the most band Champion against them in playoffs yes he was nervous and I mean they like solution and then they picked it up and has been fantastic with it this does put more pressure on AP jungle do and when did Ali and Lily a band out you expect something like maybe the Evelyn comes through for inspired to come by in a little bit more effectively with a silver Lane Lucian there's a Grey's I was talking about for River I'm surprised they're one of his most successful and most played champions amber necklace might come through here for this one it is the most-played of a top laner Hanabi and it sucks I'm up for a lot of aggression down there if pork is born band you can't easily fit a tank and stack armor that you can do it but waiting to see you now listen to come through might go for the fighter matchup I do think directions favored in that battle of the Hoppers come through what does he actually wants to play go flex around as well so we'll keep our eyes on it they're PSG very heavily indexing in to attack damage thus far with jungle and top committing to it in 1/2 hour early on in there pics means are definitely going to have to get that ap44 tank for the mid lane there's the Evelyn are talking about that's really really easily paired with solution with a little Lily I didn't lie band pretty much the go to there so now maybe we'll see the support pick up or bottom line pick up can they get their hands on for on Summa it is when the siblings we were talking about this before the match came up free but the aggressive land for Hans, where he is either Calista or Draven and they try and play these kill Lanes on bottom side of the map I really like that look from Rogues and since they already showed the early Lucian Sela Lane for themselves this is going to be a a road that comes out hitting very quickly looking to dominate some Lane looking to try and snowball and so it's going to be the center picked up right away putting unified back of that when he played during the TCS playoffs right there but that was a style that came through at 1 and so a lane that can sleep sleep lay back and just survive could work very well against the power of the not callista in most cases usually boys to Winter land that doesn't happen you're doing okay. I think they're Road need to ban tanks as ear syndrome I think would be the two main AP carries for him and and his performance is going to be so critical gear as we kind of talked about so with the extra one here on round two I think it's easily do Google for themselves meanwhile PSG trying to find out some soft wave possibilities for Finn Finn has been singled out as being single greatest point of exploitation exactly 4 for possibly four teams so that's why you know PSU with the early Renekton fig they very clearly are calling out open other calling their shot they want and I'll be to be that carry topside that's that's what he has played at world before and we'll see if they can actually make it, good to see these teams I think building towards their strength again mid jungle a really really big deal here for Rogues on the PFG side Top Lane is where you're looking right especially when backed up by the Evelyn for sure in a question is what goes toppling forfend and turbinectomy I don't think it's Lucien I think it's going to be malphite yeah exactly what I wanted to say I love this week we're like we're calling you out are you going to try and fight me armor looks good here you got a triple McCarver there with Grey's redacted so topside is full attack damage malphite is an amazing pick for Finn and for the team composition that they are facing the compound that engage with the rakan as well so Road actually coming out of this one looking really pretty honestly and play of the summer split + never came out you have to believe you know the champion pretty well at this point in time but cool to see him a new or you know we found may be rediscovered with lineups are in Frontline still expecting to be the farming Champion down there for you to find that I will keep that asterisk up as a possibility and we'll see how these teams can go final comments come through for the coaches and wrote I think expectations are on that they can turn around for the LEC mad lion had a rough road during play and you can't help but feel some of that weight on your shoulders then okay we will pick up where they left off do or a square road we can take this one down they won the LED summer split regular season those players first time in Ashley have to leave Got What It Takes and here they made a wave in playing with their substitute players and so everybody is looking at Tankian River coming back into the team now that they've made it to the group stage they're returning to the squad and they need to prove that they still have it and I think they may is going to be an exciting battle down here and I want to see how well these two teams can play in a lot of eyes were on skin as a weekly can you be a problem but is no legal right it's Armour Staffing on mouth white and I want to give credit to Road for scouting a lot of talent here top jungle in mid pretty much all. They're LEC debuts on road the talent scouting Bay put them in a Larson play two games Almost Doesn't Count that team barely even played this is Rogue putting it together from the Polish don't worry we're going to bring you back in let's play some LEC LEC regular season 3 first team qualify for World Cup 2022 for I believe they are and I do like how they took their lakes in playoffs they took the losses and they learn from them and like we are talking about they didn't use those strategies to their own benefits and we're seeing them once again they got the Lucian so let's see what they had to prove with it Larson and inspired the players I want to watch I want to see domination Sports crushed if inspired Larson can put on that same performance here and you heard it from the second best mother in led by text play run the world don't worry Larson right behind you then you've been playing an LEP for a year-and-a-half two years like this is an impressive start to his career is now who's going up on the world stage that we are running pretty soon we're not just going to free Apple about but but I want to see how well the rest of it can convert hunts, obviously a great player we saw him back on the Misfits run a while back he was really good down there is Bates they took SKT 250 eventually made it all the way to the world final that year and & Vander backup in as well I think I ate him he's been around for so very long and then I like to see him back in the station I like that. Everybody there if I gotta everybody gets their moments and now we're on the summoner's rift vs Jeep Allen do they deserve their moment and I want to talk about how to be in the top side this guy always a carry top player this is what I want to see him on you know he made his name with yasso way back in the day but here would concur Renekton they do have the difficulties of going double A D top and jungle into the malphite but you can still focused on that side and try and Punishment try and work off of that strong-side go for the invade take control of the blue puppet Ryan to the guy who broke some of those options during your recall switch it out for offside for Finn you don't need to put your own words down because it's just useless to put effort down there but it does mean that Finn cannot get his own Vision to be at the winds and mercies of how to be in River if they ever do want to gain come down there a hail of blades for callista very much more Lane Focus the only other real alternative would be lethal Tempo look at the Subaru Subaru long can't work this out you got to be kidding me the early that is incredible road with the level 1 planning here they just wait patiently in the side brush hair vendors work on comes out get them after the flash knock up secured Firenze was fear is right out of them here's the hook though answering back inside you know what we get for that first Blood little bit of chunk of HP and Hendricks just get a hit right back up with the posting of course equipment power and honestly it's for PSG in the fact that there is no flash on the rakan but as the lovely coming through the got to push on the way if you got a back off when you sent us and Nautilus right now is doing over there River getting up to the top side and you finish the bottom side of a very similar situation is a squadron so now do you want a fully cleared out your blue quadrant cuz you don't want to spend time out towards topside you don't even look at him until he's level six you know his duty there on the malphite is two lights away. I'm so he does not get into a bad Lane State just keep up in his desk vs. Renekton don't take any crazy trades versus them make use of your passes Shield wait for it to come back up before you go for those risky or CS to try and get the last it's that you're looking for here to ask a little bit on that malphite and look for your levels that open all of the playmaking for rogue to occur on the bottom and midlane they've got yes no flash on rakan but everyone is actually one of the well-known for the die first in everything going to the Jungle playing has roamed up twice for Midland gang the bottom line Bank in the way more than either jungler in this game it feels good for inspired to be able to do a full clear on Evelyn just having his bottom line Bluff the game for himself because all of his Gantz goes in this kalexis bottom Scuttle crab right there and we'll look into the future here because yes this is Hans, and Van Der different multiple gang Sports Midland burning tanks flash punishing him again without the flash returning to bottom and picking up their CS but once they actually settle on by Evelyn is one of the best junglers to go get one of these lanes because you can pull the trigger as Evelyn walk up into the lane you allow work on to jump to you as soon as work on jumps to you you start handling your charm then work on jumps from you honestly opponents that you are hovering by invisible to get the knock of charm combo and then you get a full CC duration charge charm of your own it's inescapable once you get that CC lockdown not anybody that gets locked into an even a semi Tanki Champion like a support Nautilus can get a hundred percent to zero with that and send Evelyn with the invisibility provides that extra jump for work on it makes it a lot easier to pull off VAP coming through right now 900 gold lead to Road. The most money on Larson because you are showing at a cyst multiple ways though it's only a couple hundred gold but obviously for tank doesn't get anything he has almost no notice for a building at the truck and Potions are steel that's not expecting rain
never seems like he's gotten back to his old self a sort of Philly dominant self with an optic gaming was so good before and I don't even really seen that version of him in quite a while but hopefully this would be the time things turn around optic gaming by the way Acadian back in the Rockford Morton has been the host back in he played to order games back and I believe one hole or two in three Flames more orange more loving door there in the top line for optic obviously bring a rotating intake and Auckland now olurum is up there as well I still have yet to settle on a kind of Wichita player is going to work best and maybe they will continue to rotate through them but no dhokla hasn't had the most success early in the LPS I still really looking to prove himselfcoffee table so far off the gaming pretty standard considered Okie pixie could do the Raton band going to remove one of the final option for p o e a very very strong game right now and once I do band Pink I'm Nocturne early pick your cuz mean in a number of things go to sleep easily jump in the bottom line is incredibly versatile and I think that is one of the strengths of it as an early pick up a child can be able to grab it first then I'm going to keep your options open a bit cuz I'm not expecting double at the player though likely to be in the mid lane a four-fold out there or jungle person have to talk to that one right here off the gaming taking their time in the incredibly annoying but lots of other options there as well for the successfully rising and prioritiessplit almost always play as Fort and pretty folk everybody knowing that regard in France today cuz your flag on his house we haven't seen it yet from Optical we have been seeing a lot of that today and it is going to be the bottom Landon and now I think is it going to be a good test for liquid right because we saw them fall short against Heimerdinger get spliced fully prepared for that they didn't really notice early what the play into it how to play around it this is kind of a good barometer for that did you learn something from those referrals games what will your pics be into it are you going to bring out something like a stipper or you going to go for it all in line or really what is the option and how well can you excuse us first non market and pick in the bottom Lane to optic have been happy to stick with funnel a lot of the time dimpling standard ball in the whole way through with arrow in big playing together to new look here at the top or support for the conflict big br40if it is available I'm going to see if they want to pick one for double before this and that's a champion has to be picked up in the Top Lane impact on mood has been shunned support 99% of the time they send the bot Lane is going to be held here for CDL prep want to see what the rest of the graph is going to cut shapes out into this kind of bushes off ticket the draft for aggressive top laner and because dhokla has not been a guy to really play that I can kind of make it a little bit it's called Moodle masses of the very well into Orangeburg Deadpool with his Auto Plaza actually played this season I'm even looking at alarm he has to earn games before the six games have been or the other two were Mundo for off it right now if you're going to just say okay well I guess I play Warren into Mundo well that's a very good for your factious it happened to match up and not honestly in the draft like this kind of praying on the champions tour some of the weaknessesit really does kind of have in draft and then why was the akkadian going back to his sort of more natural style as well he had threesome jail games but now on graves he was going to be more assertive for morning to damage early pressure I can get move not to be funneling with this Champion we can still run Smite until funnel but sorry this game we are expecting a wacky Lago Vista 400 thieves a true problem putting by was the one getting funneled there going to be a raise also just bring a consistent physical damage source is going to be nice when you already have two magic damage dealers on the table against of shen and a moon do you want to be able to diversify there a little bit before some more difficult choicesgalio be taken away and think so anyway the galio a tells me they think it is going to be the jungle and kind of taking away Galley was an option for Beltre have any way Kaiser from doublelist at work is most preferred Marksman in that bottom Lane and waiting to see her as an answer to 2 - are cuz that is something that I feel is quite effective against it but we have not yet really seen it pop up here oh maybe double spring off this time around I think it's interesting with the way they've done their band pics before it is fully until the agenda lorm it's so far away that gallon of Eastwick me to Atlantic right here so how to make the blind read expecting it to me to go to the vet and now it's time to make their fix for their last couple of things have to change a little bit more pobelter though right like he has been playing mostly irelia for irelia games you bought it out of her problems as well yeah and it has been quite a bit so you're taking thoseon the irelia you do have to find you another middling Pixies comfortable and he has played the galio and he also the other two games but going to be something new and Jarvan top the lock in here for dhokla I don't definitely know that much for some money but it's got to be something to watch for SSI preferential early on I would say to the Jarvan but she doesn't have the best scaling and it certainly me to answer to take over later using that kind of freaked it passes over from Jarvan kind of people out with your cue and if you want to build aggressively into something like a lot of driving like to go on Titanic rush but they can't what's an executioner people often do grad do 10 dual up fairly well against that Mundo AO plays it safely you can get in the farm get the items that are really do try to become more effective jungle anyway it looks like I'm probably going to still move Lagoon can also be a thing it's in the day has no hard I don't know what that might be a big brain right here lots of wrinkles in it found it out either way it's going to be facing up against one as we've got a new look here is power of evil playing at Shiva 14th known for quite a bit not to be so fun looking at it certainly is but it isn't very interesting haven't really seen Jen as kind of the funnel her like that to support in that midline is going to leave in Alistar wrong at Eric Champions like this what you actually does that percentage be so it actually is pretty effective at killing big monsters in the jungle early on so you can help there as far as thing out that Gemma for you to Leah but it will be that Graves for Acadian midi is going to be piloting the support Shannon Hensley in the Middle Lane to really fun a lot of others to leave for pobelter in a triple tank to threats to Leah and the Djinn who are not the most assists in a few Fighters as far as easy to help with MI5 so yeah we'll see how effective they hit really hard to get me wrong but absolutely this can be unreliable stuff to watch for their the skill sets the damage does Paul off optic gaming play something a little more Sanam actually I do stuff you we did switch over to Smite Achilles injury is to be so fun at least a little bit no occasion is on the grave. Jiren is going top will be at home and watch forastero play his first non marshman any any LCS summer split and we are into the game this is very interesting so can I haven't seen Smite Sandra and send it to me if you like someone who's pretty vulnerable if you're actually nope invading your phone in the jungle and I think the way you can like Raptors if they are available what do big things here I think he might be taking Smite I have lead to spike Cannon to Smite the cannon to push away the lot faster and then if you have is Polly a shed combo in the jungle farming the wave is going to crash a lot faster going to lose more minions more experience and I perhaps really not get as much out of it as they would want because messenger is not like at Allen and isn't someone as flexible to move around the map solo again this is just a prediction have not actually see the mites in your bed yet to get through to him or 1/2 and not quite number 3 do you say yes I'm going to get your ass up in that wolfcamp though I believe he cast them while still under Home Guard with the celebrity was giving him a bunch of ability power and he can revive those later on T3 call for some help in some Manner and he can pretty easily kill the wolf Camp by himself or the very very minor leash and have an XP lie to me in a link I think he's actually leaving for power of evil while going bottom line it is this is what I'm I'm thinking he's going to do is actually come over wake up these turrets power of evil starts with Smite I think power of evil is going to be the one to take the experience here a while the timer is it kind of providing this big lead with that Crow storm and the triplets Harrison really clever stuff but I love it I think this is pretty cool unfortunately big did take one little wolf so not hitting straight level to power of evil I will be getting that level 2 right now he's fine ghost gets up I mean I like to see the creativity gas is almost as much fun as they can get a course and even for you you can just kill that 390 damn it, but he's going to go pretty aggressively grabs his own read immediately get bi-fold and blue and no one is near him is going to be taken away because power of evil is faster to level two of our people is going to be kind of contestas wave a little bit better than he otherwise would be able to in this is giving grades bit of free time to steal away some of these pants then we'll see if he's actually cut out because he doesn't know if they're going to Scuttle or straight to blue and then kind of stuffing out where he might be so he wants to take us to stay for a few options they have spotted at Blue is gone even though they look so we were spectator fully respect the discretion better part of valor like if they're coming up first blood in a free red and blue so I think it's definitely the smart play there he could have rested and maybe got an additional snap but risk vs reward is not very good there for them self very far behind if it goes badly was going to go down to the dragon side take away a Scuttle of his own and then he's still going to have that one campus take Tollway and I have an additional Camp kind of on his side of the map to clear because of that so pretty interesting stuff so far from the two teams some new strategies coming out in the new counter responses and you can see I think he actually I heard another track him down so era did go for the E in two tastic huge ass for that part of the day cuz I can watch that if you want to see some more Hiram mechanic but the extra beam-out get the bunch of damage and he's pushing double effect boots for pot if you remember back stubbly baladi days like where was Miss Djinn Ash verisk everyone started going okay originally is doran's blade while I get poked too much okay now it's a long story but now it's food for thought of this is really something that you can do as an answer for the super Super Pho Katy Lane you have to stay around it and sustain long enough to get a preferential because those four posts and stain you so much more in the time that you're in lane then the lifesteal would doran's blade or ordering Shield really could point out the fact that more sustain on this Jen and I think they are similar issue in power I think in a general case that he loves lace is a generic surplus funds were ruined but if you need to play Lenny face and not die out Brighton Landing Faithfully to Oracle when you more games maybe in this matchup but I think it's a fairly intelligent words by deadlift to consider that as long as he's doing it here. Surprised by Hayley Paige distinction couple shots come through most that was Josh by only eating double oven not a minion on the top 10 even though with that for hot start no potions for stun their opponents you know they are getting poked out he is out of health potions completely and he got very heavily into the lifestyle he actually has Legend bloodline as well as over he'll also so really getting all of the lifesteal South Barron. Go shopping get rid of any of them. back to its heard him and maybe got out without the flash hard to say though and he was trying to dodge any potential flag and drag or end of the line coming out there from Grey's to come project essential skills. Side away optic get a Summoner on the flash and they do force of the TP here as well go plus should be able to hold his hand it was actually that they didn't decide actually commit for the flag drag flash because of dhokla hit that knocked up maybe they can actually them flash following get the kill but these are in a hard calls to make and don't actually committing for the TV I think to try to be right back of this one is afraid of Hills first blood do to liquid but that is kind of a killing we seen actually Thalia gently Alta resources combos place in the bottom line I haven't been to get as its final but you set up the SPCA guarantees the fling out of that and that is the burst damage I came out there
they did beat them straight up in week 3 and work out of the first team to do that so I certainly coming off of a strong wind but everyone has had quite a bit of time to prepare and scrim and practice during reprisals and drink that off week for the first look for these two teams on a patch of course 8:15 with the extra balance Michael Pate trucks very very strong and no surprises first band to hear gold Guardian have learned wisdom of the entities which they had learned a week ago but that's where we are here again so people are at least respecting him on it enough to throw those bands his way I will see if he ever does get it and we'll be able to connect be given that opportunity for 4 but this is a couple games now that have been banned against Gastly and of course game on the Champions going to be open tonight for him and you're going to keep that one going in a positive direction they are expected to attend school in the gardens hereexpect a possible if you go to a follow-up or follow really has the one on Markland game on flat Amir I do is mudo here if you are going to wind picked up anyway grabbing little early I think he's one of the safest a guide you can do it on are we going to be sleepy mattress like serious which can be pretty good in the ones you wanted to do but he meant bad matchups effectively with fever and if you're playing safe can work quite well and also need to have that Frontline in combination with Kindred I mean it's going to be kind of about for the damaged coming from the jungle sets that's good about. Existing right now in League of Legends of course of physical damage drunk and a high damage Chapin General one of the really rare things is not decided to physical damage scaling physical damagethey are not good enough as your only physical damage Source if you're playing at tanks at Kendra's certainly can be that if you're getting those Bounty for Leanne often you have a long-range bonus and quite a lot of popping up in Solo Fue and around the world are so this is going to be heavily about you know so you can start your own Rafters of the Talisman get level to immediately go to Lane and trying to be pushing up stealing your opponents Raptors harassing your opponent in the jungle and a couple of cell phone games last week or so or Diana and then whatever one's for it if you're flying through the side of the lane you get you can just stand in line behind the wall like 10 man of her second back from towels because you're technically in the kitchenand yet I feel like I should have seen it online where exactly is going once in awhile to poke some Camp the way but not quite that same through TV one lane you're sitting with those pork and vegetable funneling earlier this week and what are the big things to me that but I'm kind of using to track how successful this is how many of your opponents can't do after taking away far too many pro games of mid Smite where the person take away their own Raptors over and over from their own juggler and then you're not really going fast food and resources that you're getting a bit ahead of your phone as a mid laner you're not using the game you're just making your own jungler weaker and do like the tube and tear of Zen and Graves at the worst matchups I find for Kindred grave just have such high early birthday dude very very effective actually doing Kindred and even post sticks are you often come out first The Great out of your ultimate Zen also another paper and that really makes FRP to challenge for those bouncies very thin case down and kill Kendrick in those early levels so you know a lot really feeling like it focused aroundis playing you have an aggressive mid laner who can push up who can help the challenge for bounties alongside this Kindred you've been out some of the most effective jungle picks against Kindred and you're really saying hey contract needs to get strong this game and have a big impact stick right here from lir fourth Reich it's gotten us very very beginning get pushed off the circle that can damage you kill them off and spend in the past a great Master before and I will follow on I believe it's legal mostly champion in LDS history verus though it is actually a few of these Champions that you have positive interactions against the kindred's Vault Morgana can stand in the middle and time your solo tackles so this that can actually forced others with that goes goes off as the ultimate expires channel the ultimate in the middle of that and try to time your are two for the explosion coming out so there are a lot of those do you have to be careful about we are going to get to see a judge in to rock a bottle and we have been seeing a lot of genderdoes Arie talking about recently with some of the hail of blades interactions with gin and how about factors that can be I have been seeing on life even a lot of stories are plus rapid fire Rush on in for that really powerful at 200% crit on your first Auto can a poking people out it and going for more of an early game power but you can still go for standard cryptology Kendall police ality there certainly are a couple options on the table here for the gym just got a pretty nice I do expect to be hail of blades on his Champion definitely his first Vision pic of the split as well but I'm very sad to see a few new faces that way in Champlin some returning absolutely of course but going to be a very fun want to walk for a self-titled Colin in the Midland For Mickey's very aggressive player a very high risk loving player he can go 10:30 to go 0-10 before his Golden Garden with a 10-0 start for him but I want to watch Formula vs. North Park Lane celebration I believe his first are the split as well certainly again not an unfamiliar face but instead of revolvewait to see how it's going to go for a slice of March and I think that you could say it's it's to North favored in the early games can a fracture counterpick I think that mood dokkan him very easily pulled out his farm well against if the Nar wants to commit to a full split push to help but barring that mudo should be fine to hold on and I think so much for Golden Guardians their success is going to be depended upon this mid jungle Duo getting in the face of it down in bounties on the contract because if you have a talent and a kindred chasing you around your jungle take away all those bouncies Greg is from very behind become very very relying on just your playmate in on the initial engage on the initial ultimate the Cape of watch that as the game plays on but meanwhile if you want to catch the NLCS life head over to Ellie sports.com tickets you can see your faceFrozen Casper's in the flash or you can see that it's still available to buy tickets for as we watch invades throughout the river back and forth as well as a trade their blows everything's fine quick call if I was as does if you were to be hail of blades Forge in the bottom end up going to be kind of exciting new ones there that's worth Nikki is still sitting on that Smite everything else pretty much as expected yeah it's it's only going to be pretty interesting one we haven't as I said really been seeing much Jen at all but really like a super super tank EDM although I think they're real terror Forge in teamfights is going to be dealing with you know swing gragas combo that in and of itself in a boot device and can actually set up for the swing passive pulling into an ever-moving once you get on top of Jen can be very very difficult so you're going to have to seal or low buying space before is Jen for his is Kindred and then really creating some States pay for them a long time looking for Spanish Toronto Raptors and Cavs going to go try to stop him to last it's a small chicken as well make you will not think it level 2 off this camp but still going to be up in XP and money back to be so that is the beginning of a cell phone gaming he'll be going to walls and Raptors again in the near future to able to take away enough that I've been should have the early push me actually end up being the first one to get level 2 I guess so well handled there in the early game you do a little bit of something hot to The Middle on top side cuz obviously the world of was Tulane first he can maybe get a bit more experience there but things are looking pretty good going to go to Five. The bottom side of crap that's going to give him the Mark is it actually was there already looks like there's no real attempt there from here to try to grab that he's kind of been his own jungle and supposed to be an easy fight in the one on one TV the way more trades the mid lane and Nicki fight because of this item sorry I don't have any actual combat pensive Lane Destructor 3 potions that's all he's got but no extra AZ no extra help so kind of react to how difficult it might be also have it does have teleport to get back into labor no contract wants to gank missed you can look for this is far enough back of this is may just be helping a Budget Inn in that is going to be the answer here allow me to push and reset a Mickey got to go back to base and buy up I'm not marketed it's one of the top Gutta Leslie or killed it a little delay of that a little bit more in early game matchup of a kindred versus gragas so much as comes down to 10 you actually what the body slam from Greg can you hop away from that or Flash that because that's when the Moon is beautiful Guardian how much did Apollo actually lose one more time this very well with the silence and keys made for a child as possible was a good Vining there from Jaco contract to pick up with Bill and contracts is always stated to die from that last PowerShot endodontic I was but a small goalie to Golden Guardians themselves episode of Power for the run in California and Elena follow back in there only missing the back half of that wave and there's no rush coming for you play Golden Garden in the round side kind of setback in this one-horse those killed mean definitely is already at BSR which again were expecting to be the Storm movie take my way to campus of the trade you make when you should go for a dive like that on the bottom side by the enemy jungler to come in and take away some of your camps but I mean look once more for this sort of real gang I mean Jaco is is without any Summoners I think at the second kill you wouldn't mean there's no TV on Apollo either and here he is its Vision craft show for Apollo Guardian 301 they got another kill to get the flash out of the following the bottom side is going to be rolling very early on here for Golden Guardians beautiful stuff is the dueling that we are giving a lot of credit to and was good of the end of spring split I got to get a lot of props for considering a pretty high levels Domino's special events one of Naas very best instead of historically best to Elaine Apollo talked about kind of think everyone gets the respect of the great do you open with his contract gangs they are building a legal guardian gang coming in from contracts and and Lyra has really been nowhere to be seen he's level five. Farming fairly well on the gragas but you know Craig has one of the strongest level 3 gangs in the game right you know when you hit that level 3 the body slam Flats you can look for those early play isn't even dare to carrying either or either of those two might be looking at a very different game that's true but sadly there has not been a big gank her in those old days from the year or so ago from being a big first blood king don't quite seem to be around anymore and it actually shows the Night Ranger the bottom side now spotting what can say around because Colin was on the road here in the TV came into way too late to actually answer no kills going back the way of Clutch and Stephen is not really even going to be able to make Mickey Lu's many minions here in the midline is the bounteous The Kills everything going the way of golden Guardians in this early game is it looking like a thing of beauty for them so much pressure has been put on by contracts in teacher considered by many to be a very weak early-game ganking jungler but they know they have it Alan Cumming so fussy to round a flight is going to be bad for them do Summers on the bottom line here and that roof follow up Nikki coming over the wall be able to help finish off lyric before the TVs come in and then have to cancel at 7 but you have to wonder why was that TV not so much earlier right you know that could have been a good 10-15 earlier if you have a chance of running around right behind to level 6 ready to go and attack your back line so maybe some misgivings here for the Clutch Gaming run around the map and picked up a second rotation to chickens here in the top side vs. Mundo match expected for me so if worrilow a great pressure from solo but it hasn't resulted in massive CS leave it hasn't resulted in any kill or a really much dirt damage either so this is kind of just being relatively stable and on the bottom side of the map your + 30 cs56 236 who killed princess like ahead that now even without getting help you can see clutch is just basically don't off the minions completely rough times ahead of horses very harassed face filled out of map on this rock of the three points in a silent so kind of spread out from here but it's going to be a very original sirocco's we didn't get to see him bring up very much last split but a lot of work into the the new Soraka Inya Maxon Lane in had a lot of sweets of a lot of wind but that one but I need to be pushed down is not Skating Gold without attacking it and
it looks good against you two thoughts are with wolf and already we're seeing a high meeting a band something you just have to take away from these European Squad because every single one of the lights are we going to see a man from The Fanatic side then because StarTalk looks very good on this Champion it's super strong right now and he can do and to overall a trip travel do twins run kid in Jungle both those wins playing with them there is that Kindred and they are not allowed in this game values most heavily asked me to drop surely will it last available earlier in the day they did find a way into the HR because we have had so much talk about a charts right and people still haven't had a lot of time to play Sons of counters into the matchup howeverthat emerged before the champion to hit balls was Fiora getting inside is there still have a good time playing the photos again to be sure it was wonders atrox to a different game but either way different stuff out here when he brought the Renekton it was in a s final game he's not respect the game stat off so soon that will be put into the boat landed and you say the capital before you go to Matrix can be flexed as wellNicholas hasn't answered very unique and the reason why I like it so much play a farm-style jungler and you can get to a level six month without getting in the way also if you come through with the charm on to atrox they can you Converse them down even after his old is used if you verse about quick enough the blood why doesn't fill up very much and you can just take him down again so a lot of Spike damage could be important in that matchup I am pretty surprised though that new Xbox One for the dilution as well and is the Swain you do come through here is it seems like they are kind of getting what if that's what they want here for you only get three bands and I think the Heimer knocked on his way bands are all good and if they don't want play suena dump the puck Falls plane is another strategy that Xbox One to playafter the economizer band what I'm surprised by though is be really applicable you start to see the support and dropped off the table right frontal course high-priority very good at the band table if I'm surprised it's tight with no Fanfare way because it's pretty quiet there so many options for his mind to pick his favorite Champion tearing it up with a Swain as well it's just it's an obvious choice of Fanatics away from the right now 6 weeks ago today lock in and they're going to find the rest of their composition again as you talked about we seen a truck going on if it lands plane as well there was a flexible line up a hard bit later he was the final pick up towards half but of course that's why they want to do is loosen + x on the bottom line it could be a loser but it's more likelywho made with a heart support pick the very very end they have a grave and I have an oreion and now it's The Rock has Adrian Fontenot back to the shed in a very similar lineup for the Clayton early today scan and Evelyn is a very powerful, but you can use the plank around and get that engagement times first somebody from 100% to 0 you can chain the TC there and then it will be very lethal I've been looking at control of course that's what you're seeing what these Pappadeaux's Whipple be flying a trois almost in the top like a fairly standard come to Spreckels soccer players playing there on paper rollwhat is pretty good their ability to slip for she's pretty good overall it feels pretty fast across the board for a little bit more focus on the early game play Lena specimens head up with a Lucian kind of want to get that smell like the Lucian and for all about those early game a little bit more emphasis style for Xbox with his very early game Pokemon give you a pretty good out though as far as creeping in through the mid and late game if Altec does have a good game on the Lucian the extra space for him to get around the sides and out play more of the still shot on Fanatics I'd be there way intended out a bit later if we are going to tell Sean to summoner's Rift Europe one game away from claiming the rift Rivals title echo-fox must win if they want toNorth Gregory's Pizza they're running patrols at 3 so alive and Air Force 1 the first inaugural one about 12 months ago you're at my cat the Revenge here today and we'll figure it out in the next hour or so kind of salmon is Red from the players spread out we could be purple heading for the topping as we expect also want to put out he was running grasp of the undying on a truck to see a lot of comment normally on that champion grass though a bit better at fighting against me listen to Lungi let's go over some of the basics Ray Charles cuz even though we've seen him in a bunch of games would be high priority here at Rift rival it's still seem like you need some of the pro players don't have against the champion regardless of your other guy playing it you know if he when he thought that the infernal changed that is the W the one that's going to put that down on the ground it is a very distorted Zone and is a very short distance to both sides that you can try and run to get out of it so you don't get Delta damaged again you don't get sucked back into it and a lot of people have kind of fallen into the Trap of this Amelie running away from aJackson out the long way which is not going to be able to find you an escape pretty early on Xbox player to counter this what you almost always want to do is throw your chain out and immediately go for the long queue cuz if you land a long queue your mini knock up is going to be long enough of a interrupts to keep them in the zone unless they already know stuff out of it and talk about when you look at a truck if you have to stay in that he get past is what I do believe it to get something to eat and just the amount of feeling that you get is based on the amount of physical damage to the lining of your abilities and you can buy now it's only like a debt he just has so much that it becomes almost impossible to take him down to the sweet spots on the accused are the things that you're also going to keep track of and what do near on the reductions going to try and dogs bottomlands guys exchange their from Echo Foxcan you see if course FAMU LCS for any office in Chatsworth supporting North America or Europe and North America respectfully and that one and right now it's lame party in the bottom side play fight again if they're trying to close as well look at the jungle is right now you can see where else to hang around the top side there is a ward in the river that will spot him out there was the potential him going for a meal of top has whippo a suit is dominant over me and already burns the flash that immediately is going to signal both junglers that they're going to have to worry about the top play match of YouTube users there's always kill potential here for the atrox as we said if you're able to get just the one knock up you can keep them in The Inferno stains out and chase him down so he's going to have to play a lot more carefully in this guy really at this part of it I think a farm basically yeah you know a lot of these games so we'll see if you keep that in mind and is able to either out play in the top side if it's a 1 b 2or not they have jar. Cover in a bit more right now. It is covering attic me to get this wave shoved in the rest of the way when he has a bunch of raging to text you and knock them down and try to look for a drink at Ward as well to see what might be slightly in farm but can help ours has taken its first exactly what this to your stack so we talked a little bit about the Evelyn in Grafton received very often to think about it likefirst blood in for fanatic another Trade Center. Acosta run away and if he wants to bottom with his hook comes in Hillside got to run out and that is a great counter take right there for fanatic on Fox committed so hard trying to kill a beautiful sites that is able to dodge the charm which allows him to flashed out of that situation and he doesn't end up losing his life and brox that comes in at the last moment to turn around before that actually shoot that capsized septic you out of. I guess you didn't wait and use the E2 Charmed the cute as a bunch of extra damage of the first hit a bunch more afterwards so first flight as we know she brought to look at the bottling fight not going to do much with that wart in his wife a simple case of getting out laid right there and we're going to take another look at it song starts early they want to pull Channel 8 that's why he goes in order polymorph but again you're not going to have the damage if you don't hit the skills. Part of the cube yeahat and credits at Phoenix as well because the reason why they were able to make this means that they should have had enough damage between them to find that through the killing stop this Noble off to eat but because it fell through. He's not going to be put behind she doesn't have his plan he's going to have to wait for that level 6 mod balls he can make plays happen in the mid lane with rocks and they can look to for the shutdown screengo back on the infernal chain and also whenever you hit your sweet spot on your cues or you cast this spell you lower the cool down on your deathbringer stance is able to finish it off there with elastic Powers auto and follow up on burning solo The Flash of uni and then also getting the solo kill just seems like fanatic with control this early game do you want to prove himself once again we have a game soon as left on Lulu easy target good job there from broxah again visiting the mid lane and making sure that folks solo Lane that leads for fanaticswinning area take a fox actually crazy to say this considering how much of their past season is gone but their bottom Lane is there hope right now I'll take an Adrian the control their first level six year for the Shen is going to maybe be an option for turning around the rest of the map so what was the ultimate on the Adrian the tank a member of the two and then when you have an ID card. Babak the forest Gastonia swept away but this. If it's still happeningRune prison and yeah it's going to be a nice jump Tollway cap stays alive I Believe by Sophie from Puerto kind of messed up the initial dive me a lot of time to kind of turn this in the favor Fox initially while he does go down hotels Tupac was looking to clean up to after that but Cat made the first Rome it so they go for a second tower dive this time around though since the charm Lancer Leon caps dripo decided he's going to take the dog out after that one and in this case you get an assistant feel so you get an extra 50% worth of the gold on it and plus you deny those Minions that were at the turret so even though youoh you're going to die going in that's still a gold Advantage for your team trading 141 in that scenario into actual game wins here you go 800 gold is not insurmountable by any means it's just happen to go to voice so far during birth arrive home again the bottling going to be the area to Adrian down there almost Eagle Farm across these two farming Champions I chunk down those aren't words to take backalright eyes again as we said mentioned we mentioned earlier the level 6 on Chene does open up a possibility of the Evelyn Shen combo dark trying to turn around the top side but as of most of this game that has been
do the maid sizes come around but we see so many marksmen Love For the First Time ultimate double play something other than Paisa three straight so far Rift Rivals 2018 and now a new Champion for him than relying on that when a force flight study for them have gone 0 and 3 on the tournament so far but this would be the upset for all upset for Europe to get fast Tekken game leading the blind pig face the relay the fans are happy for the first man and I can have a repeat at least they won't turn over in the other Rift Rivals available things like you really are for pobelter is upstage Ronnie and trundle but usually the highest in terms of band priority but if you want to get yourself somethingand I mean it hasn't been talked about that much but in fact there's three Gangplank game every single game here for Team Liquid he has look good and some not so good in others as soon as he had that a seven-game people started to jump on them but no one bad game is going to dissuade them from going for that Global going for the damage from stop this game playing over to impact they don't normally canvas they have not been a huge amount of time playing through that talk language it's been one of the biggest criticisms towards flight because when impact was put behind on that game might be to demonstrate a very quickly took control of the rest of the dayI'll see if I can take control to the top and right now to look at the midline is going to be locked in for in it was probably been there best performer at this tournament the Zoe play even though they got pretty blasted in that game he was able to find the pics and he is able to look for the bubbles across the walls and I'm trying to wrap the jungler as well the problem is I feel like you're now asking holdouts to pick up the rough cut my job in the opposite direction in the summer split Rift Rivals and put them to be his stick cirelli a game if it does get locked in here and I don't see a reason to lie right not to be a part of the key is Team Liquid almost always pair the irelia with the said one he fromjungle very quickly there with another male a champion go for the kills with the matchup that's what it's all about trying to get that first damage and just a little bit of Sun is going to go a long way they have obvious of tapes you can move out the way he come back where you came from Sonu blinks out to sleep as late as well they could look very very good place to looking for a bit of a relief pressure as well with trundle of course quite a good fighter in the early game plan get rid of some of that pressure and if I like the one of her greatest strength who wins head up with something that I don't know where it's going to go dance because we haven't seenproficiency off but I mean to be there spice up until Christmas Eve so far been kind to them a beautiful start to bring things around again a very nice when it would be for European I getting rid of bed fit counters to the Moon do in the Top Lane Darius thing as one of them to match upstairs and show me Focus panzones was the top speed of an active things like mold Donna wrong time is really strong support the Cat come to take for the sink I still available and If I could but be bad I'm at you but if you're going to play tank to tank which is likely twice just looking at something like an on-set fine with that and it can actually give themhaven't heard anything back yet or are trying to whittle down on some of the other attack damage by possible threats that could come out from twice because having Mundo ever and always wants to talk about how good it is against magic damage with the extra bonus that he gets for his magic resist and with Heimerdinger usually be played in bottom Lane now that wouldn't leave a lot of extra space for him to come in from the Top Lane so basically it's a bunch of bands from slice and two things that they will just played so far this Split Rock on lower the chance of playing Sia asriel and Vladimir off the table to Kaiser band early in the summer split now with whatever he's going to lock up last year on the roster of course they are a bit different here they have most of shape has been locked into need to stop playing around us to Fort most likely and the pick against dr. Mundosharpen to be graphed you and I'm actually still not certain of us actually Jarvan top I feel like it's not a great-aunt I lose a match up but I believe this was played over in the lck bike on he likes the kind of overly aggressive match has been what do you think about the two of us has to again with a trundle on a job and you have a lot of damage with the job in front of the door so I feel like that that goal is to potentially camping just shut down there was a strategy that you would yesterday also Jarvis did get some but not on the recent fact that were on you a couple of seconds off of the flag early on so we'll see if those come to fruition in the top side but that's about to attack damage threats Force play Not only from the support Pike is actually perfect around a.com the big light pollution from the bottom in for Team Liquid doubleliftI feel like they might be able to go aggressive and we know the SS on the champion it is very possible for him and if he's going to find those advantages it will be using playing on window very effective against many of the SS on his Lucius with the possibility of Brahms done that is actually pretty decently easy to outplay a Pike in the bottom line with the Phantom undertale really being the only ability that's going to concern you when you go forcall in and if he does use that a little bit early then he was we could easily go for a killing killing for them self and that's the debate is possible now in roaming around the map with the Zoey with the job and try to get killed elsewhere because the walk for and I'm excited to see how the jungle is match up because it feels like a whole lot of length that can put pressure on them and if he can get out of going to be excited to hear we are in the game versus Team Liquid the finals of the North American European Rift Rivals of 121 scoreline between the regions so far splice definitely large Underdog that one upset it would be to pick this one up Rhonda the rift want to see how they can dodo my eyes will be on good say because I feel like that you could look for a very early gang up in the top Play No do I make him just let the way pushing just a little bit suicide go from Red Springs to talk and see if they can do I sound level to spike of a job and maybe. Or even get a kill down onto impact actually these two junglers I believed her say he was your first lccs all LCS team jungle for spring what's Mickey was hours so we have a bit of a match up here of the two so this is going to be the important part of this one it is not going to be alright infinite gold lead can't come back from this over hey by kabi double is now a 10 extra goldhe's got a run for his money here in this one felt going to walk back in a bit and find this key Hotel play the queue it doesn't this car stereo player electrical popping as well as a pretty decent trade just for double or I mean for pobelter even trying to get back in the minion range here as a little short cast there on the paddle Stars this is something that many events like to do to a red-ear basically they just use the range Advantage trying his own her away from the farm as much as possible and they consider that because she's quite a lineal champion in the sense that when she was so cute she was in a line and that when she uses her also in another line yeah you can actually kind of Punisher using Yuri she she doesn't have it depends on when I'm out of the tube that Mobility is when did you take geometry okay masks as they call it. Misky yeah that was pretty nice right there no Smite for a Smithy good pick up there for the zone how can I sell E I just say that you so keep your eyes on front of the gametophyte as potential to look for a tub Lane gang is 50 it stealing away the Raptors they often you up for was the top side and there is Toronto heading around the right now just going for Croghan the top to the map of the area surrounding on to the impact could be a corporate pick up my charge a capacitor in the left hand side of my life on the side of splice impact position perfectly just as the minion wave arrived two meanings that although I may get stuck underneath the time I see the flash out an impact on a lot of Team Liquid into spring as well when teams would focus on impact he would constantly absorb the pressure use as little cool Downs as possible and that would allow A Team Liquid to focus on double lift and a bottom side of the map which is where they won most of their games also call me back to that midlane fight their nisky did have a challenging Smite for Zoe I was able to pick that one up with the w before heading over to the Scuttle crab in the river and right now picking up push right back but it is a farm leave so far for double to no lie so that's going to be going pretty well that was one of the preeminent laners in Western League of Legends so far on this one of the audience and a 50w channel then go out to take a lot though he's not as long as well and I felt these really helping actually still friend is giving you the game got a selfie lend a couple hundred so damn good night picking up extra Summoner spells is definitely a valuable tool to have a lot of people are infuriated by this Champion he's also a table right there to even though he didn't plan harassment on Battlestar right through it Missy though this is the matchups still take damage but I'll take a look at their not quite winning these trade in 1/8 c s bleed for this key for that was before that is outlining who made you his sister just helping to push so that his meal and I can either go back to Batesville maybe get a beautiful Vision down you have to keep our eyes on him as well because you can see that it's going to be a lot of moving parts from the side of splice early pressure with the heimendinger in the bot Lane and 50 just want to let him base right now but it keeps getting attacked with a pillow good job saving that we're not going to get turned around but this is a lot of Midland freshman if you did a great job controlling this Lane and of course there's to help me out and keep your eyes on kissing every time a bit of action is happening on the map he's roaming around splice showing up today splice find an early game Advantage they go against the trend of falling behind sofa and Rift Rivals and getting it again Steely liquid is such a huge thing diving right into that brush stopping the back digging up The Kill for the bottom lane and then just ask for a cherry on top for the tape down on the Smithy the trundle it said why do you match up is one of the classic counters that we see but usually the big effectiveness of money over to me there's another look at you seeing finding him in the brush and then oh I hear flashes to get the unbreakable does gets done. So he can't reposition in time there, just moved to the side and nail him in the head with the ranch and then she tries to go for a school impact has
to see how brandini does in the second game he got a lot of flack and his birthday but I thought it was fairly unjustified his team was running funnel he was playing get Nocturne plus a cross with a Zoe rolling up top call you and no helping and I don't think that's a fair test for him so I want to see how he does here I also really like that the fanatic coaching staff of thing it is not fair for Brock type of place to Leah cuz they was the last game of the way this one may be a bully a funnel here from Roxette okay well either by the dress continuing 8 trucks so far left up on the table haven't seen Institute play it just yet from what I'm looking at foot Force many more games be played at Force overtimepeople to play it in the fact that Renekton got slammed by it yes you can say play a difference as well but if people are not confident how to deal with it I think we're not going to be nothing but they dropped it may just become a Pure red side band has a very specific game plan to start so it's not a huge surprise him with a loss of normal first place like a person not feeling of being taken away in Italy as well and he issecrets are one of the best pick forecast in tickets well but there is a possibility of looking for something know we saw actually caps running are the cast in into that as an answer that is an option think there are so many draft picks even a talent that is potentially available here if they want to go for it in living things is Levi going to be the recipient of a funnel once more available if you wants to do it again next to him you don't need the broom can also just be a standard Grace big as we see it leave I definitely a very confident Camille player here to again it does not have to be a funnel I kenges standard aggressive jungle Pick 4 Levi who can get a lot of work done on these type of Champions viable still in phonetics turn to pick up a couple of Champions we know that is though he is not enough pain that I'm going to be playing Just directly in the Middle Lane unlikely funnels and if they want to go on site at 3:10 to go for next daySwain is also left open in this draft pick trade pick 4 for Whipple down a different tank drunk or so if you have a super wanted things very strong base from the first part of the driveway, looking very very powerful each other we can talk into this way now or never move into the pike hook and then I suppose a lot of displacement there a quite a powerful bot Lane and something to Hellsing is extremely comfortable onknock knock I'm very comfortable Champion penalties one last pic look like a band phase and maybe look to the mid laner to handle Zoe or were you in the middle a mouth harp pretty strong also Galley to do it to it was gathered Camilla great dive take pics and always look at Health skills to look at lck but in the West trailer with having some bad March 12th as well but combination like you have to follow up on that engage in what are the pics going to be here for Cody temper brandini I do think that they're going to need still in a lot of consistent damage and this is looking much more like a hundred the more traditional style of game plan you can very easily because he sent here on a marksman how you doing being there for the follow-up in the kids at the DPSAmazing Spider Ohio still available for the potential Camille select a little bit if you can find a good match up there if you want to but I do it you can also just trade them on the phone other tank top flavor so if I get off and play Orange it's a fantastic day for them when they run is Bruce accounts would you need engage but I definitely a fairly stable match up a list the Bentley in the early stages look for other types of cameras if you want to actually go for a soda fasterbut it still is Martin's open I wonder if one of these will leave Top Lane to last to let that Camille still be flexible as unlike it would happen if she is I mean I certainly think it could make sense to give Brandy need that last pic to give them comfort and let their trying to have no more of a marks and pick this day really feel the need to hide that they want to go to craft a composition around does get even that much better. He's been so they had we're going to get the order of the Buddha is good against you or the rebels good against you are and so they're going to be the ones who have even more reliable and Gage but still very low damage so I could Mark sembrat NY post and commensalism play the plane in the bottom leglouder going to walk in the bottomlands first-time tense the next tank in the lineup to go alongside this plane and where is really good at it tank so I think it would be a very sparked matchup I will see if they have a comfort to actually play this I mean this is a tremendous amount of CC on this unit was of hundreds he's definitely a strong crawling things like coffee or from fanatic which is really kind of their preferred play style ish and then another option definitely not as good as a lame-ass everything into the orange but I certainly does allowed to have one more flexibility make Riley's on bought the Alistar and then you can ask your friend, pick the state in Pacific League full frantini but they might have been something there but generally is EPS on the side of fanatic a lot of like poking quick firstCody son that I really think this pic makes sense I mean yes there is a lot of picture on the side of fanatic U have the The Flash top is Billy a bubble trouble fanakapan everything from this is wanting as well and whatsoever you can pull the am at right in the middle of the fight that MF is going to die very quickly so I think it's still much 400 East about them being once we're proactive they must be gigs a fight and started off on there looking at the Big 5 men's moms that are typically enter a v computer like you can get a standard style buildwe'll have to see if they're going to go for that style of a field I know it seems, counterintuitive but the essence Reaver a free bus go to call it actually last long enough that you can full Tamil your I'm at fault then get your auto then have the sm-3 block come out and I have seen it be pretty effective I also was with running out math why is that new infinite I think better for Misfortune than it was before Chris damage was very bad stat for Ultimate Foot Street Evanston vs. very good one bright Hypocrites Kaling you know as far as damage conversion that very high but they can't ignore damage is pretty great so we'll see what the NFL's going to be Cody Sun I think can be safe in the back when he was really looks like Levi though on a high damage 5e expected here in the lineup for under these we are getting ourselves out of the rift and I think we need to see how he's being extremely proactive when you have poor and when you have Camille Galley all these are champions that when you hit Level six you want to be out of the map you want to be making place and constantly looking to be aggressivehere we go a tide score line the group stage 3 + 3 across these Regents fanatic there raining EU LCS Champion tendency for the finalists of the wipe our ranks are these the third best team in NHL the second best year in Europe and Today's Dentist in their lot of nothing else but just want to make sure they were mad at us tweeting from The Misfits account before and they are not at this tournament and that's a good feeling for anything. Here's a follow-up good damage but comes right back outvery calm play there from Levi making sure to not panic and actually hook shot early and I'm missing the hookshot would have been death or Flash either way he's going to get out it does kind of suck to start with the whole one but it's not actually that big of a deal you still can clear reasonably well with the hook shots and in some guys players you do actually see and going over to the rafters in fact we definitely a free okay if I like you're starting to be around to fixing something with it that's fine make it play in the land he was farting in bed earlier that should be no issues at all Brock them into the state of his might leave it in the past always been a lame boy get Squishy Target if you can land if she wants to them and if you do so much damage from today in case against thesepanettone armor level 1 of you still a major so what's the temperature to be pretty interesting to see. It's really about getting a bonus CD for your frock and you can have that bonus a d on your qpath roof on your ultimate in that can be very powerful and into the tree damage that combined with all the text messages because it's against the very cranky last three things costume ages and one of us actually build a bit more durability so as nice trading on a Brandy right here with this early on when I see orange I don't think man this is an insane like I need to carry you know you get on to him he just can't get away from a committal to go get hit by every single CCM to die but I was running 80 carriesI think he can do it pretty quickly in a my concern is less about his damage output in more about can he stay safe against all this dive I could come in here from thematic cuz I really think you practice swing passive you pulling in the center of the team and that's probably going to be lights out there for a weekend once they are stacked on top of them are really going to have to see how well he can position in and how well the rest of the hundred do you pronounce Szechuan he's actively looking for his claim this could be a die very early on and Roxas so durable full HP this could be first blood in 10 seconds from now very easy to set up here to with the hot flash. He can't join they know this 400 feet of his kind of durable and uniform his first item and it said you know it sexy little bit too risky Ruby crystal in the worker Beal is that is the biggest thing I think it's you know that Levi is not up here you hundred percent go for that dive and you can pull it off no with so I was leaving that off but you don't know where he lives and if you go inflat tops and Camille shows up that is probably a double kill 400 be so kind of playing it a little bit more State really good damn it just talked about before he's just a mate on this way and supposed to take a lot of damage combo I can't actually pick up a tuba to kill from the heart of Thieves here as a result if he's trying to grab something like a catalyst into an early Seekers and and try to play it a bit more defensively be probably coming in on east side adjust back for low for both teams youngest rocks in the brush leave I found a spot him out for this one hoping for a ant steals might pop on both sides and that's thanks to be late for our dear you had the bush Cass is going back to base so no no scent in Roscoe Rick actually risking fighting for that believe by now what does a jumper do you want to take that with your visitors at base is not too bad right there leave I have a single camper you again waiting around a bit and key keyless and no Smite on Levi's they know that they actually used on the previous Camp so fanatic is coming down here it's only two members different fanatic clinch first-round so long has not coming so as his is backing laying is sure you put on a 200 hp going to get a look at back of skull shots but pushed out in the bottom like how many fanatic lost it completely backfired, they're losing every single trade whatever happened to Whipple and then Rock say yes to read you trying to stay around and insult to injury he didn't even get this gives up his life again here so that it's just really okay so I was coming down capsules in midlane to meet later is here you can see Brandi if you don't even out why are you still here
I prefer the standard UF Health in the top light and also warmer in their first game did have the one I kind of silly Clapton and death for a trade killed but was desolate Saint Zoe both games did perform very well so start to the event for a guy who is not played on their LCS Squad yet this split in and really make me a taste for himself to become one of their starting players on this one is going to be an exciting game to wash for what kind of conflict in play in what county am going to run through here for it to have it in the van should be no surprise Northern Nocturne but it's the final Dancing this side is sunisa Lee and Elle Kindred also off me to get yesterday one of those Dominic Evans I've seen in quite a long time before they still better than that I mean when you get that many bounties the game becomes just about the kindredall the extra rain so make sense to take it away there and I'm going to use the C-4 that for the most recent talks about actually mid-length my sandwich to Allentown is working and I'm kind of trying to play this is extra style where he has a lot of Pee Wee you can kind of farm both the rapper camp and pushed out Midland and and try to look for that part of play in early and go to jailI already said in the opening speech at you want to play Cindy want to destroy him play who can do both tried and true is never a fair fight here Martin because you don't want to talk Wayne Ashley something that I Hope Academy ran and a lot of things have been using this as a counter to funnel it does give you a lot of very heavy pushed into their own jumbo jumbo four-door fight with the early ultimate that is really trying to take on those marks in early when do is wait for him to go to the jungle and then put to the house really quick and then they call me to get a whole lot of different stuff and I'm very excited to see how it actually works out because you know at Echo Fox having to talk to some of their there they're pretty confident playing into funnel now this is I Think You're the Best Western final teams going to feels that they can't dismantle the strategy and and it's going to be really exciting cities Clash of styles and find out which is definitely one of the most Innovative grab something every team is Express how hard it has been through DraftKings echo-fox because it really have no breasts look like going to do and whether they are being random or they are so ahead of the curve at they have a million + a million if it's ready to go I like the tickets the ladder here they're just ready to go in a whole bunch of things I'm very excited for what will come through on its as it's now the end of this part of the graph phase 220 Allison table to one side and who supports that would it might fly with Tom kendzia Morgan off the table one quick engaged so you can actually jump on today to carry passport if you owe them anything to the table so I really think wakanda destroyed so sore at 3 if uses earlier today or yesterday and how can a gym actually perform on this right you know because this is I think while you can be a very very effective Champion Adrian generally does not engage made engage for the team I think it's fair to say so we'll see how well he should be able to perform Jen Karma as about laying here and this really does as you said, people all in a specially with this sort of the draft if you draft like a brand or whatever it's more flexible but works all the time and it's going to be before they get there probably not going to having too much fun to play against the most horrible length ever have to lean against on the rumble putting Phoenix cop on the Renekton playing the same song what if it if it is going to be reckoned they'd like to fight the case of any ex husband commits like can you kill a question with a question I asked but that is something I want to bring up as an option for MDD take the rumble into a fraction using the office before I want to post that as it as an opportunity as certainly a possibility in a cool little fun fact I just got his actually went Phoenix was in Korea he was playing at the end of the name was erected one-trick so she is going to be comfortable on the pick in the pantheon with his is WB old actually incredibly strong diver a lot of potential to really put Wonder behind but that's the worst farming jugglers in the game if you are not effective with your early Gangsta you become so useless so fast so this really is all early game versus all a game and it can be effective with those first few games drop an elective everyone goes I'm scared it's never a dull game here I know I know I may need yesterday I got a surprise to let you know when we saw some of this someplace to pull off but today might be different when you have a couple weeks now you've seen this phone's back from G2 is not a surprise when they pick it and seems out plenty of time to figure out different answers and testament only language these are feeling pretty safe is Portland Maine from the Vladimir but Papa and wonder most likely will hate advice yep it's probably going to be a no fun zone up there for him he's got the extremely careful of his position because You Can Get Gangsta so repeatedly what are the things do that did surprise me a little bit was maybe you don't want to go over the Zoe but I feel like g2a their most effective bottle is the one with the guy said because person that goes to a really good job of not just being passive farmers and get out on the maps they roam decide Lane the CC the knock of Applied plasma hear from a truck so you can actually jump in you can match Rome's you can count against these these little plays that Doc is going to be gay for that is something that G2 I think does better than any other team with one of them we have to see that like in this game here if garlic is ganking stop playing perks if he's level 6 can try and go up there and set up account if it works if you're starting to get the massive Advantage but if it doesn't well then you might get to know a team from North America getting a 340 to kill splitting up in it looking to actually kind of Rome on his own to look for a counter gang in early in Vape he was spotted on the worthless should be no surprise we are both sides until that minion dropped but it was X be sure he might not get you either way purchase two vehicles not too as well and if it's not going to be had and so right now the jongleur, wasting time is he coming to make sure he's safe as I shut this wave in the one positive hit the teacher if they know where daughter gets home and he's unable to can't you talk Portuguese really aggressively here early on so it's important that can track where the Panthers going and being able to full reset this wave is not normally a luxury you have as a funnel, so I think this is so nice you can actually bounced a wave that means it's going to slow push back to you and in that position even a thought of his missing you can just wait at your annual visit. It's like. According to what restaurant is not having any control at the bottom side there's nothing for him down there be careful stop Waze right now. I'm wasting his time as we got in one camp and see if the Midlands go for a lot show from cell phone to get stop side Scuttle and I'm going to find us a spot just yet so this is not been as paying off Pantheon pick he's trying out the trash to Locked In much either but obviously they're actually kind of sitting with him and you can see perks do is it's not that far ahead in farm of Hootie right now right so they're kind of using what's as the surprise gag and more it's just that we can to be to which is very interesting I do have concern for the Xbox diet is like wealthy great that's working now how long is it going to work for you know like he is this going to work into the nickname is going to work just like him I still feel that Doc is going to have to kind of find his moment to be effective because right now Phoenix is getting slammed in the Top Lane and your kind of throwing away that jungler Advantage maybe you're holding bit even for the top is losing heavily well where is he at you were supposed to get I will see you right now. It does go up to level four but if you could recall out for the atrox is Wonder is going to be safe so at least a couple of cans got taken out and probably going to be a bit too unsafe for you to try to invade the jungle you can see the only Camp. I can take it to his side of the map has been used to lube up otherwise been trying to counter jungle and I some of the fun that might be coming through that is going to be a second important they can go grab for G3 Sports and meanwhile bottom jeans just going to be fairly even like no one should really be dying and I'm just waiting for the champion and where she wants to go next is a Yankee Swap or if you just go back mid keep pushing it out with funi get level 6 on Russell and I don't even know how easy it really is the killing the right like this is actually going warm or in his favor really is a very heavy Lane boy and it makes sense to me to see your the Renekton locked in in combination with Pantheon because well such set up with your son in the pantheon Point click stun you walking down your volume early levels you dye them for that has not been the case in Wonder is going to be 6 likely before document shows up if he shows up so Todd Lane office a bit of a problem for them but at least Midland like you can see who always pushing and he's almost even inform against a funnel Kaiser there was no pants and tops I really want to go in there and kill himself there is something working with the way that played with a penchant for now it's just not there to kill that definitely is not an end in what I always like to do is kind of atom it in Jungle Farm on the Nam Total Team make a pair that against him to the farm of that guy said it looking at it through that lens at a box certainly is doing well now they're trying to push us out there who'd he can actually get a Faceoff I think he does want to reset the shield right there is a place I can print exhaust burn on the one side gate cost and everything that cool down it's only gets worse wants to hit Level 6 I think that's a big thing that I kind of waiting for you can go back to get some of the items plus a little fixing the next oil in the end it's not going to be able to block a lot of that damage turn down slowly but surely who he's going to try to separate one in first year courses fight no TP means no respect his way to go get a lot of it and Dives attempt at a stop sign a lot of first comes down here. Accuses spear not his W-2 start pulls a girl first pasta shop walk by the band The W for the reset seconds for a shot blocked the ultimate so you know it was going to be okay unless you did going to get crit down but a little bit sloppy there from darlock still in nice and ishal play from Xbox here so again. lock the first part. Then used to the W to reset second for a chop block nicely done their front yard off engage here in just go to any proof of purchase find him out he can take a bunch of damage cuz he's also just buying time for the eighth remove down and try not to say trucks is very strong you get this kill a year 20 CS ahead in this Lane so why it's working the middle initial highlighted before you know really stopping Wonder from Taking Over the Top Lane I mean that's Phoenix is alt 4th defensively just for help they're scared actually was always known as a lame boy and this is not the state wonders not playing this very well he is but aatrox is is like almost like a new level of Lane boy this Champion really can absolutely destroy people in the straight up on B1 and the tollway slow on HBC scared and then just keep getting more and more and just kind of match the race from a somewhat aggressive
will win every time I mean I called it from the start they would lose a lot of gays respective winners Avicii met at MSI fanatical one that matchup 221 including a tiebreaker right here and we'll see what happens is a V8 Trucks Band away so I could play that one smart but this is also a guy who is pretty fertile and I wouldn't be surprised to see him no leaning forward living like a kindred even though we haven't seen her bring it out since about to just yet but he hasplay benefit of the Caribbean in the pass it is very strong Nocturne another strong one and you can see the respect ban on that cap Joshua was really good on it at a knocking heading 99% presents rather exactly one game it wasn't anybody got that one first until he's going to flex the jungle met here for Natick exactly is Zoe still open as well wrapped by Pogooh well, I would think to do when when you are facing at the Nocturne you have to be very careful about what the toppling match-up is impact is able to get a fully talk later or something feel like even like a red-necked in very very difficult actually survived the dive against that sort of play style and Lulu here would be enough Joey a truck before yesterday and I'm 14 already bad neighbors on this very very strong pics Aaliyah Aaliyah certainly it is a possibility but we also have to remember that that was one of the only came exactly have significant nerves on this path was nerfed I'm across the board took some hits on most of her abilities of Italy is a very powerful accoutred Matt dubb it is open right away from himI like to hear recently over in the panties Rift Rivals man it sucks cuz we can either way I'm so ashamed Nocturne not a big surprise right there good backline fax it to get protection for devil if he's in play mostly Marksman out some of those counters to it I talked about how you have to be very careful about those Top Lane matchups especially with Nocturne to be thrown in there as well as he could be enough to Darius you could ban out something like the Renekton also can't believe Mundo early on and really leave Mundo and in a relatively Safe 1 V1 and I hope he's not going to be afraid on them by the North duringturn on the fan from being a team that you don't want to deal with it if it's against things about the kid that they do make a big difference between the average person just picking it up in the people who really have put in the games at him after the champion Lucian taken away from Dublin missing in the band Fates certainly is a possibility you do you always have to worry if U R T L picking I figure they become extremely magic damage Focus anytime you do is against heavy magic damage you can becomedosage of the back of car that uses of snow were champion and if you are really hairy brutes are comps like Vladimir coming and I'm not a bit surprised with all day if you can't already be banned I was going to say and I wouldn't mind something like that it has in the past and I do have no concerns for Team Liquid and they're damaged profile will see if it's going to be 10 to 4 physical damage if you drop something like a Jeep make a quite a lot of dancing in fact you can't even go for klepto antenna Farm off the window at the Apollo great hope from this very specific and apparel so it's a good worldtake them down pretty quickly but it's going to be some big fifteen52 Me to the Moon. Offensively Top Lane tier cuz it cost 1 man half the people can get flu text you and how I'm being a potential Austin like her and we know it's really hard if you fall behind with a lot of beer and the Alice are flying into the backline Alistar can actually camp that damage coming from the cast in if you are trying to break down someone like the Zoesaid I always look at competitions like this if you have some concerns for what does it look like if you start to fall behind what does it look like a jungle 3 will not be enough though I do think still might come down to the early came here to shake hands and I know you guys talked about a little bit ago the chance of going through the liquid diet and even though the fanatic Squad is triple Major the only hard tank is supports bent out of spite a big old damaged pipe, for fanatic on someone like 50 why can pack you can see birthday present early lock it and leave her to think on all the way so they can get pretty effective with their gold but it will not be no kind of losing Factor really thereinfant help Mundo who just blasted everything in the grocery fleezus we are on new summoner's Rift and your apartheid two and two in the group States if you win the group stage near the end of the day you get basic counterpick of team in the extended best-of-five that takes place tomorrow to look at a frenetic winners face off at MSI Fanatic in the head in that matchup in here is the chance of rain for North America on 212 to be too so they had the advantage in that pic and Anna with that they got the first pick Nocturne so I was kind of like to look at that and track how effective is a champion going to be no did that it didn't really pay off and on 1606 we can start brushing it properly I think another smart thing about the Capitain specific acetone like knocked and if you're not too scared of his early games by the time he is level 6 you already have it on a castle so I can use that to escaped into that first game I'd also really like to highlight that this is Rune and items that appear for caps he went Fleet footwork resolved so about as effective as you can possibly be as well to doran's Shield start so you saying yes is always early Lane will be poking me will be harassing me completely but with the set-up you have the best possible chance of actually listening through that surviving in the early stages and getting to level 6 where you can start really fight back answer to really take over so it's up sacrificing optimal damage later on but you don't really need that it happens if you get too late game it doesn't matter you're going to be a big threat what is very interesting actually had some kind of decent starts with their want to go to point out his fanatical she still lay their edges the bottom Lane maybe hoping they can lie about where they least in those delay or not approach me to did Lee surrender 7 - come too late as well the following trade comes through and really equal to the approximate already here at level one pretty close though I'm going to be here comes not going to run it back why is Star from Team Liquid in the Midland Landing to sleep that's an easy first and then there were in the tray for ottoman volume level one at the moment I'm not a great soft rains there and you know we've seen this a lot do people not respecting level two male but here it is again to Sleepy bubble trouble setting up Smitty's in position flashes rate in Folsom in accident was no damage coming from him until we both could maybe just kept running away from the store but you actually wanted to get a hit on all lights to see if you could kill him and then doubles get in range and that was a beautiful time for mole a setting that up at level 1 get the double top roof drops the ignited Marksman looking pretty viable gets really difficult and I don't need you got to steal the Cassidy and you don't have any sort of wave clear will try to get back there is no flashes available so if you can get that one of our brains in the shenton walk away from the brush actually text blast to make sure I ain't beat level 2 skill level to Smith like you're a fashion hear that sang you have no flash on SS but horrible knock back from rocks are completely missing everything and therefore tall was just walks away and you can question why does he actually spend that before the flash combos use Rotella time to guarantee it you know doublelift is without Flash from that level one fight so I definitely can poor execution here in the early call was good to go butler named always risky level 2 cassette should have given you a free kill on to the enemy Kaiser but when you can complete the best place using up looking like a fool no unfortunately foolish for fanatic but we are going to take stock back in this game at 11 hundred gold difference we look across the lane three equivalent in the Top Lane despite the first blood is dismissed so pretty good for a cat's got good farm so far at Sea. To get back to land at some point later on as well and that right now just shut up and looking for their possible opportunity to get out of range telephone supercharger to walk away now this is the first time this would receive broadcast Aaliyah and as so far it's not been great first and then missing everything on the bottom side rough start friend what ball is without his pool right now that are pulled out the nicest way back to Lane he has to walk away and he'll back up cuz he is he's coming again yeah they push up too far they're trying to convey them in 50 is behind whoop glad and I'm going to go in for that she had been his cell if you could be feared or perhaps you can always argue isn't worth its a TV for kill SeaWorld Elsa State won their members and it to get tutored Ortiz a ton of damage on it probably will be worth it now but there is some free time by once again look it up loud how do you spell bored looking for the flight but this is a very fast CC fee actually coming in for fanatic and it was returned it to want to text with Brock Lesnar's running from the jungle down to join the team when people do not expect it and turn it around to the egnyte but now that is a good kind of power play to it overall TL certainly come to head in the play but I think it's it's good to see fanatic being proactive and looking for plays after falling behind morphite level 5 Walking Away controlling for the tri birth control it's still there and looks like it's liquid able to sit on top of that
second biopsy come out front when I take with you really are you really as a party with Alistair adorable it's fun to see if he's like really scared of Aurelia okay 10 seconds for Cyanide to get his second ban in those you just joining us were not familiar with Hutchins draft works you can see it on the screen what the picks and Bans are there is another Taco Town Carthage sew-in in race games especially play you have Noble exclusive pick wear it once you pick the champion YouTube can I take it someone to fix Caitlin it's locked out for the team that is inclusive you can never have it take to get Champion the second thing is you actually ban Champion sleeper team right here Alistair Rumble Twisted Fate a ReliaCard this cannot be pasted by either team generally speaking that means you park at them at the enemy team that you target car thing to do if you can't lick our heads we don't really care because I know big Dino skin of our teeth needle another Target have a name. So as I think he likes to straight band thing but in other parts has player so I end it through those players of those strong Mage types that are the champions so yellow star has the first pick any right now I think it is going to be the giant take right here it's all right I should be neutralized by Van I think I should be anemia so I guess I'll be handed over Foley yeah I need a double Majors actually fairly common lineup toy Sandy you a bunch of a tank done with the entrance of movie when you were both available you can have a tank junglers workouts of the pics I don't think for one lane due to any hilarious if they did but I don't think it's going to happen but it isn't so quickly because I was talking with your Eskimo one of the same thing like why was your first pick of me because you wanted the enemy team last pick Nunu and those are both seem to be the common like high pick junglers does tank junglers they fit so well of every line up his breakout control and Game King and his kind of fat and ugly, and fixed and you've been letting the enemy team like pick a very late bfp jungler and not really worrying about the fact that you know you care about getting a human being picked up that buy Kuja it off as well as having the second of the football player repair Canon booms they have two big Tanki guys now in front and have the support in the jungle locked into they have a wealth of Mages or wealth of rain JD I want to support watching us before some pick up a terror to really think is going to pick whatever they want to know Ray J D's have been banned out a shipping taken but for key Misfortune vein those are all available and was immediately stopped up by epic Gaming in in the last time you saw between them and AAA and he was like open Clash of cool but the Dana. Was like hi how they contended pick up really cool to see these lyrics I'll smash out where these bands are not bands you would see for the most part of a North American play oh yes thank you so much Captain Teemo is on duty and for those who watch the North American Qualifiers I'm sorry I am I'm sorry it was late I've been gassy for two days straight Tilly's cuz I have last time they have a freaking Timo and it's bad just because honey badger team oh yeah you know I would do men on him and follow him around the entire game and I'll get yelled at on the Forum I would really but neither of those actually the last serious either and I don't listen to get it for him we see again a chain of flashes down and do not know who this is the ice cream away and killed one person lineup is a great team comp is is Ash most of the teams they have an asteroid shoot across the map hit someone anivia walls and got his faults in the entire team has pushed back and got completely separate it out it's a free Tale As Long Range lineup because Champion like like John I feel like it okay to push you away so you stay safe during doesn't line up to the tops are going through looks like a AAA picking up gragas got Mom with a mage going to pick me up a Nivea so he was the last time I go again on Stone of this time again juggling the same as got new new garages ignite flash through the proper mid over here over here on the other side we got sign it if I juggling with your Mumu mommy is Zealot play Misfortune Misfortune pick twice in a row here and he's on his European teams for the carry choices brand his his brand new to this tournament the great maze price great. He contended an enteric is my purple there was a four-time really going to affect him every time he sees you as well I'll see you guys at the new told him I would go out with the amazing spectacular the teams do get a little bit of time after they finish their that pic to office they change that ruins get a master reset open on some Soca little bit about how the game's going to give us a few minutes to get for that we've got about 40 seconds left field to go this one from the ponds and pick so we've got right now who you looking at 2 I'll be at you now in this one night I I really like your boys lineup I like I found him only seen at work I've never seen it fail so so that they hate Mobility pick across from across than that really cool lineup I ended up letting his absolute zero you know ice arrows in Panay via the crystalling you know if it's really cool even if I from that mean while I mean it's really you know brand is very fiery I'm going to stop at the pump now cuz I'm really Rancho Verde okay but seriously very very a we line up here from fanatic they've got that idea for the team either of those work really well both with and against Carolina he has no other 80 Champions on his team at all and it's from from AAA is really all about dragons and Olivia and has some damage but everyone else on the team has like straight like strong AP damage so so is regardless but that does happen a little bit quieter liking someone who's not going to go to wait a little bit but he said he knows that is awesome again but they have a really want a wheel on a 3 and Vladimir Rush that team fight for their there's there's a little bit of Islam dispersion with brackets but it's not that same level of a real fight but we are not going to the game to the lights that are so the next game AAA fan. Again after 2 minutes all right in here we are so what do you think about this time I finally found the position before going straight down Middletown insoles at fault and not too dissimilar hanging up towards the top area Fanatics jungle at this stage Ellie wrong and they are going to maybe stop moving me so could you buy three year olds get their Vision not your Linux just dropped the one more that he bought in The Fairly aggressive position just by the bush at the race and fantastic still sticking around down by that Palm River area that down some old Glue on all towards the against all authority Blue Area still no real fight scene I don't think we've seen the clairvoyants I'm not Clairvoyant score against all authority on Melton deep are not sure if they really gone aside from it each other yet to hear from play some kannada crossed over towards the the Wizards have the map will be fine. I went to a camp in this brush really on here and say okay if you come too aggressive spiders Golem who did spot you and jump on you and get the drop you got you know a muumuu Sun Terrace Sun in Branson lot of damage output gladimir got the best level and probably what's a good pool if you needed it for that fight but I looks like yep that's not going to get there Golem safely looks like not even going to get much help down there that we go and if you will come to lend Italian not really a hand so much and going to going to push that Golem out pull that Heather. Never get it if you damage output there's a nice little crystalline shot they're going to be fine and you got Caracas was Vladimir up top and a Nivea versus brands of Fire and Ice in the mid I'm going to keep that one played after this tournament is really probably one of the biggest I think they were two major robberies in this tournament and they're in the same group that it is AAA worth of fanatic and it's teal G versus Team Solomid and it was really going to be the major I think rivalry that it really going to be a lot here that that I think the crowds don't really want to see I am in this to the to the giant overtones of any risky you and how good it southeast Asia was that a lot of really cool story lines going on in this tournament and right now it is Fire and Ice and I'm okay with that one right now Anna and Middle St Medina, as I mentioned before and you qualify as playing a very very solid and if your game in that Middle Lane and chew she's going to try not to put some early pressure down there I'm not sure maybe a little bit of fresh at we saw a rat lamia closest play me supposed to turn off his HP remaining in that one Ramallah vastly the jungles or at least a moo moo car in about his regular promise when you do go back home and pick yourself up some boots that's funny that you really do want to get fat people pee on you knew he is one of the best gaming junglers but you can rely on landing at school if I have to get the 152nd cool down cuz you have minutes of of not super super safety and he's back and really give you a giant first appeal if you can give you a full help that's it and then pressure on in Mid going to hurt pretty bad you need to know about two-thirds health unit Minden of you putting up that ice, do some nights damage and it worked pretty well but so far no major gains strides end of the car when it comes off from Tarak going to watch for that jungle do this is to be there as soon as that video is not going for the right going back into his own jungle Denny's in in in in a good place to ski or going to recall back they know that you do as far as I can see the rest of the land so he is safe to recall that was based not let me sell it for that we will fail are getting really really low here in a cell has does still have ignite up and flat ticket first about 300 health so it's going to be pretty close to the Belle cam. PK well. That one sorry that we will pay little dogs that one of them keep getting that one wrong unfortunately but I'm getting pretty welcome to be coming back in about one getting lower and lower and super annoying right now to find out if I level 4 has a philosopher's stone has those two Ward that's a really good for the team to drop one right they're going to spot maybe not right there I'm Ron Kittle or farther down I guess you do staying relevant do in this fight hasn't clairvoyants signal not push it too hard on to Brand looks like I'm going to drop her work is going to get behind so that's honestly make me uneasy when he went in to try and put some fresh ones as well as even money threw up on his truck is waiting on some Minion down and talk me into Yellowstone only 56 Health remaining on well it was a nice aggressive. Matt Kuchar but didn't quite have that damage output, he's still hanging around there though I'm not going to be a little bit I'm not going to be very dangerous for me, as well as he's actually going aggressive that is not a man until we are here in what else can they do so as showing up looks like they're not doing a whole lot there drop by so as once more start with a decent you like an idiot legs so what's going on and then we caught up so apologies there but yeah I play this game with from mistakes where you know Ash turn back around a pipe Misfortune and died when she got away and it was it was pique or we will fail are actually failing and rocking back into that are all but somebody's playing a wonderful game right now
you have 30 seconds of peas to ban Champion so let me get a quick overview how to terminate draft works so the two teams by players per team and you draft the Champions you can see on the screen here there's a list of 576 Champions must build a floaty play League of Legends this is the current live build - orianna orianna is not available but all the rest of champion on the balance changes the Skins all available to use into the way this works if you're playing competitive play in this tournament you can ban out Champions so you can get three bands you can see a collie and left hand side rumble on the other these teams are Banning out shampoo for the other team and end their own team can't play them they're they're not eligible to play in that game all these changes give it up to three you do a new set of band after each team Band 3 Champions going to pick cycle AAA will pick one and it will take two and we'll go 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 is there but the point is you take turns picking your 5 champion and you can see that they are there saying you know I love seeing these targeted vanthe North American Service is known for playing at all he's an incredibly strong Macaulay player and he's a rebel the chain is known to be so strong in the European servers that don't exist barely ready to play in now. Do it. That was that right there so the band got one more thing I going to do with that Rumble going to park at Dan Nunu is it is a very Smuggler and the Twisted Fate the very last dance from epic so if you spell that lets him do a lot of damage to a single Target usually jungle minions and got flash as well just a good summer to spell for positioning it lets you move about a third of the screen wherever you want across the map and it was a very a position based champion from going to push into the location are you see the the early pics of Epic R jahna in vain vain arranged Harry physical damage than Champion dejana a great babysitter and support for physical damage to the shoetotally blocked him if it gives you going as damages well and veins going to really love having that and one of these League of Legends about when you pick a chance will you pick Summoner spells which means the UFC as a player have two of roughly 12 you can pick and no matter what can you have you can cast those spells on on my route to Long Cool Downs that do cool things with flash teleport to you ghost makes you run faster point for bills location on the map look at more of these pics and carpets in early pick as well as very strong Mage pick him but it's very smart made with magic damage and contrast to going to be doing Champion as well as you can pin targets down in a location and then carjacked adjust belt on those guys into a constant cost of damage can we see that they take me to school to Norway a big guy 80 Cari Champion news going to be played out lieWarrick that weather August. We have three flashes on the point out real quick just in case draft so you're picking in the order they joined the game but you can swap your Champions Run at the end so it is that you're working out really well we're dyrus probably will be playing physical Carrie and Dan did actually is the jugular for the team and solves is the Mage player picking up Auntie but you might see some options for example of The clairvoyants Misfortune is nothing about you ever seen played a ranked game Sofitel Define support he's got the clear ones locked in he's going to swap with a yellow star is probably the range carry play for this game and end up going to ruin things going on thereafter a y o t n Out against all authority take that final to fix ons do they have the first one and yellow stop will be taken Soraka so they believe main support against all authority in Yellowstone actually inches laying there just got nothing on me second position actually in the insole of rank you but I know one of them Wicked from SK SF some time to concentrate last year. $100,000 up for grabs top team $50,000 to split amongst your team have the money here on Tuesday Morning giant giant shark bigger than be worth a lot of money and little glass be fixed and now it's irelia to pick upis an age waiver the TM like I could run a little bit Rusty of European lineups kind of like her being in a continent but generally speaking so as a mage player he is one who plays me to leave when he's up there usually plays the Mages so help me with the yellow star into dust mop sweeper entertaining commentary of course talk about swapping Champions put the final pick for epic Gaming West rice is one of those ranged a d players as well I have seen these guys run double damage has great they're going to grab say I'm super happy to see that I was going to be on the same as soon as I go to swap I'm sorry I'm having a family meeting right now this is great. I'm just going to tell you a little bit on the usual team definitely a lot more I guess you know if America what a great Champion for me to watch I see my email as wellrunning around it is like waiting people died to me but we have the garbage find another place to set up runes and masteries and swap they received who's not taking that Soraka entire isn't done soon as I know what you want babe I love watching things you do so many stupid things that are hilarious pussy Glover's back those are going down runs out of the poison Trail and we can catch him he's he's the most hilarious Champion I'm waiting arms around his great Mercy Center devil is going to be staying all support is a fairly well-known blitzcrank player the North American mountain with a tank if you got citizen work to hold that Frontline either got the nice crowd control from and he's going to be pretty safe is going to be here if you look at it again. Until we saw in the European qualifiers Moma playing a very very solid game in the mid lane and I'll just leave this time playing golf this one of those Champion to you always havebe aware of when you think you've escaped without little bit of metal burned all of a sudden your desk and usually three maybe four of you as well if it has lucky because well over on the other side as he said double-a going for the support role this unusually may be playing there a little bit more cranky of that will see West fry something to play with you Bane going to have to come out very very strong on at Barton Lane Foley and Sam Esports you continue running as well as I was able to be played by itself to asking because of the great great battle between honey and Noma kalyana Belton moment here but maybe a little bit less North American players have been adopting the European play style of running a support was arranged very bottom of a maid that usually take a guy up Top Lane and independent European Standard for lifeyou're so they've been doing that for quite some time and it took it up as a reason they going to make a place to realize this is a better position now some carries can take us to Corky's one of those examples of guy who can actually so we'll talk when is chilling be fine if you can actually see double a double Kerri lamp beside actually North American Qualifiers were epic they had bought it at the store. But they also had Corky on top so you can't even those devil But Here We Go the game is up in loading screen here we can see Triple-A their faces on speed right now talking to you about talking with themselves getting the house ready looking at December smells the line up the Skin's all that fun stuff ready to go very soonbut yeah the lineups and I'm looking at this energy here and AAA has a great area that competition it got a name has ultimate they've got a lot of misfortunes ultimate dropping tons of damage out there and you could go to the game his actual I want to see that the blue team the green healthbars AAA let's go guys all right in here we are in the game to be following the yellow star on road warrior Miss Fortune Cookies real quick right now.. Ready for dream happy of yellow star creeping up and rest of the team and you can see I think is right there to drop the word of this Brush review real quick to see just what they want so they don't really see AAA running around just yet we we drop that backed out and I got to get used to keyboard I'm sorry I'm a little bit slow in the commands the first day or so I've been eating name of the anime jungle Andover Way at the top AAA scared actually afraid of getting a new front tire it there their they're take their own Golem right here look at me pretty much safe to have taken over the red Bob and they're going to jump into the brush you and me to go to spawn in 20 seconds of the Nutri monsters was fun then and it looks like a freaking better place to store Patrol this game right now going to take something is wrong come on inside a fully but it was a pretty big bang the really amazingly aggressively out to phone list all this woman that's still hung around and go to st. John's University. Playmore I just don't answer those rates for the first day of it. Take away from against all authority jungle right now the more it's going to help them a little bit later on clouds are going to read to you maybe a little bit dangerous going to go to West rice and they're going to be leaning against the Red Top vein that is not what you want to fight against of your AAA right now so they have a good chance that the sealer of Soraka and they're coming out of his fortune is she going to be okay but already exhaust down as well but I'll take it exhaust to waste a flat that's really good for them right now so that's why I got the good open traffic right here with great position is lost from dunnedin to really expect that fly straight over the top and I couldn't really do so much damage in there probably could have something a little bit interesting about to take off here with all the money will go into Darkness Darkness put me in a little bit of trouble game cell phones at health potion to get into a place like home so that's how I ask for things even in terms of that another Johnny between toenail youngboy really rental from FX really going to set it apart I think it is a release date yet but we still waiting around and he's he's maybe unfortunately I'm not quite sure the aggression of bottom it is pretty strong but the Rockets giant fuel rewards can they still safe inside the trip on most of these guys and airports that way about pretty much safely up and comes out Johnny going to start roaming and this could be us some damage to pull back and look at the dragon see that it's safe and looks like the Christ haven't heard it for now that's it one of the great things about seems you know you think okay we can get in there on to him and he throws you behind you've got to tell her I grow on you and you just have to run away all really Rick yourself in that one officer. So it's a really nice place to go and pick up that sell the Extra Innings rocks and Roots looks like I got me some slot on your nipple buybuybaby dismiss it in Auckland great recipes pushing around Moma right now that's not to work too well for him to take him some time to get back up. So I don't know if I'm going to keep up with this night is a 26 of them out so quickly play the one not freshman on against all authority and there's the aggressive words with qu checking out face check that brush with it with impunity and know that no one is there by about three hundred gold so far globally on the team's they're getting some slight advantage of themselves just ever-so-slightly Brooklyn 670 favor of Yellowstone in baseball 2017 cheat at Red Hook being picked up by White Stripes. Running the game money to avoid any Lincoln Heights holding out knife thought that was super perfect as a great playwright there you plug them back into Tower range for scout fiberglass are in a force I have the flash out so we should be good to go Channel sauce I'm sorry man Gigi salty comes down first one to against all authority
16 years old back at the end of 2018 and the second you're able to have been really good since then I think is one of the all-time greats down the bottom Lane his lame it. As a player I will always give love and respect to the roster for the Curious world I am in love with this is exactly Gadget has been extremely flexible definitely targeting him here because he has played the midget on bottom side the Oriana as well I do think that despite feel playing these Mages and flexing around there for unicorns of Love which was his real standout Champion hard carrying with that combination at the we saw your note Witcher con can be threeengages four teams as well but it's so difficult to draft against unicorns of love because of the new variations that they still throw out here meanwhile we do have some more about the standard bands are the Aleutian solo Lane band taken away as well in the Silas popping up on top against them in the postseason very strong Champion their Oriana by the way is the primary Banda LCL teams put up a unicorn to love because that is actually a flex player there's an interview that Gadget came out to Swain's thing hey this seems really bad back line access or like really bad first so I can just simply play Swain antenna drain tank the entire he was Wyatt Oriana is one else because it goes between those two players drafted of course there's a way out there and only a few that can be bannedChampions the most played by far for Bob the top lights and white up there for touring as well and during definitely has been another one that people been looking at as a possible way to play again TRX so boss taking this stuff very early on means he will have a pretty strong Lane matchup for himself despite it being blind not a lot of great answers into Renekton here so your ex posting on their bottom side the gravity at vera for death in mediately and I even though there been so many champions played by carrier I have really liked him most on the long-range supports the Luxe the Morgana the enchanters for himself so trying to pair one of those with Ash to have a really strong Lane phase for the stuff I could be a pretty good angle to go for sports the mix as well and prosper them but we get to Italy coming through as the prime jungle tic-tac-toe the only other one kind of sitting out there as a as a top for jugular I would say in worldright now but nothing to grab them before the Braves still available for a nonstick jumbo could play here in a little bit suspect at times ever since they transitioned from ending on initiation jungles over to the current head of the carry junglers like going against Evelyn's you do want to have your heavy invade looking for trying to punish her early on as an anesthetic on on this Champion has definitely had some success. As well and see what they want to go with Iran V side answering me ask Jen pick up for Gadget does give you that long-range snare with spin be devastating when you have an Evelynn jungle for yourself you can set her up landfill charm charge for it though and or lava right now and Incredibly successful championturn the play in stage was band against solo at the end of the very first draft and now picked up here for door is not his most played he is really partial the fighters but it could go on for taking a win right here I like putting your maybe we could remember honestly I'm pressing the deaf task have plenty of teeth by damage output yeah I definitely think that you're actually be expecting some top side Focus here already considering the drafts make you play Ring box you're wanting to try and abused that door and pick of the orange but obviously orange is picked for the team value that you bring upgrading items big gold power spice Doors 2 level 14 and the team fight initiation irelia dropping out the table just trying to get rid of the pig Playmakers off a Cho be right there cuz of course I mean unless you really think orange sports going to happen inForever 21 games away from the midline or here now we need to support to be locked up it looks like down there and Pantheon what you're actually going to try and go to to kind of even out their profile here support Pantheon definitely super powerful huge amounts of crowd control Eric set up for drx4 possible picks for setting up this Natalie I've tried has tourmaline influence as well know where Joe V's most played champions in the summer split an onward of the lck playoff they are objectivewhat he played and I think through the pantheon ass and it says I'd personally don't like this one but Alistair they look really good going to be a lot better huge possibilities for team fights if you do you like in the Alistar obviously very well known for combos with Oriana with the Shockwave delivery you can w r to W N & D the icing off the the ball for so little sneaky place for himself as well I do think again though there still is going to be a decent amount of focused towards the top side of the map for unicorns heading into it and bottom side they're going to look at have it somewhere roaming possibilities from the pantheon now possibly yeah still can still can Flex the pantheon in the SEC if they really want to but I do expect it to be Fantastic Fourjungle make a different flop goes back and forth Del Pantheon jungle is very viable well show me right now looking at the cover on set midi played it five times already probably not moving around really big front like he was always going to build a theme second in the mid-to-late lck and higher so yes I think it's going to happen for him but it's a cough that is really built around depth being the only primary Terry meanwhile there are a lot of breath and depressed can get on Siri on the o l socket and I'm really sad actually now that they don't settle I remember they have to delete all ready for Juggle this solo laid come and get it there for theat the auto setting up with Ashley I was as well right cuz I don't think you want to get ink or set that much over all the clothes around them has been somewhat negative of a kind of narrowly. Into the lck finals and got that second seat if if people are expecting any one of those teams are named on the list of things that may falter down here but I think there's a very very good team I'm a big fan of the bot Lane in a big fan of govt as well and they made quarter-final taken down a bunch of stats on the way so I do want to see if unicorns of love kids live up to the reputation and turn a bunch of headsable to do the world's groups are games for this week so much about you know making it into the group stage of world but they don't just want to be here the reason they were so frustrated about not making it into the group stage last time around cuz of the damage that they can do it once they are here so now on the world stage here in the main event want to see them make it happen I've been definitely excited about the play in stage performances especially from Gadget down there on the bottom side of the map so we'll see if they can lock anyone up literally poke from the cross for the week I was going to come through in time we don't have any aggressive word and come across and no really big stabs there is a single Ward from Derek in the bottom River a very similar one from unicorns of love in the top River and that old spot if there's any vertical jungling going on or late invades in about 25 seconds on the clock right there you'll see if they're already in looks like no one's doing much of anything couple of things towards the bottling try brush T-Rex knowing that they should be afraid or not it looks like going to have a three month old ate a leash list topside start for p060 neither top Leonor Watling going to give away with the jungle has started Daft wanted to poke in this one in just crossed half as good because it means like can we were talking about in champ select of of heading towards the pantheon towards the pantheon support year because of the guarantees done whenever you have been digitally jungle you're looking for those point-and-click done to set up your ears that truly effective gay-lussac is going to do when it is full clearance here goes red up into frogs and we'll transition Down Sports at bottom side but look at Anonymous it already going down just move us to buff clear down to read to make sure he can secure these on Evelyn expecting some of those possible in DayZ coming from the Middle East because so much CC possibilities from both of mid and bottom Lanes I don't clear this no worries start on the gym this means they don't know for sure we're on a thick is however the Hotshot comes through reveals that has gone is gone and he's not on chickens or the Grump so he must be on front right now regardless and this is such a strong performance already coming out from Death in Korea who dies in the beginning of Summer they were extremely fond for TRX but they did start to fall off chords and you know Jeff has a back injury that they were talking about a lot so it's really nice to see that being a point of power for this team Edge CS Lee that they fully do unicorns bottom line under the tower trying to force them to miss sies continuous fighting over his ex revision and now I feel sick last out what a wreath on Comedown jumps 123 watlington a really hard time right now for you as well. This is definitely a kingdom here for Dragon X they want to leave Doran up on the top side without any sort of interaction sand for all of these by down onto the bottom half of the map continued renewal of the wards through the red quadrant of unicorns jungle as well will allow these Invaders from the osec continue to find purchase planning that spear was huge chunk and down it and not a second forcing them up into the top half the map where he's able to find the respawn on those fronts so they have a little bit of extra skinny jeans the mountains going to be roughly level 3 spawn of those so good XP and gold picked up right there but already a four to five hundred gold difference for DRX no big rig up in the cross just yet just reporting is items boss taking an early recall it's a good ass intro inflating bike to that one but you can see every single Lane all down the line you got leads for dear X in the early game unicorn so far not standing up and look at this is so lost right now or after the invasion not a lot of opportunities for him the last one remaining would be Jovi midlane but this is a ghost flash set double Mobility Summoner spells for himself to greatly increase the possibilities of navigating through these team fight I do think the extra attention to Mobility for that piece off of really really cute, and allows them know not to have to go for the face rash You're So Soft goes far and flashes not just yet The Flash in action free to use as the ghosts go for the initiation I want to know man then because he still has the flash it's a confidence to go for the chunk with his W setting up yo 6 to finish it flash burn their from Italy to find that kill as well and dragon X are rushing the early game Kingdom 4dx so far it's just across the board doing a whole lot better for three calls come through has a full fiendish codex for po sick you would love to see that recall on middle he is Rich with the rebs might vary as well not as thick as she still clearing his truck before his first back but this is rough stuff CC at the bottom light he's run faster betrayed right there is no man's back from him and now we can see it bought Lanes in the bottom corner that burned the flash out of Santa's you have a good night there from Carrie as well used in the edge
players we have seen make huge plays you think back to the last time that power of evil and ignorant worlds they took SKT to five games the quarterfinals and a very very narrow series are the ftt went on to win the championship in about 1 if I recall correctly and regardless and exciting match and top Esports starting out the world championship group stage course number to team out of the LCS back-to-back finals for fly Quest trophy in the summer split they also won the mid-season, it was pretty much an LPL dominating a fair and now I get to see who can make this one happen again is bands come through pretty quickly and this is a mediately here because there was a pretty big a difference between the players that I talk to you from group stage teams being surprised that the meta that evolved in play in being so much focus on scaling and on team fights and a lot more from this Grimm's from these groups 18I've been on Top Lane carries on snowballing and top-view sports are definitely positioned well to do that but with 369 but even so they been out the shed that do locaton blind for flyquest in playoffs he was willing to play tanks topside weak-side year for flyquest I was able to dry out that early van now Lilia first pick your for Saint torrent I know lylia got a lot of slaves in the play in stages but I think that was more towards the teams and players usage of the champion flyquest have been very good at designing level ones going after those early Raptor invades into red. Counter jungling so stand for in having that one is definitely a big opening here for flyquest plus they get the playoffs on syndra against night you're not allowed to give him the championsNight by a lot of the world is the reigning MVP on the winning team is going to pick ya Carly if it does go mid vs. the singer is going to be looking for that level 6 kill levels pics all in on this endris of p o e n Santa word better be ready for it by plane is going to be the focus obviously there's a huge advantage to being red side here and this is something that the lpo teams that utilize very effectively especially with 3 6 9 and the attention he gets from both night and car stuff so they're banning out some of the most prominent blind pick ones like Renekton meanwhile flyquest also they don't want some of the counter picks that 369 has used for super hard getting topside being taken away as well the Jacks no fuel or I can mail those types of things as well could come through I want to see if the orne band comes through here as well to get onein this draft is the first pick AP Jungle 2 on the graves and to be fair most is physical damage when rape is Mordecai's it only has 4th most played if the if you put some honestly physical damage but I'm curious if they can get him off of magic damage it allows you to stop armor in survival jungle top game unless you have to worry about true damage coming through as a welder some some crossovers there with the likes of yours so we'll see what they have to do what they have to Blind Pig for him because it is going to be right side First Choice here I would expect it to be I was actually expecting it to be support but looks like they are going to go to the Camila after so many Top Lane Champions have been whittled down to me is that this is going to be the first Camille game of the split 436 but it's going to come through hereis a great run Champion Camille seems to be in the meta as you're talking about Kobe Bryant's top tents to play weakside attempt to not get a ton of attention so that is going to be something that maybe buy a lipstick Leaf like with might have to change brush for ignore right now the hovers going to be a great pic those one of his very best Camp Comer con definitely the two best Champion for ignorance like last week we lie so much on his playmaking him and santorin are the ones who Curry action for the steam far is top loin counterpick here now there's not really any great counter matchups left up into the Camille because Camille has started to run grasp for the Top Lane ever since they had that Nerf on to conquer and it just makes her early and face so much easier to pull off even with the volibear with extreme Lane 3 hours to hear the ability to take extended trades with Camille Camille can actuallyyou will really good W suite behind a slow and you just go in for the grass Bach as long as you don't let volibear get multiple of W's off and makes it pretty difficult to really take advantage they're all right with the draft they're locked in and if no one else walks anymore set support is going to come through we'll have to wait and see if Jack is going to farm on the senate or just go for the metal sickle because keeping mine since to play competitive farming synagogue Nerf and how many Souls were gained we saw some split on Farming versus support center down there so wait to see what comes Thru by Jacquees of course no stranger this campaign has played in a fair bit and we'll see what comes through definitely utility from both bottom lanes and that's actually something that wild turtle has excelled on since the regular split there for the LCS when wild turtle was benched for awhile actually buy flyquest and match came in once while eternal return to the starting roster he just felt so heavily on a lot of these utility Focus 8Carrie gin obviously bring through the long range and snares that they can look for pics and flyquest especially as we prepared to head into summoner's Rift have prepared level 1 to Great Effectiveness in the LCS playoffs so I'm expecting it here especially since they do have Lily at 2nd and Niall ate some of those trash cans like Raptors and wolves look at the 7D games for you can jump in the support light II akali game for the mid laner nighthow far apart is going to be exciting game regardless flexibility of these flares was highlighted by the analyst desk and that just gives you so many options when trying to crack the team compositions going to be a whole lot of fun as you mentioned do the level 1 through flag quests in Turin is the first blood king of the LC there's about worldwide 50% first blood is one of those three Canyon over on down One gaming is stuck in those my believe the threat isn't that worth this year he is absolutely a great really game player to get the gold leaf and that is I think the one player that can stand up here I really do have hocus and Thorin to be the difference-maker if there is to be a flag football upset the odds of course are against them this would be I would say the biggest upset of the year is like was working sex I am already on the table for youwith what people expect as the best team in the world on the right hand side their top Esports had the last two trophies and summoner's Rift the summoner's cup is on the line here we go for the first time in a group stages in world twenty20 flyquest number to team out of the ALCS and top Esports the number one team out of the LPL and the tournament favourites are doing battle here on the rift and we heard from Solon wildturtle they said getting out of groups would be successful R Us that would be a great world performance getting into the top pay for Tuffy's what you saw that tease the LPL want their third-straight world and we see some defensive wording on the bottom side here with the little pixel brush at from talk Esports and the hubber there for the possible Lily Adelaide invade they went through with the early sweet make sure there were no Wards and place the word of their own that Wards ensures that they'll see if top Place one later into it and will be known for the start here for Saint torrent as we said Lily can I lease is Raptor can't because of the are we in the burn in the kit also being able to kite very easily this is a move from carsonville trying to answer that is over the wild me to leave try and get the buffer but don't believe he was just going to be level 301 it's lilias shows up with white fur blue send foreign did not burn his point he was going on right there and Carson you talked a little more or less can happen with Lilia that's why people are so surprised that you know some of the results from play in how much you coordinate your level 145 to milk already is not enough damage to kill it on the top side there's no more potion left here on wild turtle as well in the sustained Advantage will be on the side of talk Esports if they are allowed to continue in this bottom side match up because there's plenty of regeneration insects get through the passive plus I'm with Jackie love having his own biscuit as a well they will sustain the life Advantage with the Minion plush is going to be the difference-maker there as well turn on agnostic and try and get that one in the 200 spell the recall ignore is patching that when they're going to be sticking around going to need some jungler intervention down here on bottom side 3/4 there are some of the smell is Alessia Cara is the only one here his flash is ready he wants to make a play there with that threat so we'll see after bottom size has been cleared looks like to go to crab should be in the hands of horses while he finished his dad up he could make it pass through mid so we're off early colon. Cleanse Right Now cards are going to just make his presence known in the Middle Lane for Kent's down topping and putting back before then comes back in here comes a bit of damage was caused first applied for himself weather Camille this is going to be very very devastating for the match up on topside teleports are still ready so so I won't miss out on any of the minion experience and get right back to it but the early gold will find the Camellia here trying to get to that tree Force as quickly as possible if he goes with the toll for an extra investment they trying to get some extra dividends out of that first Blood investing it for the future there's nothing to look at it at the shield there for solo 2 is going quite good guys extra W off but 369 is able to continue through them despite even with solo flashing the stun yeah better training better Fighting by 369 despite the scale shopping dog bite making this more for the shield and damaged it was still the better stats on the Camille side so well then a369 300 sports so far lands and most places fairly equal to CSF set volume limit because they're still awake to pick up for wild turtle and Aiden are but he's got car stuff blinking in Right Here solo flash list might very well be in dangerous guns to town for a while but Carson knows he's not spotted nose pin to be safe and solo just getting whittled down the moment a free TVs in this is danger sake of the team is already there and this is something you can see from scouting the LVL cursive very often spends his time talk triangle of the map visiting Knights Lane visiting 369 slain and with the summer spell blown up on the top side plus the first blood taken very nicely done for him it didn't actually take very much time at all sleeps into the brush their for Elaine game for himself to capitalize on it and this is going to be a devastating Camille he's not rushing straight for the Trinity Force he goes for weight control because he wants to affect the rest of the map isn't it attack you can make on milk when you get such an early lead like this a an early Tiamat you can violate this minion wave and look to make plays later Camille because of the Rings with your hook shot can set up plays for the rest of your team still effective you going to play as walking the mid lane but Power he was already on the recall for lost chapter pretty decent first Spike was there same goes across per night though on boots and a revolver is going to feel pretty solid text watch a prosperous I want to listen to be shot up there zero in 6 and 1/2 minutes to patients for 369 pays off you wasted that line Bush long enough I sent orange clearing out the ward and they finally strike taken down Bambi returning to the topside without losing too many minion all this is about the way I think I love you expected this game to go top Esports I'll say it again and you're being a big moves out of the top and jungle right now Carson able to lock down and get it pretty easy pick up here in these mountains rate bot Lane Farm Lee has been going to Jackie love so far even just like those retail timing chains about an 8 to 10 PS difference over wild turtle going to have been on fire are the number one team from the LPL
and wildturtle have one before it was on TSM and that was five years ago so now we can see if they can do it here by themselves the third and fourth seeds been exciting playoff run so far today going to be good man I'm really excited to be in to pick up in here I think so much of this series could be decided in the Pickin Band by what door styles the team's want to play by their preparation coming in the series is there so much footage for both of these teams to watch play 20 games in playoffs it's just absurd and his 14th so much film to study you have full knowledge really of what do you think can do coming into finals maybe they prepare something special for this specific day but it's it's raining season in Italy targeted year illusion I think more as that's so lame being targeted by the shutdown piercing cure with the TF Renekton notably absent from that from that band list but perhaps like was feeling like the diddly is going to deny that Renekton from Broken Blade because that has usually been being used as a combo yeah of course you're sick you shouldn't go in a way there as well as a big pic so he's going to be locked in here for fly control through on the Kaitlyn 1 and 3 on the champion in playoffs not saying you can't play it or is playing bethie's they have ended up with losses and who's that with an ash will say though both of us we are getting what you expect on patch 10.16 as set in the second pay for TSM one thing I will say I'm a little bit surprised about exactly this year what time Red Sox and an event like this would have been willing to actually just grab that first pic but the fact they showed that are willing to like that the jungle I think her to give them a little bit more wiggle room on the Red Sox going to hide from their picture set this could be jungle this could be top we did also receive your sin turn in a couple set game in the playoffs people weren't the biggest fans of them and he hasn't been going back to it over the last couple Siri so I'm expecting is more likely to be no probably talk for Broken Blade going into the Zoran and so low it feels like pretty standard for him is that tank do to your expecting something along the lines of these are the Oregon coming out from my question mid laner power of evil they are going to need AP damage already very easy heavy and he is just so damn good at those Champions the Pearson going to get his signature champ it feels like these days and cazillion that was on every single game 5 in playoffs play let's not give our fans a panic attack let's just go ahead and when it's real from the start let's pull the bats the only band TSM Atlanta play the door left foot zillion have a lot of pain Defcon 4 pob I do really like the heck run band once you see the Brazilian has come through I'm curious if they'll actually fan out something like Android on the Pike West Side because I do still think that can turn into the Fantastic, we have to get that much in an A but I do think you can go towards it I think I'm acting up very well against what we're seeing here from flyquest and what kind of have to find out if like he's concerned about that there's also the option of of something we haven't really seen in awhile but nocturnes alien also is a very strong combo 50s and wanted to throw a bit of a curveball you can attack style and very effectively the zillion can throw on the bombs on top of the doctor to send them into the back line before now it's looking like it would be about that slip what year from Camille and that leads me to believe that it almost guaranteed to be speaker playing The Descent in the jungle I don't think that they would Flex the down to support so he isn't looking like they want to save their 5th pick your to try to answer whatever flyquest goes for the try to have a winning to be to end this way final Seraph lacus wasn't TSM because of a difference in style I know some of these very very good talk later and you can match up well against Broken Blade that needs a lot of attention top side fuse on Camille right we are pickling very clearly that broken play it's going to be a primary wind condition on TSM toppling will be an exciting match-up let me know ciento a good jungler in that he will play around with her lame needs to be played a brown you don't love is a practically unbeatable to block did I still favor Black Ops 2 on 2 player on top but they will pass it is pretty bad in the deluxe Deluxe has a pretty good time just poking down Morgana with constant East ma'am I do think that the, makes more sense your what's the deal I pay for the Luxe pretty heavily in that so I guess I'm not really getting value out of their fee back in the situation because life I had such a strong blind pick support in this scenario get them didn't really have the answer so I do actually favored flyquest in that bottom side is going to have to try to get his bandages through top side of the map but that could be pretty difficult because set is going to have a hard time against what we assume will be a face rash Graves he can come down can be incredibly difficult and it's aren't they pretty tough for the Creator Lee Avengers again torrent who is so durable a mess it up very well into these melee matchup so I think I really am preferring the flyquest draft but if TSM can get going if they can withstand the early stages they do have a lot of ways to win with a very powerful combination such as that Camille zillion + is Camille gets to the 2/3 item Mark you can really start to dominate in a sideline what does game is going to play out is going to be super interesting because the only male a champion the only front liner that fly Quest has is their top laner in Solo and so if he's going to join the team flight they can start a 5 on 5 and start doing battle in actually getting about McGinnis should do something in the game no one is answering to meal and so how could the TSM disengage what you've got you know, speed up and car slows and arrows in a zillion and those guys can be boiled in at 4 and 5 in some cases welcome me love taking a base this game will have a unique texture we're keeps want two different things they want five different players and the cute pipes will play out differently here as well I love games like this word for the met at the Gold lead is what really matters is how you actually play out your Mid-America management and excited to watch I agree and I think it's going to be addictive how these two teams look at the Game Dev a very different approach flyquest I think is more in that Team Liquid style bucket where they like to play more v e v front-to-back South you play DS has been spending more and more towards these is kind of skirmish heavy compositions were looking for 4 Flags you're looking to attack from multiple angles and find you're engaged and team flight Victory through that way just run straight at you know the suorin double Marksman shaker style composition in with their Camille and set their Department of really be very successful you have to be creative you have to have proper positioning and really attack from all sides it's going to be a whole bunch of fun to watch them play out of course we're getting ready to get ourselves into game one games are cross-play on the delay for competitive integrity and I want to see this is exactly the kind of place out difference in comp and this is TSM playing kind of pic TSN they are what are the only teams outside of baby really some do with hunted these two sometimes play a top Focus style for than a give him a care either going to give him the resources that broken plate is going to be the wind condition is irelia into GP in that crucial game 5 Jazz yesterday was a big deal he managed to get pretty big man to get over the line those were some big bonus there as well and we get it again here with the Camille we have seen teams screw this one up she is squishy she can go into early chicken be too far from the ceiling to get the revived and throw a gain weight we've seen to use make those mistakes but at the same time we no TSM can do it well I'm a fat house going to play out it's going to be a bunch of fun to watch for and as you mentioned flyquest our team fight focused AR-15 at 5 which means when can you break away when can you join the squad to make the what happened so with Champions like compete we are both way from summoner's Rift for game one Aflac West vs TSM welcome to summoner's Rift for the 2020 LCS summer finals flyquest have beaten the odds and made it here twice in a row this year this time they can Hoist the trophy and what better team to do it Again Sports in Torrance and wild turtles all teammates and the winningest team in else is it 3 TSM with double lip piercing and file Frost back together speaker has been incredible in the playoff run so far Broken Blade out of Texas game exceptional toppling on the Camila player to watching this game and we already some pretty interesting level one starts here so neither team actually ran into each other but the level one tip in a pretty big discussion because I was watching the mini-map and we actually got to see graves in order wrapping around that topside dry brush with eggnog in the bear and pit throwing a binding over the wall to catch anyone who would have been in there so both teams had a pre-prepared level one that they attempted and that does really create the sage of thing thing going for it because I'm going to be so excited to see how many creative level 1 teams have and if they do end up on the same side of the map what that class will look like going forward time is going to be exciting Clash I'm sure they have little ones prepared for all the games in the series hope it goes to 5 we may well get this one here is somebody else yes Ceres have done so got topside starts for both dueling that means if you're doing keto friendly standard runs around 3 minutes they were on top three and they're going to get some action down there in the 212 it can't be hard to force a kill with a Karma but with luck to you and the binding and your Caitlin is ready right away you can turn light biting into your snap trap and not about 400 damage drop the Hat eBay really interested also tracked it here because he should have the advantage in the early levels especially Victor can outrage and praise effectively both with the e as well as if your son ever uses his bomb you can walk past and look for cute rates you do you do have the advantage in that regard as billy gets more levels your Wayfair becomes really really strong and kind of compete more with that and just try to avoid fighting the Victor and war books on fighting that they didn't wave but are you has been such a strong later and I do Ubisoft from him earlier we're know sometimes the flyquest members aren't individually getting as much credit as they do deserve they are respected now as a strong team but they do have some really dominant individual players also I do not so I can take over yes but thus far we do have broken by pushing up here on this topside he actually did go grass so he's really giving a nod to the Early Learning power of the Oreck you know if you are looking for towards a feeling of being able to actually fight the orange in one do you want later on you would want to play more for the Conqueror that is going to help you out better on but more play grass this is going to make the Lenny face a lot easier against you on because if you go Cocker on the Camila he goes for the grass when the or the brutal Frost in addition to those brass crossed 10 make the million active actually quite difficult for Camille in the early stages we do see Broken Blade belt training pretty well and both drunk was heading up for that topside or going to be spotting each other over by this go crabbing in torrent will be able to grab that top one we should be able to easily grab the second of crap on that bottom side for himself though and call Shoppers likely going to reset after that I will say I'm impressed by the TSM living on the bottom side and a dark in this match up with the Caitlin and Lux it is a situation where your TV to becomes actually so much weaker and what are the greatest ranks of this Caitlin Lucks Lane is actually how difficult it becomes proponents to farm when you have them push to the Tower and this is because of the extra area that the Tower actually moves in a from the map so that you can't be using that are in a set of traps on one side of the tower you can drop the Luxy on the other side of the Tower and all the sudden it's nearly impossible for doublelist to farm in that type of situation without opening himself up to potential pulled over free sneakers luxlite buy things and all of these sorts of things so if you are so much harder to set up those types of situations for the Caitlin and the Luxo if ever have to play this Lane defensively they won't be getting nearly as much out of it as they would have otherwise hope what overall still sings looking pretty good here for a black West they probably 10 forcing early teleport year have you feeling like he's in a pretty good position anytime you can actually fully reset the wave and force your opponent to teleport back and you are going to be in a situation where you can just walk straight back to Lane and this is something so I think I was still well just going to send thing that there are multiple numbers coming up here from TSM Bjergsen with missing from mid Lane Suite they hadn't had eyes on him so they know that he could actually be around here looking to make something happen so
happened when wild room were literally attacking the DSM bottom turret mistake that need to be cleaned up but at that same time side trying to cover the orange so there's obviously a lot going into it I do think that flyquest was comfortable giving up the first two dragons but then to miss execution do that here to get sampling incredibly well around that third and fourth dragonfly Quest was not able to delay even a single one of those dragons to push back the soul to get into a more comfortable spot lose those fights it becomes incredibly hard zillion you just can't let it through we have seen Puritan dominating on it too many times and it also enable to place out if they want to go for so you got to take it away I'm going to be interested to see though they just get them people champagne all right side and be with you have offered van table just like I still give go for Caitlin and potentially get over GFwe have yet to see if so far this is worth considering it is a more valuable jungle doesn't mean he's the better than the overall or better 40th overall but like us are retaining this little e Fannin St Louis against because of not being in the first war fix the first 5 picks or identical to track bruising on through we know there's going to be some difference here is I'm excited to see if they do go to the ATF also enables the sort of place out that TSM wants to go for a focused on Top Lane folks on thighs Lane of course TF does not move to the states nearly as well as a cleaner in a very different ways trying to enable your top later by diving that toppling costly by attacking the side lane and putting them in a head so that they can then went through split push or that you can pull upmyquest make them spread out they are going to be playing even just with this core 3 you know they're looking for team flights that that's already predetermined here for the Pike West so apart and try to find pics try to pick off people into V1 that create opportunities utilizing this to you so do the band's changed around anything is 12 / text before it was before we see what else do you leave drop down on a course he had a ton of his ear game for the last couple of weeks. O b a t by damage of a bit also some extra engaged and with how wealthy is inflated round or & Oates in game one I wouldn't be sad to see board game 4 come out for players like for you we there's the three ways that will round out more Fighters that we may play top sites to set up there I wouldn't be surprised to seeplay this game for flyquest does it get to Mordor power Evil 2 best camps with Dory on a thing van out alongside that Sandra I think it would make a lot of sense you can go even for lethal Tempo and just try to poke out and push very heavily jacked I do like a lot you already have double Marksman hear The Counter Strike is going to be incredibly effective you also have to remember you quiet with the w you have to have that auto attack of the carriage ride properly on Jack to connect Eden Isle lot of that damage from coming through if this is that Pantheon is he brought it out in a couple of games did what he did play it three times but that being said as it gets locked in this is going to be supported I will be shocked if it goes power of evil it's going to make such a week or two weeks on that on that bottom side so this is something that is is very much got to pick a ball that you can actually answer in a fuse because if you're not actually slamming that lane you are not going to be able to all in Halen isnot one of the best all-in Marksman sure there's little combos like son into trap with the pantheon but it's a pretty tight timing and I do expect them to lose this duty to their going towards the has ear, as I expected so I think that can be a good answer not really killed at the F but just try to push constantly likely with lethal Tempo you get the prophecy PDF use that on the meetings to try to locked you up under the church and at very least you're trying to make sure that your team is losing any time you leave the line already well ignore support it's a bunch of trash and then the second most play the CrossFit games like us to place before they split in this time around going to be on the third wheel here and I'm sure it's going to look like now because I'm broken blade is on the Jack Plate it here and I'm glad we are still seeing this.right he's not on shine he's not doing redacted any hours I think you be dominant in laying sure but this is a join your team fights but my primary goal is in fact damage output this is a unique texture on the TSM topside yes really only TSM is the only thing left alive in playoffs who plays this kind of style play Can Fly Quest hold up against TSM because he said we're by far better and game once and we still got the same South come in for game 2 and are we going to have a spicy level one because both teams came in the game number one with pre-plant level ones they were the opposite side of the map so they did not actually run into each other so I'm going to be curious as to get this beautiful shot of summoner's Rift to find out if there will be any early game action this time around TSM camping out here just in case it's like what did go for any sort of a deep Ward but there's there's so much going on this game and actually really do want to talk about soit with this ignore pick it's very high risk because I think the thought process is essentially we need something to help answer the side lane play because we are going to have Broken Blade out inside Lane & Ikea folding over to kill them and they are then hoping I think that Pantheon can be out there and also over to try to match that my problem with this is that I don't see you winning that to be too unless you're already playing from an advantage it can be pretty difficult for a Pantheon from the time to really do anything at all to a Jack's especially no post one or two items so I am somewhat concerned that they have given up a lot of Leaning Tower here in that boat length movie to for something that I'm just not that confident is even going to help hold down the jacksthat wants to come through this one because honestly yeah that can be scary if you're not one of the lanes we already saw that teeth in did a great job at sneaking Drake's or just taking it off of Lane control hear the 212 right now is going to be initially pressure for the flak Westside that should make it really easy to attack into spam and knocked on the couch and look for a little too fly ignore and Val frosting and brush to make them both really hard to not going to back out respecting Diwali get you out of that one and goes back in as they fight for those ways yet again so we're going to play in the back side right now is not nearly as good as the trade the Jacks. Not even close you really have to be very careful because as soon as you get level 2 you're always going to level at least strike on Jackson you need to be out of range so you don't take a portrayed like that Broken Blade obviously did already showcased to Jax once in the playoffs this is kind of is that counterpick towards the board and it did work very well for him there I think this is a harbor match of two of you as far as the ones you want to gobut you still can't create big advantages in the side light you can get that point where you're destroying hours and in combination with a TF you really can threaten killed very very effectively I've also got to say that I am pretty surprised by the cleanse here from deadlift at feel like you're having a tremendous amount of respect over that point click Sun from the pantheon feeling like hey if that lands on me and 84 traffic cleared after that then you are get taken down but that's really the only thing there is to clients right like there's there's not a lot here that you're going to be worried about our son has Binaca from the journal and then flash but it's like either situations that don't really happen much so I am surprised by that you know I honestly think that it might have made more sense to just go with something or if you want play morphle and even the teleport in this kind of situation but we'll see if he gets out of it across several of the year as Jack made his way back to get coldhow to play the big light Force Base flashing York Senate think I was already on the road but you can see this is the power of ignoring course he was down there it's because you get a Rover on the map is going to need to pick up boots Studio 300 gold and he's going to try to effect the other lanes and they flash this was his face is laying you can certainly affect you can it's it's something that is pretty dangerous but until power Evil 6 I still don't really think they have that much right and left a dark that's up there because there is no CC you pretty much need the ability to actually scoop the TF back in so it's going to be a tighter time maybe then just like us would like and we'll see if there could be able to take advantage of that new Post 6 you're going to have to play a lot with water expected that is here because if you get shuffled in and a gray shows up your immune trouble at his.stroller that allows broken play to walk back out and he'll back up good Play There's Got The Flash by the way hot seat belt available speaker gave him the road out so well plate of the tourism Duo know someone is lost in that looks scary but the way they look pretty scary especially when you actually drop the war but then he got hit by the smokescreen you lose vision of your own words we couldn't have to that so you had to survive to get out of that smoke store and then hop over to the set with all of the charges available on that crafting potion he can heal right back up the wave is pushing towards them he has that early call so he knows he's not going to be able to just kill this morning not going to be able to really, dominant Lane as far as that funky one goes more about the farming it's more about how we can extend this board we got some damage down there is a car walks in mostly on the opposing the traps come down the products of goes down equal farm right now for the Players Once the has B+ a Castro alive means they can both get 45 on that point in time and we'll see you as the wayis answer this is the standard vs sword recall signing like I'm supposed to be traced back with solo and yeah you press the Dodge as soon as he's done channeling and be Bridal will time out by the time you're done dodging it but the way that she had a pretty bad spot and because so we'll have the advantage he probably has to back off and then TP back in to try to just reset the way his junk down Farm the wave is frozen Again Sam so fat she a pretty rough Lane position right now for Broken Blade and credits of solo is doing a great job in this one be one is up 14 C ask and we'll see how that although shake out after all the men do that cleared up but when you're drawing attention up on that top side and you're winning out anyway it's going to buy more time for your tongue go down the bottom sides with his black with him this time that grab that first dragon no chance of an immediate snowball this game from PSN deal here as well looking at how this had played out there's alternate reality where bjork's it is able to hold down a bot Lane right there as flyquest try to push the wave afterand suddenly you get the kill on Glenn's listen that becomes a whole situation but to walk over Drake and then still pushed away with way more than once already get a recall when they want it BS or boots plus the breaker. Felt very good stuff down here but now he is going to probably head topside solo is alone Fire Authority there goes Graycliff play v i o Frost absolutely beautiful knocking in right back in the waiting arms of the jacked everyone's backs off to give for his blood to the Jacks I guess what solo just TP back every top laner knows that is the nightmare situation when you die immediately after utilizing that tp5x the wave can be frozen on you or I could be fully reset your losing minions either way and your opponent is going to get that free recall off very very likely Sophieangry so happy about how that's how claim play shake out too late maybe so cheap is back in the wave is in a rough spot for him he eaten actually fully reset it he goes to drop the ward and already TSM is there waiting to charges on Culebra con frases behind so sad it's fine don't worry about I can get out of something and maybe I can still Escape I'll flash over the wall is here to come onwell off of the top side of the knife is Broken Blade gets up for this one ss just catching his farm down there will have a small CSF is it to his side and so far so good for the flyquest I was one but yep first what is relevant to ask him to feel pretty nice couple of seconds on the road going to the essence Reaver build its overall lower David borrero probably focus on that role sounds about right for the team composition how are Vehicles ready for him pretty closely with Bjergsen keep in mind you can about for extra gold per or Cs on Twisted Fate the math you say okay well right now from the TF passive the gold leaf outside of that is equaland it is going to be interesting to see how this game does play out because what was until you think know when you're out front line on the team looking for and who can take out that a sharrow becomes more difficult to use when you realize that while the orange probably could be stuck in the side Lemos the game actually answering the Jacks and there's no plans on any of the four of the other members and they're all squishy all of a sudden become so dangerous and turtles in trouble you can get more damage that's what they could have signaled a lot of them right there but it meansso when you go that CPR build any time he hits a narrow on anyone except the or who's probably not even going to be able to be group with the team of the time it's going to be incredibly dangerous to really build a teen and broken late getting solo dangerously low there he may have to just back it up even with since we're moving up towards that pops out of the map now speaker is spotted but
yep psychic all I could picture was going to be racing riding motorcycle and sidecar with goggles on you know exactly hyperformance go this year so please do not enter any more it had such a clear game plan and I just feel like a question what you were doing is not working and I think they have to try to mix it up you know I'm not saying that they need to try to btsm an argument stop playing and play split wood but don't blind Pickett born allows solo to pick a match up that he can go even in that he can go further into the game or even get an advantage in that he's strong on Champions like you pee and he is a strong word to Kaiser he has more than just that or he is going to be a very proficient often or possible lot of texts at the Jason's in there for him so I just think they need to mix something up because right now the game plan for TFM husband counterpick top put your son is something that can go to the side lane andall resources in a Broken Blade they're donating kills they're going for man top they're diving so they're keeping on sold their you know all sing to him constantly and that he just needs some help in pic of in-depth not pricey TSM put the pressure on for actually set in the jungle this has been the high fries Ash and semah is pretty much a wash down there at the bottom Lane they can wait on Midland a little bit longer than OTF is not a contested pick p o e has not shown it and it was a difficulty for TSM when they played Team Liquid was the weight we can guarantee another tank tank somewhere else engage somewhere else in the lotto silicon actually maybe when Elena gets broken blade needs to happen baby here and they say OK Google skip a chance to kind of Macbeth Lane in time so now or you can come through in time to answer to you before the pants come through and black was finally show us a new look where they can actually kind of yourselegant actually kind of broken play exactly I think that should work a lot better I am expecting to be the fifth pick for solo now you've given what they have done is Duff's bar Santa also is going to help out so low in a lot more than the Caitlin or the Asher whatever how you can take this matchup to send an ultimate can help to this way to get them from going so hard on his own and this I'll answer looking for Dives then I'll make it so nice turn that around with the damage and shielding can be quite effective they have some very good hard engage in 5 E-5 with his Dallas cop that Santa can also help to reach back line alongside that hackerman Oriana strap the ball in the horse beat-em-up use the Shockwave off of the fear sent all over the top pretty strong combo and I'm expect that like wet this rope warband Awards Broken Blade we still have to be able to receive tax levy take away and I'm expecting to get away on Nick. Write this man really plays mostplay sin gate Campisi price to make things happen and duck to write get the setup for the carries the backline there I wouldn't be shocked to see a Pantheon bad or some other engage support otherwise I can't say exactly is it to me that that makes it feel like you wanted like you pee and I wonder if they would even spilled wine Pickett I think it's not worth hiding your support at this point the game is not being decided through bottom line your bottom line has been fined if and holding up but it has been about the plane so I really do want to see them I'd a solos pick I know this is not the traditional flyquest style they have them playing different styles but I do think that you have to be willing to try to adapt in these that the fives they are going to Blind pick the GP with that blue tube and it was something that there was definitely on the trail at the very least you know this is not formedyou can get to a point where we've cleared fantastic you can somehow somehow try to stay on the west side of the map and also the other side for the help out with the engages in a 04 Altima backline acronym goes in there and you're hoping that he does not get absolutely destroyed in the one they wanted and run over cuz if you can't die if you can you can't really see each other so really it was it was picked last time around really does not the pic I really was just coming through Lassen around as the answer when they saw the Gangplank we know it's going to be barred in the in the support role set jungle is almost certainly get a case you're Barbara's looking around but we know is picking a real. Weiner here I do I get to set up there I think I'm going to get something else so what is your Aunt the counter pick on the j3 and we'll see if this be enough third Nautilus game of the split a lot of engageddive over on the side of flyquest the game plan here is pretty clear a lot of Gucci members knowing you're looking over at the ass when you're looking over at the date the TF you drop the TV ultimate on their head in the sand in the horse send in the Nautilus ultimate sin El Tovar top you follow up with the Shockwave there on the other side it's the same plan for TSM here it's play to the sidelines look just put the map look and try to catch people out when they're enrolled agent no absorbing defend against those engages try to slow down the snowball to Ward's soul that fly Quest may be looking for but I will say I still like this this match of a lot better for solo than the previous ones we've gotten shirt NJ speech EP sure yes but you can also get to a point if you're not ran over in the early game where Jace can no longer really punish you you get the point where they're clearing out ways you can trade fairly effectively with grasp and you can survive that match a build a little bit defensively hold on and we'll see if his team could defend him enough to keep him from getting go to keep him from getting Crushearly because I do think if you can hold on early this is a much better setup for flyquest and we seen lots of times around a well a better setup a 2020 LCS finals TSM back on form for the first time in three years but are in the finals in the favorites now with a 2-0 lead up against black West who had a great year themselves the Rebrand we had three Quest we had Seaquest we have back-to-back finals 2020 has been good as organization but they are staring down the barrel of a second 03 run in 5 happen against Cloud9 just last wits it's about to happen again CSM here in summer in less they can find themselves to win and sores Gangplank is a champion that can do it was very good of the champion wild turtle has had an exceptional Center so far all split lawn and power bill finally got the counter pick the mid-length to handle beers but so far the Dane has had the way better side of that matchupthe dive is going to be a lot harder in a with that sentiment available especially postix it just so cute he must protect Solo in the early game that being said it's somewhat difficult because you have gone for hecarim early who is going to be losing out to do in priority towards that sat in the speakers going to have the advantage is far as that one we went goes igp is going to be at a disadvantage Pearl Lian unless you can really get a lot of good grass cute Ponce de Leon the on this day tactical come down I'm so you're two V2 isn't great but you need to make sure that you're there to Shadow him toward out for him to try to protect him from that set 3 doesn't affect on right now really game is broken blades way they met in the top River until the last half of health bar yeah you can eat potions but it's not believe in something went out right now is total take some more poke in an early anchors bascom's in for some decent damaged by the way Auto cue is a ton of damage report back up to make sure that trade really wet positively end of the day though the wave is still controlled by TSM in Vale hits to which is 140 help swingexactly and it's always hard as Nautilus because if you go in for that book you can talk a lot of damage on the way out he gets load up by obviously the follow you can get slowed up by the Q from the BART even if it does find the have to make sure you're not taking too much damage on the exit of getting ice here on santoor it has to be really nice for them you can see that that is already sneaking around behind this GP so it's the same thing as always the game plan in full effect was going to find himself a stun you can not eat oranges or apples 5e Centaur to yesterday but since I was already seen bottom side with no Health this is pretty rough. I think it will eventually push toward solo because it is closer to side of Broken Blade but he still going to lose a lot of minions cuz it's going to be a fast Bush by any means I use down level you don't even want to TP because you know if you TP your junglers not there be insects still waiting in the brush it's essentially just FF likeso we have to walk back to Lane which means it's going to be a free reset for Broken Blade as soon as he didn't teleport Broken Blade can actually just fully push out that way that's going to reach the tower he walks back Tulane he gets a much better file off of this and again it's it feels like like West need to be better prepared for this event has been the same thing on all three games they're going to attack your top later you feel horrible in those early levels and they need to try to better defend him and be expecting it isn't a very good passing jungler but you know is it was chickens rather than a full clear boss I bet he's nowhere near top of the game comes in instead of something you know where you end topside it tuned up and someone that I think was going to juggle them in this series and Central run has not been that in the finals and a lot of that credit is Speaker stepping up all right then last year comes in this split off of a TS macavity rundo you know I have pain has gone on as Pinot functionally a rookie he's gotten better and better and better and he's been outperforming players with seven years more experience than him I think speakers Future's So Bright in the ALCS he is clearly a mechanical got really really good from yesterday to realize how clean is guys mechanics are you extending the Shen taunt catch the grave and then flashing the Tauntaun to multiple carries things like that you just do not see very often so really it's just the experience do you need to be able to have more and more games under his belt he's developed tremendously throughout playoffs throughout this split and I think that it was future is very bright for him in the LCS and absolutely is and he could be well into winning his first title it is first full split as a starter and not just a stand-in as you said went through jungle roster Roasters at the first time she said that you got a Tumblr they want to stick with for more than a year at a time realistically in a homegrown talent that little time little bit of time Xbox AcademyAcademy on the main stage straight in the finals here of course the band back together bjornsson deadlift about frosting out of the topside yeah pretty good trade in a broken plate he's himself with refresh man who once he's comfortable on that recall having to walk back out long ago for his door and blade and we'll see what comes through the bottom side is right now there's a very big farm and now a repo nice bit of damage there about Rush Truck low but here comes with his faith canceled by a zika is in danger of blood comes through it. Just after he's done his Praises I am sorry for the cast of her speak up for the help from the store running low on health backwhat a good set of play there though from flyquest sidestepping the barbecue fighting back the Shockwave canceling the TF ultimate it what essentially is almost at school before they fight their way out didn't I lyrics in the ability to actually enter that keep it into a to be free territory turn it around and get the kill themselves Pop Rocks over the top and look at the little dual and the Q you're over on a vial frustrating damage wants to talk later canceled because I thought Pearson was going to be there flashing out but if the chart is still locked on another one does lent and then late heal from double if I missed out on the first play not sure if you want to save them or not but now we get to watch grigson get Shockwave that Ward over the wall really hang off and that was a shock wave Elgin boarding position and to me that tells me you know exactly the range of the TF ultimate because that is the spot from which you would have to roam keeping that Ward instead of just a side brush gives you full information ofhe's going to the playoff he's just hiding a Darkness a really intelligent word and quick fingers for power bi will shut that down and it's not just a place of it like yes it's a reasonably common War because it's coming from chickens down to your lane but it's also like I'm going to make sure it 5:45 this world comes down there for the TF LG Flex 2 minutes if you can do anytime before 7:30 I'm going to have Vision on the old tea and I can get him if he goes Bob because it's fine but lands at Target and good on him to do so you know you could have been right there that's the Top Lane rain generator the pink word right there at the end credits of solo and it's just now coming back up and he's really not that far behind yes is teleport is down now both of their teleporter down he's gotten post 60 has gotten the sheen by which is really win GP starts to feel pretty comfortable the flat man of flus the augmented Q obviously with that bonus to damage that makes your bearas long as you're trading much stronger so solo can kind of get into this comfort so now we're becomes much more difficult for Broken Blade to actually punished as long as he's not going to know if he's going to be so blue diamond hand it off right now if you eat first to level 8 in the game right now is the Toppenish doing Battle of good shots with your life every single Skittle shot and broke his leg is 10 gold thank you very much for the extras that lady is going to be continually push pin or the cloth overnight with another big shot glass and solo but speaker is here as well past revealed himself sweeper down get rid of the wars solo what do you even do here do you always wear a wave do you hope you can feral trade I mean if you see them at all you've got all for the way if I think he has a ward in the pit so I think he just saw speaking now yeah he does he said he never got cleared out so we actually awarded over the wall so that prevent him from having to just straight-up leave or off the wave Ace Oswego backed off after clearing that because of that thing for the credit to him forturn those words out in really solid spots that allows him to do stuff without having to overcommit do anything much yesterday Mark you're looking for for a Philly Avid s34 sign is 14 minutes that'll be timer we will track here so far he's been farming well admirable Cliff 66
there's only major questions that I kind of have coming into this one look at the most common champions for Santora's first blood king of the LCS the first part of the world would you even look at all the other top the top performer there if you get them on a trundle for a pillar or something like that it went really salty because he could pull the trigger and they can leave so low on food like the Gangplank to display sweetie times before flyquest are not letting up in Italy bands game ticket sites like with the loss they say all right will take red deal with it he probably expects you know that it is finished now because coming out of yesterday I was thinking calm and sense could be just keep it for TSM they're going to flex it between jungle and top cuz they don't want to pick up early an adult hits solo would be willing to pick it fly to try to absorb the pressure and have relevant Elsewhere on the map but I did like that flyquest know it's wrong to one side of a kind of the spectrum as far as if you're going to play against a 1-3-1 you either have to draft a match the 131 we have to draft the punishment 3 man squad with the soul of this was right and they went hardcore with Nautilus Plus plus Oriana speed up hard engage point-and-click PC they were looking to bring out here it will be Turtle do off of Santa who you don't know what the analysts that's with the big fan of and did honestly help out solo some in that silent having this an alternative back you up and be pivotal in those types of scenarios Caitlin obviously incredibly strong Marston they're not willing to do that over so it's just going to be Kaitlyn versus that Ash apps that every single time it says come over and over and over again to play for most of last week because like lifting a load of the top bracket to get either TSM bertila play against then they're going to play one of those two over and over again they must have seen that they couldn't be pollution game the split and they could never handle it and that's it but to to put too much pressure on that window other Marksman Orban seems unlikely never being left out that they couldn't beat that inscription to look we've put in the practice against we know we can't do it we're going to keep that off the table go ahead and play Aztec clearly teeth I want this and fly plus 4 in flexible in their van because they know what to use empty well with and that's exactly is viewers can't see but these teams clearly understand if they're playing the games out I think it's a great choice here by the way to be strong team fight before it gets banned away from flying power people so this is the first kind of inflection point does beer go back to TF back to the sideline or they go for a little longer Sandra or something a bit more aggressive and try to really go out how are we will end that would kind of signal that they want to look more towards thermostat they want to look more towards v v v fighting black let's head to head and that is going to be the change here I thought there was opportunity for MBR accent wheel lock in that tender his career most played Champions everyone was talking about the zillion but you can't forget about this Sandra he has been a monster on it for years and years and years and now I'm really curious does this mean that you have time is going to fully opt out of that book wished like will they still go for the Jacks will they still look for a Camille or are they just going to go to war more of a straight-up Bobby V South Off winner something like the Border Kaiser something like a tank of their own and looked really just play or the team fight and try to outplay flyquest in that scenario good chance we see something come through like wow it just think they're sticking hey you know set-top may still be the case because the game one as well by the way that's like West in the second phase of band through a couple of jungle bands and in case vent wet set with up there a couple enforcement for unknown for is Evelyn and play it here as well they must have seen that he had put it in the plasma cells and what is it and screams there as well and so need some couple final bands come through worth pointing out the gate by TSM I think he's the king of weeks I top laners has the way we could you could you don't lose your trip when you get dope and mordekaiser off the board as well as like I'm going to throw into support fans on top that's probably as if you want to go a middle ground you could still go Jace and cuz Dave can play for a for pushing top and get an advantage and a group and still do you bite especially if you're looking for a kind of an earlier Spike alongside that then dry you're making with Jace what's the sender is going to be really really strong for that v e 5 pill that is an option if they want to kind of go somewhere in between like hard commit Side Lane. identify any flights this is very interesting to me that he does so much his game has has moved around on how much pressure has been topside and getting a good backup that you enjoy Jake's is going to be blind here thinking that shoulder baseball outfit has worst to get in the blind dates here instead or they really really care about the Fort Magic which of course relevant here as well don't get me wrong. We're caught is by far the most played bass left in the pool for the matches for the certainly there for the comfort side and like what's a note where to go back for engaged we still like ignore on a playmaker and he will beat the rakan is up he says base the champions in the board if that's dangerous here for the knock back a lot. Pantheon it's better for me if we are going to chase here and I'd like what else is in solos pool they really worried about right words band GPS band Shannon fan Lucian is banned in other potential like really aggressive fixed so it probably expecting the orange and if you're okay just playing for pressure and playing for push on that Jace I think it is totally fine to Blind that cuz they all right I'm going to have priority tops for to be able to play for Dragons renewal play for schedules will have push with the center will have push and priority with that Jace second match up fairly well against at volibear and then if you leave your support Pick 4 last and you get a counter in that support to be to that you have a winning Lanes potentially three ways and you can play heavily for the early Dragon stacking try to get yourself into a situation similar if they did in game number one where they are heavily ahead as far as the objective as far as the dragon and then try to force us to come to you at that third dragon fight be ahead and gold be ahead and power and dominate there and on the other side it's going to be up to fly quest to try to withstand that Onslaught to try to utilize but they're really really strong scaling here and to avoid the pantheon attacking this Jason picking on the Jade because unlike with the Jackson aside land adjacent definitely died to a norm plus Pantheon Yeah Yeah Yeahs call certainly in these Lanes you have flu Escape out has Morgan Elaine overall that situation that TSM is in is I am a fan of santorin and hizbullah there you can get in there and get stuff done the question is can he do it here in this crucial game 4th TSM are still on Match Point flyquest must-win to keep this finals alive otherwise dies in Walking trophy black women certainly love to get their first it be the first year as well as across-the-board across-the-board question is can they get over the Finish Line afterwards call to find out we are into potentially the final game here flyquest obviously would have to continue that reverse sweep they looked so much better in that last game they do have some good engage options here they do have those go buttons but that the pantheon support you know I remain unconvinced that I do think it is a very risky pic to be going back towards you have to be playing from ahead you have to be able to push the pace with this text because when you are behind on it it has no fallback plan it does damage and it goes in and that's about it used to a lot of it coming into this series all time with a barely Katie above one but wasn't engaged in this is just I'm just a man who is famous for as you hear the story retold eventually he couldn't really play Architects Sports back on the very famous Misfits roster where they took SKT to five games and so he brought out for Leona as the answer to the Ardent censer meta and did pretty well he did he did great on it but he's always been an aggressive roaming support kind of player where he's going to get in there to make the big blazing you know set up for the tea and then ignore has had a very good split plank dance like this brush work on Pantheon. That's his wheelhouse here and yeah the man who could look pretty bad like you're going to enjoy but you can try to get out of that lane and I will say the differences in fall back between a threshing work on and the pantheon is pretty extreme right because we're always has the ability to get those multi-man CC's multi-man knock UPS play it more defensive has the ability to peel utility of the lantern to slow the box is just like you and become very difficult are you do have incredible potential to Rome with a point-and-click cc that is very strong but there is kind of a timer on it you got to be able to make things happen you got to be able to keep getting aggressive when we saw come out earlier wasn't able to find that affect me so we'll see if you can this time around so far for both 80 carries the first push goes over the flak West Waverly early Ward comes down from PSI vs Gastelum starts the word to see if he's coming down early on for some kind of really really early about before they come here where there's not a lot of surprising crowd control I got a Pantheon jump and that's it and if I can walk away and you know. Even if needed and I feel afraid they're from speed up TV going for, at 2:10 to do with rage matchups and tries to fly to the to the 110 that Pantheon son is that is twice now that he has gone up or fat summoner against this specific Champion Yorkton running very low on men here obviously he is playing for the teleport but you know what power of evil sitting in a more comfortable position if he can get that push you can reset the way I can save it all apart will still getting off at base and that's going to put him in a pretty darn nice spot for finds a couple in the ice pick up there from the bottom scuttles going to make the bottling feel safe without a lot of pressure right here at the Blacklist do is just hard pushing the two on two right now finished putting fight back and forth there as well as if it takes a dammit TV does the same and we got ourselves a pause the future and you have our faces on camera again that's true hopefully we will be able to get this pause sorted out quickly hop back in but until then we can talk a little bit more about the series about this sort of a matchup it is one of those things where you do expect Morgana in Ash to have the push and I do think that they should but the one caveat is that you have to respect the potential of Tanks coming through no Volver plus that Pantheon is that is a very strong will stun combo yes you have the Black Shield but if black child is born song cool down or if you get a flash done on one target you flash a once on the other these types of plays that you can look for perhaps they can get punished if they are over pushing so they just to be somewhat careful about that but up on the top side know we can see the Broken Blade actually did go for the call so I'm kind of curious if he is going to go back towards and we're scaling style of play and I we haven't seen him go for anything other than just really sality but there are options such as universal or scaling feels like going for the tyr build and trying to play more heavily towards like Amazon alrighty walk still go back to this way you can see the farm pretty equal up the topside although there is more for Brooklyn Define so we should be taking it seriously eventually it dark for the Deep Ward plays and actually I mean look how low gear going to stay in for so long but I think they got hay but missing but still you can see XP and gold Awards he sent torrent and Dierks it is just not in Lane right now and if you're still be able to be back in won't lose too much ignore can put toward unpack speaker and that means about like a flea but be careful because what great time as slow down to 150 back tonight during that mid-length not losing anything on that bottom side and you were jumping biofrost out signing and back to basin who's experienced and gold off of a couple minions including the Canon which can feel pretty painful in early stages that being said he got two words that here who is going to be comfortable as far as the man that goes he can continue holding on in this Lane farming it out and once you get six of your threat is going to do a lot up there is a potential then of gangs in a really looking to to take down power of evil and I'm going to be curious to see if TSM can establish push on that bottom side and start moving towards stacking some of those dragons those kind of expecting that they might look for with this type of draft I've been going back and forth right now small farm in a few we we are going for the Farmingdale by the way up here to me. Power truck picked up to your he picked up exactly 0 combat stats it was already getting bullied around in this Lane how are people forced to 6 sports playing for war controller on midlane but look at that describes Lewis perfect mid-length push level 650 is here and that means the warts go away it is Ragan is almost certainly a Target looks like like us will make that first move and we can see the speaker is up on that top side maybe going to try to go for solo has been kind of the Ritz Northeast Academy field for TSM bottom size velour is potentially on an option to try to force them off a little bit but with power of evil having the shop right now in mid-length lanes are going a lot better for expect it has been really good stuff the first reason come again means you always get the push on the first wave that comes in right in front so that was like a coniferous recall is going to be going down so 6:40 into the game as X exhaust what do you want the first to go back to the late and faces so far so good for so long top side is spelled Buckhorn by the way we have seen grass before the melee matchups you look at the grass because Jay Siegel spell book for some other kind of power instead allows him to ignite for trades or goes cleanse away from CC and that may
I want to be cool like this thing as part of the good parts of the origin roster they stopped him out for Jacksonville and it got worse so you know I don't I don't want to give anyone with TL exerts a is outstanding in Destiny was about to run has as well so just got lucky with you know we'll move on him and Mortals going to do the best as well but it's going to be it's going to go through gameplay can meal dropped out from Elsa and the seraphine bad I like this year from Team Liquid no more of the the baby proof bottom Lance for themselves at you mentioned as a coach do they have goes without saying first year for four and other previous play but it also means oh my God is so quickly here quick on the pantheon I hope he keeps it in the jungle because we are still free Nerf junglePantheon Earth where they made the Q reduce damage apply to Jungle monsters as well so we're in Zurich to get to make his LCS debut on the champion I expect to see what I can get out of that one is flying through in this draft liquid or do you like in their contents they've dropped somebody say figs here we get the yellow name for the side of Team Liquid on one of these assassins always love seeing him on the echo on the akkala even though people flame and so much for the one Echo Miss Donuts melee carries I love seeing the side of him I hate it when he gets relegated to buy ice farming and there doesn't move a lot from mid fool let's get that you own a in their al-fari on thea good counterfeit that he's showcase up in Europe arelio do picked up a Revenge this is goes really well with panty. Naked try and kill this cannon for sure you're all in is devastating with this combination I expect them to activate a Californian or question we posed earlier on the intro where are Mortals going to attack should be both Sidelines I think it was both very viable here with blitzcrank lock in on the bottom side to being able to break Shield hit those big hugs I am so excited we got a whole pack of new players on the side of a mortal that we didn't get to see in in lock in plus going against the Champions with this type of draft exactly what we were asking for a freak shoot for the moon and Mortals you're going against Team Liquid they just come off of Victory and you have a new Squad put together but you got nothing to lose. You can shoot for the moon and then lose 90% of it when it goes back that $50 which you know happening sometimes but it soonincredibly high-profile players in Alf re-entrant Torrid this is the roster everyone is looking at honestly I was kind of shocked they actually got brought to five games by cloud nine the file because they weren't they were stopping everybody they were the team to look at they had to drop the game until lock in finals with that roster there still my favorites to win World I'll just I'll say it for a while and then I can be the first one to be right when when identity happens regardless what is this is the team together and there are some very good names here and and look there's a chance they can win but the very least you look good here and then and where the heck we are going to play the title and it's a proactive graph they are looking to create place here you don't pick Pantheon and farm up free especially not against the New DealCersei this guy that I've been looking at from Europe really really have liked his Innovative jungle pass this guy has done your level to Red Bluff galaxy has done all caps into a bottom side camp like it he easily can can be the playmaker for this game and steal the show and enter the LCS with Fanfare and Is His Name In Lights also going on top of that he's playing Pantheon his team is Immortals and his name is their say-so the 300 memes are just going to be plentiful I know that you've already got like six of them he is literally playing what is there say the ruler of the Persian Immortals definitely going to be a wrapped up here top side though already Revenge going to wait in that brush the Canon you can try and arrange her ass there really early but you're really a big into that is supposed to be forno pressure is supposed to be hey Pantheon come up in point click Duncannon because then he's dead it's Pantheon clicks done into a rally is done follow-up and that is a dead your door so Windsor say starting blue intergraph can easily just go straight to read from here and try and gain topside it's it's very uncommon for LCS junglers to to do just three camp in to gank usually it's much more power clearing because you don't want to get cancer invaded on but yeah you know when you're going to get this line up and you do want to try and punish Doubtfire early it is an option will talk about in his in his you know play The Weeknd review was that like look you know junglers are all too strong right now so supports our support to make the place to junk those are not the ones doing that anymore so you know until we go to moorgate focus junglers it's got to be supports doing it does have his specssickle so it is chords JJ getting all the last it's still very possibly get a ton of damage output from the Senate of gold all that fun stuff we stopped at first but Sven play phenomenally a good day for the guardian Shield will not shop all right as the hooks start the land here we need to go into this matchup cuz I really love with Frank pics always into Tom can't you can break his thick skin Shield basically nullify the defenses of this Champion that that people will sometimes complain about plus you can get to 41 polls if he eats tactical from someone else's CC that you pull in the time catch to get both of them and you can still break the shield I just really love that as an answer for possible kill pressure since that has been our theme of this game is is looking at where they are going to apply that fit don't hesitate to the tripod first do double sweepers means they both knowVictorious the wire frame and those who stay there but can't see the super of the Wally there's like wait a second I thought I'd see new deer warts are gone and decides to give away control of the brush but yeah the number to hear they know Top Lane is where the shenanigans are happening son's going to land a Revenge goes into the play Flash The Flash face and it was nearly enough to kill off same tour that was so sick by Revenge drive there cuz you know if it really is going on that trade and you see that minion low house is going to jump right back to it On Cue he's hoping that he can do it quicker though that that's what that is he saying I have faster fingers I can fly and get my bear slap off before you queue back cuz if I do you're dead but a Revenge take that opportunity I had loved that he's playing on the edge this guy is not ahyped up as some of the other Academy pickups no heat it at smash Academy but revenge is Young North American talent at the top of the solo queue ladder love talking about how he went to bed school delayed his professional career and honestly it's showing some big brains right there so you know what give him give him the five bed he deserves it has been pushed in a pond at the farm league right now for the time catch Tomcats winning line-up against this guy so honestly Independence because the hook and it was going to kill you got about 14 seconds of stealing however you want that means they can walk up and and do some damage and indeed the potions are a little bit but we will have to jump through his potions in Spanish how far back up that was a great look like destinytruly was Destiny Atlanta a lot of these hear the opl All-Star bottom Lane coming in pretty hot as well no Bloodshed yet did not get a first blood out of the top side but I know Immortals are versus the lock-in Champion that being said they're losing that does start to add up on you that. Start to whittle away here as Team Liquid farming very nicely and the Midland where we talked about no Jensen on the yellow name he's forming extremely well for himself uses early teleport back but got rice backs of pushing and immediately upon arrival. A little too early for two seconds later you grab him out a hook and it's fine and said you gave it to me for one exactly it still means they're going to be able to push in on that Tower though as you said no no harm realDoug off of that Tactical for JJ have the advantage on bottom side pushing the first wave into the tower they are in the turret light themselves cash in there get there recalls off to reset as well and can get back super quickly you see the rush on your boots of swiftness here for Tactical for Santa gets out they're extremely quickly both of them rushing to Tier Two Boots and I love this watching your first recalls from bottom Lane you want to head out towards the middle of the map both of you so you have the option of Haunting the reset from your opponent if you want to head towards mid or pressure or head back to bottom land in since they did see Destiny clearing out the control word they just make a quick pivot tactical at by the way on your mini-map you can see he even stopped off at the red but it is very important for Senna to stack up as many Souls as possible you get guaranteed once off of just passing by if the timing works out with your uncle Ron what does campsnow you want to lay it down in the LCS freak and Mortals or Avenger makes it happen no fear he shows no fear on the top side with jungler around Bayside is Flash goes for the one do you want this is why you pick irelia for your aggressive top laner he got to the top of the ladder playing carries playing Riven so give him the irelia into can match up Revenge does it level six year he hit Level 7 off that minion stacked up his passive goes for the all income it's under the tower even with the ignite from al-fari back out to the minion so he doesn't have to take the extra Tower shot and earns them a topside Advantage santorin will punish with a dragon for himself as the bottom line it bad to still heavily in the favor of Team Liquid with tactical cord AJ pushing but this is a champion and Mortals here pulling off some big moves earlyhow beautiful play up there before the gold is still tied between these things because right now bought is smashing I mean absolute people suffer the TL Duo they are winning this Lane by far the first plate plus the Cs and of course with that they get the dragon as well so TSM take notes what your boss is willing come grab a dragon it removes the wind condition so far so good team liquid still picking up nicely but you got to give credit where it's due to revenge for taking down later in the LCS right now takes me to take the skill match up and actually blast it off so sorry yes for sure nobody else had even close to that was for solo kills in lock into those odds calculatorthese are the ones that count for the split Team Liquid do object is all going their way despite the celico despite the height and it's up there of one be wanting santorin is all over these objectives he has he has really really well. Of course this is what you do with the meteorite you are all about efficiency and farming and getting to the objectives that said though he is roughly equal Farm to their site but to those camps I was way more important it's a dragon and a red-tailed those are going to pay dividends in the endgame to look at have swapped they're doing after the topside Revenge thing alone up here and try to hide the fact that he hasn't called yet this is actually this is an outright 3 V2 problem is you're going to show up and show up with his out an easy fight anymore if they don't take this if I don't get something out of it well they willI was going to say if they don't make something happen here you are giving up a tremendous amount of Temple bottom side you see how far is pushing that wave in but they do free the patient's plays here from Revenge heated weights in the brush right until tactical walks into him there so deep in the lane with a blitzkrieg neither one can escape this is now three kills for Revenge blade of the ruined King picked up for 11 minutes into this game and if you are al-fari but you do not want the ones you want with him so he's going to back topside is goodbye could not get away for the rest of the combos three holes means to kill as much as we do you want to have time to throw the phrase is out how far he says yep I don't want the one be one with the threeAurelia I'm coming back topside will you will do the exact same play Team Liquid with the response another look at this play as you no tactical walks right into him into the brush actually look at the live cameras though because with the ripped out and then
nothing up justice like what tattoo after the first two game system does not seem to be able to match flyquest as far as a team fighting goes and if they want to commit suicide last night I think they either have to go towards a scaling Jayce build and hard commit to the sled push it with Kira Black Fever of living room king of these types of things into a tank or they have to go towards a top layer of the scales better is one day when they can dominate like the Camille like the Jacks for 10 T even something along the lines of Fiora they've got to really commit to that place Dallas or not to be able to win in the Bible 500 flyquest back on right side only twice all series have there been there to the most choosing blue in the TSM piece of writing was working there and it means the Caitlin band comes the run right side Lucian is the band that is left up as a result and TSN says ok google take your son away push you down to a shin said that it has been the highest win rate 80 karrie for both of these players in the postseason they take that tray back and forthwill take the set that you've been playing for speaking so often solo play Sadie set wealth than foreign Place take set exceptionally also 50s them on the graves and the tfv8 lock back in for Bjergsen so I really do like a crazed pair long side this Anne of the Senate is relatively low DPS if he's going to go for multiple tank Bryant Myers said it needs some help killing Frontline in CFA help to fill in with some of those responsibilities but I do think with the TF getting locked back up again TSM to go towards at Heart by slippers to play two words with silent I don't think we're going to get in or anything like that from DSM I think they want to play this before so I wouldn't be surprised to see some Dan from that way if they are worried about something like Two Jacks potentially plaque with could also lines ups that is left up I'll see if that's going to be the case in the panwhat are the bad here ignore I think was really good on it last game and I did doubt I think both of Lane as well as how easy it would be for mosquito bites but I've got to credit his time and he was able to draw so much pressure in those who dwell time Shield steam rooms or damage being able to create pressure in a lot of those fights and did play it exceptionally well yes indeed look really good for pancakes I was curious and it was actually work on which is bile Frost most played to the end of the series and it makes me wonder if he is Sam just didn't like what the match it look like if the game played out for didn't like the champion in the team compositions overall but regardless or support fans come through you got time.Orofino High HP Bruiser if they wanted to go towards the jacks or whatever they wouldn't vandemore to Kaiser if you're already kind of thinking that if they wanted to go to the GPU probably wouldn't be in the morgue and it is going to be hard case here a lot of it gave a lot of guys I've already for the flag beside you haven't Leona follow that up with the Oriana fall set comes flying and you have the Ashera was well I do feel like we're gone is kind of the one that screaming out to me in a being able to Lane very well against of Leona be able to block a Cheryl's be able to stop a lot of Assisi that could it come out from there and they do have it be available this time it will be a last pic though for solo and we know it could be said top it could be that jungle they have the flexibility there were gone I think it's I think they want something Frontline not near as well cuz they don't have to do can go in first without Duncan zillion to let Camille does yolo in and make it okay that's been banned away ever since game when I think they need somethingdo front lights and play My Life For Hire let's keep butt around me Nautilus stoneplate he's not as Tanki Guardian handle Aftershock to get some more Frontline but this is a very squishy team for TSM there are so many good targets for Leona for Acero 4 orellana Shockwave and now the question is are you okay with a pressure or are we going to put that on and give solo counterfeit Gateway just come at you nonstop that being said from behind against a very different story then it is again that's going in Scales incredibly well can just straight-up get to the point where he is killing you very very easily in that side length is also drafted alongside that require a lot of back line access fee don't think of Mark having that back line access one up and over the top is a grave Dalton it over the top is this an altar for the added damage for the durability that the shield will provide to some of these divers and it's going to be up to fly quest to try to disengage send this to try to lock down to these carries burslem out because as you said they are very squishy and they're susceptible to the CC if you jump in there is a Camille and you get immediately Leona combo Shockwave. By the Oriana you will know live very long you want so game 5 is coming and solo he's probably left on the island of his magic is good it looked up Diamond 2 + 2 with you when getting play Quinn's 1/2 more percent more than would be expected based on Champion win rates so is going to feel pretty good will see the top of magic Ken gowell otherwise we are on board game 5 of the LCS finals I am so happy we were brought all five games here and now it is down to Blind how well can all 10 players play is a trophy number 740 s m or oflike West Point Thayer Banner for the first time in LCS history we will decide here today over the next 30 minutes this is a spicy level one I'm itching to see how hard they commit to this but so far this is so smart from solo so this was a planet date for a top laner he's going to be waiting and try but she doesn't leave it could be what is seen the word go down like two seconds like no one else around or fine but you're right people were coming right that was about to kick you to stop the recall yeah I feel like solo could have stopped it pees on division little babies solo didn't know how close the rest of them were and what was worried about a bait but with all of us may be a possibility to Atlanta by Frost anyway it was Much Ado About Nothing good positioning from solo strong bit of foresight there to be sitting back if you are at the dry brush which is the most common kind of loved one position as a top laner you just died about a date because we're conscious of behind you TF2 walks around the corner and with that gold Garden all of a sudden it's like well that sucks so good preparation of both sides the level ones haven't amounted to anything in this you know we we expect a lot from loved ones from black with especially they look really good with the preparation they're both teams did try some stuff in this one but nothing really came from it about series late or early play comes in nice Tracy's going to take some blows back as well turtle eggs are feeling comfortable enough so he will be the squishy your version if there's a lot to be hot they can burst him if he'll come see about that one regardless the trades go back and it is still fly crust with the landing lead so far but to the point about late playoff series is not only do you have a lot of tape to say hey to have any bad habits level one but also if you have not had a couple 100 surely some team would have already cut with use that end in your bad habits would have already been exposed by 7 to take you down and semis were in court or something else and so yeah okay I'll say Taurus reach out of the bot Lane they are setting up what could be a potential by the murgu of Aftershock Leona and they could look at this is my city is 3 enough to kill the next Viking is here where the thumbs-up Evo black was with the huge start the game 5 for men play doubt it at bottomley level 3 mid later shows up level 3 shows up they have a tank Yuliana a lot of the early shots in he goes straight onto biofrost pop tonight to pull aggro hit the cute and follows with me Flash's out avoiding that last PowerShot N2 you're trying to get that final bit of damage down to it for its surviving with almost no health and that is not a TV bottling you died at your tower that with the wave pushing biofrost and Douglas will be in trouble from this spot you come back and you have a pi of a of a Mana crystal that's it unlocking to look pretty nice girl in Aflac Westside seven to eight hundred gold lead of a longsword comes in feels wonderful in India there's no first I want to know if not more than 800 gold so it's not like I was getting the money what are some good Champions write your texts not a bad early-game chance to get money on get your your item across soon as possible to help sore farmlead help you pay some Drake's and obviously while total getting 300 that's going to feel good as well so fly Quest writing well over in game five let's not forget the Broken Blade he's got a TF Midland and he's on Camille this is a lane that decent can crack open in the mid game it is what the bot lane from SIA Santa's got to be able to withstand the onslaught when you get for me and I have that early it becomes very very difficult Leona is a champion that can be oppressive from ahead you're so much additional armor know with that W active plus the Aftershock and makes you so tanky gives you the ability to pull off. I would like that especially when you are setting up or those guys with the set solo a little bit of this striking back on the top side so now the trade come to the bottom yet again but an easy Escape biofrost jumps around the shield and yet and that was a little bit agreed there from solo stay around with no Mana low Health above and beyond the kills himself himself also had to pick up sapphire crystal has his recall probably couldn't afford the Ruby and it means he's going to try to use fan but he is down 16 CF and it's not going to get better got the door and play for a little power here but this is dangerous he's sick that he had she'd there is still potential is Camille at this point is gold a Michelle going to feel good Center on the force is playing right bottom side they are going to stack that Drake in the early oceans right that's going to feel pretty nice bit of missing health regen can help to keep some of the bad matchups afloat but it's still a long road ahead look at how aggressive Broken Blade is in empowered to get this weed gets done until off off two of those, or may yet have exactly an Audi RS6 so if you're thinking get The Pusher or go missing from that lane to get the very dangerous you can see santorin knows this witness wave crashing solo has got to be calling hey they could be here to dive me they could be looking you can see Oriana moving up you can see set moving up there were expecting the potential other than I but in this case get them is not actually looking to play for that you're so I believe was grabbing blue it looks like you went over to the side or perhaps just faking or move toward stop laying down to spot the Red Bluff when it comes up when Center and try speaking to come to the vision that they have in this could easily be 3 man talk it again open Torch Light for this one we know the middle and I can show up first as well read. Can be attack Tia sent with just all the top pressure in the world I got to go for a bus to you I think this is really smart, Tower texture resources elsewhere so they take away the crugs they're going for this red and they're both of those camps easy peasy couldn't even look to try to go over towards others Raptors and take away some more as long as Dirksen can maintain this push you're not going to lose that what they want is a red bump with Graves upper level on Pandora and the blood came through and Central got insist on the other but it is still like 3 Camp lead for speak a hundred gold for rent. Fields pretty nice have roughly make up for the money earned any way to not an easy target and weathering the storm to a late is right now is equal see at the cross before despite the fact too long swords and boots and now it's your two boots and you're even on Farm after getting form and over at level two I think I'm just a very impressive Landing a front of the CSM Duo to be able to play This Plane to a stalemate from that spot if not an easy task DSM have been as you're not bleeding more killed out in all this is our backup doublelift biofrost they've got their flashes I got the heal backup only cleanse wasn't used still waiting for that one the first time that he needs to so far so good 300 gold diapers and some of that is out the back of Gangplank printing free money on the side of course the F does the same we will wait to see you in the first result comes to review switch over to ignite from the Spellbook I might find him in one of the side lengths soon so is honor awardees ETrade comes in there's a thunder of the first you is the lot of damage, so he's got a hard time he could come in and it does so indeed how to fill a lady's got the work he's got no way out he drives a slow but the flash while I was there and broken play Top Lane Ward's potting soil the walking up the face check that brush she knew it was coming to point-blank hook shot come through he chases them down gets the kill solo an outdoor ultimate do teleport do Flash and you have a Sheen to be up there who's going to be able to fully reset this way of habit pushing toward them and this is going to be danger for that Gangplank because for the next minute or two here is his way of sorts of push away here to be so susceptible to a potential TF tank and it might just be a battle of top different sources bottom difference yet whoever the 10 it was 98 coming out of the series on 22in to of this one and now.
can anyone figure something out here against Team Liquid flyquest is obviously had a lot of time to try to strategize against them but Team Liquid has been on such a tear of late in a winning I believe $16 last 17 games they are crushing it I've been extremely consistent but and we have heard in some of the interviews flyquest feeling confident against him liquid and they did show us some pretty creative Champion to lakhs in playoffs so far and I'm I'm pretty interesting to see if they can find some sort of way to going to use that to their benefit because I do think if there isn't it for flyquest he comes in the draft we seen on 10 to 15 a lot more creativity picks from all around the world are our kind of being injected into the nav meta and I think likewise maybe we can take advantage of that but if we can of course we know that he liquid have the small of champion. Joan of the LCS so far that's going to let them to a first place regular season ends there best record ever spell for undefeated in the playoffs could well poised to bethe best team liquid we have ever seen in this is a team that won four straight sweats just two years ago so the question is how well can they do with Rookie of the Year tactical and how much can there new head coach in jet leave the way for the squad they can see a lot of Carrie Focus truckers are off the table in the Evelyn is exceptional we know how it is around there as well as a top sandals like that one is left up impact then a left up which is a pretty big deal here as well and you're very kind of crop in Caitlin Ash in the botlink there is well then maybe the first picture I mean if you're willing to do a trade if your happy playing both sides of the matchup it doesn't really matter if you can go to wear something like this in and try to force solo to play something that could punish the chat but honestly that maybe not as easy for us to do because they generally leave Solo in a more kind of plane tweet side of the map anymore with stanza matchups though you generally the match of the actually punish at are things that require some attention some protection from your jugular they do grab that set they have been very very keen on it overboth top and jungle and using it as a flex between do we have not the power of evil play I don't expect that we will but you know this is probably more of a jungle pick and you know I would love to see solo go towards something like you know the GP perhaps or even going to be a p options such as you know Casio and Vladimir that can do pretty well into the gym so we got a really really big put a top tier Champions right now because a lot of Savannah cat breed of it targeted at various layers indeed acronym is in we are still on pain from nurse the outlet Nerf the Caitlin there's none of those are in on this patch I still think acronym is a top top tier Champions and set or the number one in two chance across all of pro play in this patch I think spend and pepper the objective Lee actual best jungler and toppling ass personal opinion and Ash Road alongside I mean I love both of drastic very strong I'd still like deals Champions morethis is a new pic for cl so we'll see how rocks is going to be able to Pilot it it's a lot about not just those pics in isolated about the combo shrimp is a very very powerful backline diving combos I'm going to be in to see if TL want to drop more dive alongside them you off into the back line with the heck room to Shen Stand United on top of you you get right on top of the 80 care if you're the one with the ultimate into a taunt that could be a very very tough combo to deal with for wild turtle on this Caitlin and that is kind of what they're looking to do I will say though and generally speaking hecarim need to stay ahead of the pace of the game hacker I'm playing from behind it's generally pretty difficult to succeed so we may see broxah try to really power Farm because hecarim does have a great clear I like the Morgana been here though there is not parody in the picnic bands as know we have potentially jungles match and popping 40 L support Pick 4 flyquest and they could ban up with Tom can't hear as well if they wanted to knock some more of those safetyI'll pix to be paired alongside that Ash but how you could also be worried about something like a bar if you want to deny play making but will be the time can I look at the TLC Squad is that they are very physical heavy shed at the physical damage stop When I Was Your Man ask for the same for their respective roles but they were just living use number 2 in damage here in playoffs so far so I'll just you can easily bring into magic damage bit later in case you're worried about flyquest front lines. And armor and most likely stand for in sexy pretty good right there we'll see what they're toppling traffic is going to be because at this point that's like Wednesday to toppling bands against them they can counter pink top and they can wait in kenefick bit here as well if the foreign to them they dropped off the bands to make sure the Caitlin thrash can be an unanswered bottom light could look very good and Lena cases like Mystikal to drive to write my guess is they just go on and you know what I do think that you could go towards Vladimir or something like that but you know I'm not sure that they're willing to play that sort of a styleit's more of a you know step away from the kind of pics if they have been comfortable in doing more to Kaiser in GP are the two strong matchups in the shed that like with his already shown so that's why those are getting bad out but it is going to be the azir line so obviously has some sort of conditional counterpick they want to see what else Team Liquid has in store before they do go for it and that is to be pretty interesting but I but I will say I'll be up at this morning for black West if it's just like elastic Renekton Oren and you showed your bed lamp or nothing but it looks to me a lot of this like it is why I was really trying to push down in the jungle is Neil yeah I mean could easily happen there as well to take him still moves they want to wait for that one little bit longer on top of the supposed to be spicy your pic but you know that band out all the big talk like an event which has a band out roxiticus Champions they took away and band way Jensen stop to hear as well as going to put him onto his second a colleague of the yearplay Austin the most important that so far this year and it's going to be boss to call in which we have some very very well across the World Champ really is in we did see a pretty impressive game from Jensen in his akali game he was 9 0 and ate it was against The Mortals I will say in that game despite chance of having a credible individual performance Team Liquid did look less comfortable though because it was such a a different style right they didn't have that a z or orianna going to play front-to-back is a different style of game that you have to play out it's not just the change from Jensen Beach Jensen was fantastic with the flaxen I can find a good angle to get to work that back like and it isn't that could be that last pick 4 in here so I will say I'm pretty disappointed with the pick order from flyquest I do think that there's no reason you can't just blind that and then allow power be able to get some more preferential matchup know perhaps you would have preferred the Oriana or something along those lines into the akali and what does generally deal with the trout a lot better soyeah that is something to consider but good playmaking Encore JJ you know he's going to be over on that blitzcrank Blitzkrieg thrash is an interesting matchup you can actually try to time your hook it with Retros for a hook you can hook in the thrashed actually Target him so a lot of playmaking ability hear a lot of engage and I40 L they are moving outside their normal Comfort Zone in this first game against like West all right well Champs are locked in Jensen the LCS leader and most games played on a collie we're going in for game one let's get it startedwelcome to summoner's Rift for game 1 of the supper bracket final best-of-five the winner of this VO5 the first one to knock down three next I will be in the LCS summer finals they guarantee they will not be in the play in stage at world twenty20 that they will not have to face DSM for the right to get back to the final itself loser of course is going to face TSM and we'll see what happens if that one is they Battle of secure second or third and we're out of the rift here with fairly standard spread out teammates and opponents and wait to see what comes out of this game is to be phase Rush ghost tech room here so he's going to be a very quick horse that there is some debate on on should you be on your face rashyou be going in a conqueror or even Predator a Time some people who go to Ward's I think these rashes is just incredibly strong it's something that not only has as a utility in combat but people are are really starting to recognize how how strong can be even defensively to play towards Vision you know if you are the sacrum and you're going to lose out an extended one we won against the set you can still move into the river try to sweep out towards our place downtown where did your own and if you do run into Mickey's the phase rush for retreat do I have a lot of utility there a frost it is going to be starting your over on the Rafters you can do this solo start very very easily because of the alien macaron you have a really strong clear on all of these multi-target camps in getting that burned down with a Talisman and keeping yourself fairly healthy Terry farmlead year is Centaurus going to say yep we clear the war comes up says yeah you would know there is no waybecause the very minor least they can tell the start of the Jungle but that is only going to be a guess you can question mark pains right now from the team liquid sites in the Eastern jungle saying well if he's normal passing he might be read the blue of course early-game set is a single Target Camp Champion you want to do red blue green red blue and it becomes something that I really want to point out here to flyquest it has been so good with their level ones in their pregame planning this is another entrance to that because as you say you're not only is it that you would have to guess on the side of TL where he was they had award in the tribe rush in the river that would have actually covered that path and then at the time and where Brock The Cook's Nook around that word of gone down through the bottom line try brush up the word the blue Buck ignore moved out of Lane immediately to put award there so they knew exactly where Brock's it could have come from what timecould have been there at and because of that before it has full knowledge that he stole the way that I can see all of his camper still remaining and they will get a significant lead off of again really smart passing from santorin really clever early game planning and warding off yet those words did not come into play this game but they had both sides both exits and pasta broccoli could have possibly use and I just speak how intelligent they are with these These are the game jungle starts and Team Liquid don't tell Ford we will figure it out eventually and right to recall off and is down at most one camp now sees their constant hey at some point this guy run around and took my top jungle he's got his chickens back fairly soon is not going to be a death sentence for broxah will getting a recall off he's totally fine overall but is the state we are in right now for Central and got to get the camps you wanted and did the lead will extend from your rightknow what once you clear out these camps and you start having nothing to do is the jungler that is when said is going to be pulling ahead because that is going to have extra cancer meeting on his side of the map he also has while options of where he would go but Santorum still not recalling his Exodus sneaking down here on the bottom line is down there. Very well done temp from fly bites because had that built over Peacemaker actually connected I do believe it get the killing blow on corejj so very aggressive passing gear unlikely that you would expect that down there at that time and didn't spot him with hot shot they didn't really know where he was and he hadn't even recall the app so does get a little bit of a farmVantage to be able to blow some the sun goes down there you're so many pretty happy with straight overall because both of flashes are available there for wild turtle in eggnog and this is going to be play aggressively or Potter aggressively whatsoever in this to be to now because if you have sec with you know set an in thrash and exotic ways that though unfortunately that one regardless we can take a look at the various lengths as you mentioned the jungle difference will grow over time spent for and got a gank off and his own first three colonies up a camp right now with very little left of the Akron to do he'll cycle back to his chicken pretty soon in the middle and we've got equal for McQueen use liners both of them level six in the Top Lane he must be exact same boat here so very very close gave one sonas expected and we'll see if like West you were the kings of First Blood to get that happen to this game again you that little Shadow revealed and then you can actually try to Auto her by doing a minion and then having the soldier stabbed Brew in that small line in a weed to actually connect to call is over there are some ways to a taxi Hollywood he is here in this matchup even when she's in the Shroud call the also has to be worried about any potential is your ultimate the scooper out of the Trap flyquest do on this dragon look up he'll be able to finish it before tal gets here before just to be back in helps it to Beaver's butt in first reply Quest doing this a lot of checking cannot get it you flashed in and could not find rock them for one second kill in his fight and I'll Fly Awayit is to Destin Florida toll both dropping the flight but dies it with just a hair of HP there fairly

I'm not either anyway Team Liquid had an eight-game winning streak in one of the series ever LCS finals 50 record the series out incredible play so far tour the first time at Worlds the third see if I can do season look at makes one keep on going to lose the gate one stay on Blue in the band look office Emily but they did make finals in Spring we have to remember that they got a year if you think about them naked as a finals in both splits you know this organization I think I was really just had such an incredible year that both as far as performance and branding and everything like what has been having an amazing time Team Liquid obviously a slip in spring back to their winning ways it feels like in summer but they are looking to do more than just perform in the regular season they want to win another shipif they had won four straight prior to Spring and that is kind of their base line with expectations they are going to change something up here is not that first picture sent it will be toward the Caitlin I expect all over the den that make sense now I'm curious if Team Liquid will then grab the Border Keizer or GP right here that is kind of what I'm expecting and I'm expecting TL to not play the dive comp I think they're just going to go back to how they were playing in the regular season in which is front to back to you buy more like what's like west-style was you know so you could go for something like DP Oriana and just play front-to-back Slow standard team v v v v that Team Liquid is so good at dannemora Kaiser I think makes a lot of sense it was between this and GP for me so not really surprised whatsoever I'm definitely seeing what's coming through now in the Trap like was putting an increased priority on to the has ears thing it's really important to keep this off of gun to his most plates and split by far with something fix is azir for Jensen if he of course a great team fight madeself pops off the oil Oriana House of Citrus County Road okay last pick 4 TL have been and of course Oriana was on the table the whole time to make game ones, Patty flight opposite of a dive comp and the day they now have the organic here as well and of course I think you have the ant with apps you have to grab that before it's too late otherwise the 83 treeless drops off a cliff and so this is always the lock and I think unless you're willing to go down to like the gin or whatever or you want to play something people regret losing her Calista baby but that really doesn't feel like like my style so everything's going very much to expectation I would say especially on TL style and something I do think that they are individually very proficient on these different style Champions like Roxy piloted the acronym well in Jensen's a great akali but they're 15 as a hold with less comfortable when they are playing that stylemake sense to see them just go back to the way they have one for years and years front back 5 V 5 flag Quest may just want to try to ban out Morgana tahm kench go to words with fresh again and that was very successful for them last time but of course Team Liquid would have the last band you do to be able to answer that with a fresh band if they are at all concerned about that pic because it was very successful in enabling ignore to to really get things done anything to see if you look with respect peppermint the best jungler in the game and I'm going to guess they have screamed at for throughout the back half of the year and ended early playoff setup as well because hecarim has not yet been seen us entrance Champion full but is vandeweghe here by tle course they really picked it flew to 3 in the first game there is well torrent Central and drops off the Olaf engraved yeahis also really really strong combo in the first game as well just wondering are they most concerned about the dive they are going to take away the thrash Tomcat was left up so it wasn't necessarily what flyquest was that she going to be looking towards but things like Lisa still available is a favor for both of these guys but they're actually not grabbing a tie in the last riseI think I think looking for for sumterville Opening match of 4th and 4th I think it is and that is why they're not going to go for the sit here and he said I think it's strong is that was with enable pretty have Levi's the thrushes well with a no entrance into a lot of these gangs Caitlin wachs I really like this is incredibly powerful great that's that played in Pro play maybe just in the game. Right now. It has so much zoning especially when you're going up against The Rock on work on as almost nothing to this Lane without gagging distant you can't just go in and if Lain if it has bush is so incredibly hard to Lane against because if they get to push what they will do is go set of traps on one side of the tower feel drop the Lucent Singularity velocity on the other side of the Tower and you just have nowhere to step without being harassed have nowhere to step to safely Farm if you try to squeeze past the Gap in a trap you can usually get hit by a finding it is going to be bald hair for box that's a pretty safe standard Southwe could see something like the Kindred if he wanted to go for you know something that is Maurice Kealing pick and has a bit of an advantage here cause it's whooping interesting you know for the added dive alongside you have the same United on the closet to have the recondo come through I've been seeing this pic play some indie LIC as well as in some of the other regions that there are a lot of squishy members over on the team liquid side generally causes feels pretty feast-or-famine to me but I do think alongside work on and Shen Yue have the dive buddies they are you have the ability to to get going in this game but it does feel like it would be pretty difficult to win any sort of a 1D one against the Volver who is going to be tanky enough going to withstand your birth and no has a pretty strong clear himself see what I can get done with this it is going to be his first play on the champion this split and I'm trying to remember if there's even a single kha'zix play in the ALCS this split I tend to think I want to but we could get it confirmedEvan one here there regardless of anything to get last pick for a scent wanted to play kha'zix into this one I want to see if TL can be split up enough that he can find the isolated damage cuz it's is good because of the eyes with a Q dealing more than double damage their on targets and yes of course get that one to happen of course the Pegasus could be good as well you got Fairly reliable CC in a couple of slow so we'll see if I can come through We R Who We R fat composition for LCS finals in the last 5 split a blip in Spring but back of the top performer in summer can they do it again is the question meanwhile flyquest on their way to Navy or second LCS final and their first-ever title if they can keep this one going and we are going to have this upper bracket final match happened here today like what's a team liquidgoing to be a good one mean if it's like most wins this game it's just get them so much momentum in the series you know they have I had the ability to bring out some kind of fixing some unique Champion Select already in playoffs with some of that this might be fixing to the power of evil so you don't want to put them in a position where they kind of just take a swing like that no Team Liquid back on Comfort they need to perform here I think in a settle down the nerve see if they can really run over this game and I do think they have the ability to do that through bottom line because I think this is such a heavily favored to V2 towards TL side really the only chance that is you know post sick looking for an Engaged or having the jungler come down and finding you know flashing gauge on 24 JJ and tactical because work on dad's almost zero in the TV 2 and Watson and Caitlin are to the strongest Lane police in the gameyeah I'm looking up what could have happened here as we get the year of the Jungle starts and of course Angela get the red pretty much instantly knock down things like for the Raptors pretty easily but I think it's so absurdly TL favored supposed to work in and you know what congressional world are the champions of balance is okay you've got to think on the other right but it flips whatever the engage is good if you have damaged to break through the shielding but this is Premier plus this is absurd and he's running Guardian is just incredibly fairly strong and I just means that there's a lot of damage really on the rakan + Ash to actually break through a lunch you like that you are engaged to go okay light binding and we don't lose any help so nice engagement and it gets even worse because he's out thereOllie's it before they gave Susan Collins all the things you have to do to you have a chance at working plus Deluxe is playing he'll do they have cleanse over on on tax bill so the Ashera wasn't going to be as silly as effective and there's no Keel over on the on turtles because he has to respect the TDCJ number of any sort of mining in traffic on those because if you don't have plans and you get if I won binding that full combo can just need that little rain cleanses fight a car has no potions already tried to fight 4 minutes out of the turret socialite lighting to Caitlin McHugh Auto and that was really gone right there and not going to steal back heels back up 4:40 and 4 to take walks out of it says I mean I'll just you know do 40 damage to you it's still the more defensive option to play run all living but I mean Corgi just Shane Farm Gold by just using spellthief's and just now go for the rest of this option it's fine I'm just not capable exactly if you think there's no way that they can actually went in and out without a bill to go for you know when you can look for thoseUW trades wages Shield himself locks board and it's like was traded to the shield they're going to lose that pretty heavily you can see the beginnings of what I was talking about here let me see an earlier levels you don't have enough traps to fully cover the line but rap on each side send a WhatsApp to cover the hole gap on the left side of that Tower meaning you can't both avoid the Poke and actually Farm Heroes wildturtle and that's where you have to try to start squeezing around the traps you open yourself up to potential finding it just becomes incredibly difficult I mean they lost the Torah play on like the second wave so it's really tough for knocked it downall right well we keep on going to this one is still have the early lead and farm is + 9.2 because Turtle can't last hit everything underfoot it's hard to say no to help overall he's going to walk around with some more covers himself may be as far as first three calls coming through on a couple different sizes and the final recall it comes out of the mid lane by Jensen if he comes in for both sides going to be a different piece to want to point out how are people I believe was not comet in game 1 musical Tempo switch over to comets we can do more poke here in his one-on-one get to Blaine apartment still get to get a bunch of Mana through his room choices in this matchup he knows that Jensen will be able to trade back playing arrange restraint match up here so he does want the comet to be able to come to compete with that folk a little bit more it is also confirm that this is actually the firstkha'zix the split so I was right with that one and and santorin know we'll see how well he can't perform in as I said it has been played in other regions but first time in LCS display. To see in central one who has been a very team have a jongleur first blood king of the league spent a lot of time here is his support and rest of the team as well do what you can do on this assassin currently down 1 calls come through a red light with a long sword it moves on and of course this first break is alive and fertile you'll have it for a good move to the right to get him out but it does mean the Bronx is forced to run for his life and when you have the upfront person the fight starts looking pretty bad for Center on the reason Proctor really has to run it because he knows that ignore is there, there is a spot in the Eastern NC on the flank there but if he gets spotted I meanCork and evil and a cute wake up the dragon dragon off the back ignore probably died so I will probably. All right well he is able to get out of there so far no pretty calm game here and Jensen but impacting to take down top schedule what about later okay XP needs more time because I'm a gold 14 Tire Gate Court was on cool down so he was just trying to get priority there but because of the cracks me up gently didn't have to baste so you're not only did they get that sell crab because in fact move down and we had control the river was able to go for any fruit boxes moving over here though we'll probably just try to help him around the side is your tickets load put toward down see sent over that box light off they need to push it over with p o e be offended that a little bit more they could have potentially set up a free and forced Jensen to stay around because the reason broccoli come there is is obviously yes he told him to go to kill but really realistically you're just trying to push in the waves allow Jensen to reset because Justin has no teleport at NoMa can aloe help so he needed to go back to base and that's why they tried to get it pushed into the tower there maybe 5 play that little bit differently and try to defend that a bit more aggressively because I didn't have shockwave and because he didn't have much help I feel like they might have been able to pull that off on the day is going to be the case where Team Liquid her up 400 gold and plus a pick axe pick up hours but you can see
bites unless I'm really excited actually see the draft coming in the game 3 year we saw Team Liquid go for this sort of dive comp in Kingdom blunt they went back to go to the tried-and-true front to back to you fight style in game ever they dominated black West was the one trying to dive and attack into that game so now I wonder what they were dozens will be here in game 3 they are on the blue side Shen getting banned out so that is going to be a first in the scariest thing I've traded this back and forth but Team Liquid with a constant attack toward santorin in pickup bed is in Banning out this Lilia and Eve by consistently Warren has been no really really one of the best junglers in the league and he has a very big champion pool in a 1/6 for the first time last name is Love For the First Time all series as a result now it is a champion we have seen at what out of town all summer long it's Roxas most play if they are concerned about the championfirst take on a flight quest in a Champion Auto V Sentra has not shown us a lot I'll be so yes Caitlin is free both cake here but it also is a TL can add a third Jungle Band and honestly I don't think I've liked was is going to be worried about the Lisa and I know the frocks is is an incredible lease in player but if you'd like what is going to play the super slow style I don't think that you have to worry so much about police and it's not as stealing monster is a playmaker but I'm not really the pic I think that they are most concerned about now because of the scaling the farming ability we are not going to have the ass coming through it is the gym which I do think can answer the Caitlin some people is kind of talked about it as it as a Caitlyn counter I don't believe it to be that you know I've watched quite a few Pro matches now with this matchup and I definitely believe unless there is a severe support mismatched the best of the Gin is hoping to do is get push against the Caitlin because of gin does have fairly good waythere is going to come and we'll see down to can you actually sidestep to build over peacemakers can you avoid those and just try to keep this Lane in equilibrium all right well even though Jen has been picking up in 30 especially in the LPL actually crossed those League's top forties how did I get to win rate so far with Caitlin steak in a 55 and fro play that can be of course. But still want to bring up to your ass like when he's around out there first three up with a band phase comes through they were going to answer could be going to go ahead and say that I think Morgana movie fantastic here now helps to get you the push as well as the support of any sort team who could have a winning bought Lane to be two again I do think is important for dinner play from Ed Gein of course with the xq damage known that for a shot you want to be snowballing you want to be pushing the pace of having that additional gold did does traditionally really struggle with killing tanks so if like West Coast volibear plus something like Warren I do think the TL is going to need someone to really help to do that deal deal damage to front line mordekaiser can do that some what is not really the best Tank Killer and it seems like generally speaking but I just pretended health HP damaged obviously with the passive plus you're in beef building until the injuries which is really going to help the burn through any HP that the bulb Baron attention or something like that would be stacking my annual fee how much they could do against the front line there was a mordecai to comes in the Orange's Banda right away get rid of the wrong tanks are banned as well they have increasingly early on in these rest and then have gone ahead and I will be back to do band away but it feels like that's going to be likely on their side and we need a mid and support on the TL side we need mid and top on Aflac Westside they cannot guarantee how to fix both roles we know if Worthen countertop side but I don't think that's a good movie that's like what answer though you can go towards that beat them or Kaiser when is blind such as the Jacks but I think I'm more likely to be the GPS actually like to see TL fan that out is comfortable playing into the mordekaiser and it's also a good matchup in the Border Kaiser I'll Renekton is another one that no does have a pretty strong answer to that Mort in the 1D one but to me this is just like we should go GP go heavy damage mid laner that they're going to be normally going forward like he is here or the Oriana or the Cassiopeia depending on what they want to play and I think I'll put them in a really really good situation at the border guys are blind did feel a little bit weird to me because I think you're losing out on the potential of getting that Morgana early clearly they may be wanted some more guaranteed engage maybe they were never going to go to that Mordecai that Morgana anyway Zyra is something I've been wanting to see perseid it is it's such a good lading Champion you really can dominate in the to be to the amount of Pope you have to push you have with your cutest even on the Range been in similar to Karma can be incredibly powerful but you are very susceptible to his gang so you have to be protected on that bottom side with this heavy push Zyra also functions welding team fights against mail a Pantheon new shipments like father and thrash that are going to have to be walking through your altered plants that is very difficult for them to be able to do that being said if you can land a hook on them it's going to work rate like what's going with what was my expected tax you know as a sad is Jerry quarry on a GP I think this makes a lot of sense for them they are looking front-to-back Team Liquid they are fairly AP heavy right now I do feel I think we're probably still going to get magic damage-dealing mid laner muchin middle Zone almost let me know how to attack, it is a peacock is a very very very very good pic into his ear he simply cannot close the gap on you he doesn't walk very fast do you land a folk from forever way and to be clear flyquest engaged to Schriever Shuffle and otherwise everything is outside of a ranch outside of those ranges so this is a fairy poke heavy Zyra is well to play around Jensen and tactical down to the bottom side it's it's such an interesting composition write it and again I think that it can match up well we just have to seek ntl play this difference South because this is the second time now in the series they've really departed from their kind of standard lots of tanks and back by damage and just front to back this is much more of a poke style of gameplay where you're going to be throwing down the general 380 Spokane Caguas is poking Non-Stop and you're just trying to kind of overwhelming importance of lice kill shot that they have to die if you miss position at all on a comp like this is incredibly Chief gets swept in by the aesir get hit by hook or anything like that things can go bad quickly so I'm excited to see how TL really does manages, because I do think these are some pics we should be seeing more of the ALCS I'm going to be really excited if they can really pay dividends for them it's going to be really interesting Team Liquid add two more unique Champions to their pool the first kog'maw game of the split for Jensen the first gen game of the split here for Rookie of the Year in tactical that's going to be exciting to me it's one of the things that we gave to your criticism for was very very shallow Champion pools not from his whole lot of difference that said even with a constraint pool is enough to take first place in regular-season best record ever had their Po-Boys to maybe do the same thing here in playoffs was there run there as well that they add more to the pool at the upper bracket final just saying hey there's more threats to care about boarding students to consider Banning as they're up against their toughest competition gas and black was looking for a sneaky little one year and saira off and goes to Lane to get seeds down in the lane to set up the push and because of this if they can actually sneak around here for JJ could Dive Level One okay book from the brush is not good enough nice try but he decides if the whole time around if that lands for is pretty much always dead end of the day to get nothing not going to be able to find it I like the attempt though that is 100% of Justin based on his Ira because if you want to get push on his Ira you utilize your pasta to stand in the area and get those seeds to spawn you can do this for a good lease but in this case you know you walked Elaine you allow always seed to spawn and then your parts kit kat tattoo level one because you were dropped on the q's bumblebees plants okay if I didn't do that so that's what they were anticipating and that's what they were trying to counteract at the very least like was denied cordage a from being able to put down those plants in the bottom Lane so they're not going to have as guaranteed of a bush do it do still expect chiroplus gin to maintain that pushed in the early game and we'll have to see how flyquest can hold up here because there is a potential to all in but we have to kind of watch how proficient or JJ is on the stick because once it in Iraq that's really interesting about the Zara and one of the reasons that I think is it supposed to be a great match up into thresh is that if you are quick you can place at a plant in front of yourself and then immediately key for the instant spawn a plant that can take the thresh hook pretty much every single time as long as you hold onto a c and you're really fast you never pressed and you know it and you leave a second wc2 valable at all times you can eat W to block that hook as long as you pay attention to think what you said different words and we are on to the next Lane is he fits the cute down sponsor more plants because he's going to overdraw planted it got to take some very much but it's 30 gold that is some combat damage is feeling good probably going to be playing manaflow band I do expect you want to be stacking that up early as well will be interesting to see where he wants to go there are some different options as far as the styropek does go you do have to know to like when comparing two locks for a higher level of the way higher risk because it didn't really Shield this isn't Guardian know it's spell piece so no HP and no resolve to really going to keep you safe in that he is going as well for Domination secondary so he doesn't even have no gold plating or anything along those lines yep. But there's a possible to go back up yet quote for his primary and I hope he's getting movement speed on exhausted flashed when I get him away from being dosed is the primary target the easiest Target I would say on this t l comp overall I will see if they can kind of push him down or if you can keep the cat's going using landform broxah not going to fight Center it if it's not going to be a contest like if it has spells available he just dropped on his head and you've go into that you take the damage the shielding and his extended damage and self-healing does go, very we cleaner free 6 but post sick with the emacs you can pretty much it is to kill the backline very easily with Yuri plus one charge of that ultimate your way up there becomes very very strong and you know it's really level six and then honestly even that the later ranks of the ultimate workhog much does start to get an advantage because you are getting the longer and longer range on your ultimate and that's really where I got the power from the champion, we could have sold the top slide makes himself land of barrel chained Rock Atlantic you call now 28cf on US1 Jensen to go to the harsh of Maxi is you expect on a peacock shut the wave down no big problem here I can see is he recalling a deed was he was Guy okay he's gone no big deal where to get that reset coming through is again finished codex comes through, people once again for his range match up watch the way there. They might be able to chase him down but what's a girl team is for a cat is dead Lilo and got to be killing solo can't get more than single count back any base the counter take paroxetine with two but he does have CC and a wave is is looking pretty okay friend so we should be able to CP back and actually fix the way from celso infant likely still will lose more this was incredibly close though this does show just how to take keyboard Kaiser came yet grasped Rock Comes the Sun comes up for these don't quite have enough damage in Concord get stacked against the Safeguard his healing starts to come through in the first kill does arrive trial field coming across all so and solo just barely finishing them off with that final shoe as he went down that was so critical cuz he dies there and then that survived they fully reset the wave and he was as so much more instead they both got to kill he has a wave in his favor because he saw it until 4 and as a result is up a lot of farm 3 gold and a 3-second cool down your refund is the plant comes right it was faced it wasn't necessarily as a hook block better money from South landing and move back out of this game is Team Liquid are Up 3 to 200 gold from laying face I'll just have to kill being the primary part of that one is toplands up in farm and sent or in the same but hey kills a nice as well don't say terrific first is trying to put out the DL bottom line then he wants me for the schedule and sent you the tracking but he's trying to make sure that is gin darling could not actually push up in and interfere with take with, going back to face this will not be so goddamn it I wouldn't be a First Bank account until about 10 minutes Health Ade grabbed up an impact the Knights Play here's is hey you know what I do my timers you did a blue start blubaugh is going to be mine now you're doing Drake very very had left over that went over the wave
that won't go too much into that that potential match for that would be so spicy if it's TL vs TSM in playoffs with with some of the kind of trash talk back and forth between the old quad still able to reverse their Fortunes in this series if they can step up their play they can still take down flyquest and secure themselves a spot in the grand finals of Shield themselves pop to but the story of the series has been the teams that are mixing things up that are moving away from that team flight 585 hasn't been working as much I think I'm going to bed Kaitlyn their head back Hitler asked if it sent it I like this but I know the Alice has spent a lot of time over the State Farm El Fiesta I'm talking about hey you know Caitlin she's really big deal but the deer has been I think the champion of theso powerful has done much work on that champion at least asked if the only s t r a t carry left so to me it's not his first pic but of course he has valuable the Evelyn which TL finally leaves up is there something to look at here and TLC as well maybe we care more about callista something like the Caitlin Wright easier to play some the planes that do a party gauge and actually try to dive on the Ashen Punisher obviously the ashcan play with those lines if you can avoid that still has incredible amount of power utility I think it's while turtles best pick has been an absolute Smurf on the champion on this day for a long time very very rarely ever get caught on it even when they are playing it's heavy and it just build aggressively and never die so we'll see if that does continue for them this is the flex set I'm expecting it more likely to go to santorin but TL securing very likely have thrashedwhat's the thresh super standard bottom light very aggressive does have the potential to look for those two V2 kills I would be interested in flyquest want to go towards something like the Morgana but if they do that and TL go for the blind rise then TL control more advanced word power be able to try to secure a comfortable match up in that mid-length I all the rides over with his hair before and is the grass they want team fight engage question isn't there enough back light damage to back it up we know Justin can do incredible damage he's just not been on conventional team fight Champions almost at all in this series The One game he was on Oriana they want it so we'll see if he does that later on here I think it's incredibly High chances that doesn't plays auriana or cast Sandra in one of those style of Champions I would be really hyped for this for this long and it does get locked in so it is going to be up here for Santorum very exciting stuff to see how he can perform this is has been getting banned out non-stop the Evelyn can be incredibly powerful know Heather a relatively healthy clear your post 6 you do get that that passed them in this and it burst from my head is absolutely frightening you can absolute Shred the meat of Champions champions like the callista you have to be relatively short-range you can be putting yourself in range of that Evelyn to get assassinated and I'm just to be curious to see where else like what state does with their graph of the going to grab something that can dive alongside that Evelyn or they just going to have this is Evelyn kind of s as like a threat of her planking and taking people off and play the rest more standard because it was just the Evelyn alone with the set I don't know if they're going to have enough time to 10 still here to really run the backline consistently past threaten anyone and everyone sure I mean second try to go there you can try to go there but it's going to be enough is definitely question we've got for this game as LeBlanc and I thought there was a chance to sell it can be a think we've seen it occasionally though it seems very unlikely at this point Tom catch me to grab for safety the bottom side of her glands on a spring a right back out and you mentioned there is less safe Beyond ask there is on a Caitlin over the Tomcats clips that one no problem I just honestly it's because content you're committing to like such a passive defensive play style that there's no sort of follow-up that it has four and Evelyn and set diving forward the broth is not like this explosive support but at the very least you can jump forward throw your ultimate down give or ability to throw you know ccj and and and and try to help you with that potential. So I think it's more of a happy middle ground also can be fairly effective against that Calista jungle still has to be selected your 40 lb could go towards the heck room wouldn't be paired with the sheds they're not as all in on the dive but it doesn't open the door for something like a necalli if TL want to go that route I still think that we on it makes the most sense here you have to speed up for the heck room it's Absolute Comfort for Jensen it's securing some of that consistent damage in 5e V style of play. So that would be the pic I would go towards and if I were TL here it would be really interesting just leave them fairly low on consisted damage though but like I said that have the tankiest team so I'm not sure how much it matters in this does make Eva's job which is already hard that much harder because now you are single Target damage burst assassin here on the Evelyn and you died for it and you one shot that callista get revived that becomes extremely problematic you cannot just continue the fight is Evelyn you're really are kind of the staff here at 1 pick funny well Jensen of all Champs ever played more than 3 times a zillion is his highest rates across 13 games 85% this is going to be his make-or-break moment now again yes LCS playoffs are double elimination if they lose the series they play TSM who is going to the final possibility tlr not completely out if this happened to them but flyquest finally is allowed to play the Evelyn for power mobile see if we going to live Spain we'll see if we get a nice butt flyquest toys to cover the final from the upper bracket for the first time if they can do it here today and see if they could knock down to yell 321 it's going to be so interesting because the Oriana does have the ability to throw that ball over onto this Evelyn you have more access to word that back line now but at the same time on the other side if DL gets ahead if they're winning out in these skirmishes zillion + a zillion + Calista those are incredibly powerful combinations when you have the aura in front of you you have listed running around a thousand miles an hour you'll snowballing the game taking everyone down if she gets focused and burst out know that is easy to answer with Brazilian and that's why it becomes important to be able to land a damn it should be able to threaten multiple targets and that's where the shock wave comes in that's where you'll need to find more than one target they need to be able to Britain consist it damage rather than just the one. From and Evelyn because really can't do that too easily okay well we are live I'm going to see who could not going to land on the red team liquid on the blue when TL play conventional team fighting they want when they didn't they couldn't put it through Jensen on a tried-and-true Maids do not the typical scary looking to put a lot of rocks and tactical to be primary team fight damage output Calista tends to fall out bit licking how come tends to get a little bit the same there is some level of early game episode. Assistance but it is still a potential team fight for the first Thirty or so he's that could be an office like a fun to do a little late in the day they don't just leave her so if there is anything we had they will be out of War doing so I believe they snuck in and they want to invade right at 1:30 instead of punishing Red Bluff start I think they're actually expecting where you would start of it is leashless they are going to be here is split so we'll see if anything comes from the XP isn't the first Camp Trade It Back and Forth Ward they couldn't get enough attacks in and that means red getting cold and with the vision deficits like was can't take this fights of rocks it very slow as it got you for running across the map food and get little to himself with it and with orange 3-3 with Ash from Evelyn I think that is a really powerful at level one it is so tough to fight against Broncos at level one with a concussive blows there so if not I feel like Dave take a look at me more heavily to that but I get not wanting to be with your whole game at level one but that being said you committed kind of like halfway for this invade and it does this end up resulting in broxah getting into a couple of those little Raptors he gets his red Boston Health Barlow Trail and I guess they get Guardian off but that is skewed that is what feels like a mistake out of ignore toll to not be far enough back when those who's coming in but they didn't know what was going to cross their all late Tulane didn't have the breakpoint in mine it's not the level to power respect for evolution is Calista they didn't expect it but that's only you should always be doing when your parents are going to get level 2 with you can I can test it it could have been a scenario where they thought they can finish off the last minute and then get level 2 at the same time and if you fight it maybe they were feeling like that was the type of position they're in the end Sauders down for them for just the one over on TL do take a strong to be to match of the deal has and now that you have is for I'm really on the back foot and you can create the potential to to pick on him with a potential gain from proksa or something like that in this is maybe geekvape but in fact is that he attacked by sent for the got to play around the immune somehow get the knocked up for a crow not claimed yet every single time in fact I was first Blood you cannot take this site without Flash he dies in The Dive and that is gold to Team Liquid that's a disaster they really wanted to try to make it happen because it wasn't pushing wave charge you actually need to wait out this year in charge of that is the mistake here so you don't you don't take a crow until after he does his right that is what you're trying to do but because he punched him right as he comes through solo is being damaged during that Cece and it's what is not getting damaged during that CC so if you just simply walk up you put the charm on it with a W and then you threaten that attack he has to use during charge or he will just be Charmed up first right and then you have waited it out he doesn't have that you kill him after that CC expires and it's easy peasy Miss execute and as a result First Blood over to impact flash down on solo and that that disadvantaged you do matters a lot less because they killed Old going over I'm going to talk to my knee pretty close to hear conceive Team Liquid has a squad out of three to four hundred gold right now double cash credit equally across the board bot Lane early Advantage expected for the callista lane and there's going to be some Farm grab buy aspirin should still be a small deficit on the flight Westside -10 will be answered by about 7 is the wave goes down pretty good setup a big knot on a block in the shop but you can see how much damage is available. It's right there and not proxxon make sure the top-end looks safe with a controller to eat in fact is you can bring his Tepee a while ago so low now on Shield blocking but he is not going to live through this one gets us. Still going to drop and Team Liquid the more we killed her two nice punish their they know the Flash's down dies on the Dive Dive to the gag because he doesn't have Flash and because he died he didn't have a 6 as well and now no teleport the wave is going to be bouncing so much of his is lead is it going to be completely gone name that could have just been destroyed by flyquest because they lose their flash now impacted 6 office get the experiences and they go straight on ghost was pop gets right up on a solar solar with a nice buffer W there but it just doesn't matter the Orioles Matt had already landed you get knocked up off of that there's no way for him to fight his way out are you not supposed to go pretty good into tank the topside it may just not be enough here as you can see what the room is on the way but already done and some do for Sunfire cape and texted be comfortable for a while I have to feel like I will see if that moves on bed linens wedding farm back and forth we are actually not being the typical Evelynn build we actually on first recall Hugo dark sea lamp tell me if you don't finish this might till later because I'd like to schedule so hard of a PE ratios it's actually Alex got as well for your passive we had seen for decal deathcap first item pretty, as well I will see you this afternoon delight him first after the jungle enchantment but you're doing desk at first discover pass if you want to. Fall you like and we did see that the LCS that both games that they were on top of that there we'll see where are they touring does want to take us obviously jungle items completion is extremely efficient in a you are a little bit less powerful of course you know if you don't have that dark so early on, but he's just trying to raise the word that power Spike and we'll see if I can get anything done here because he is now 6 and this is where you really want to start making things happen that you can be ignoring that Vision just going to sneaking around trying to look for plays he is going for the invade beer they know the boxes down in the bottom side for the dragons so he can take away the cross and even the blue buff I think it's often up it back you could always look forward another dive but it is very very risky cuz if you feel that again it could be the surroundings have to wait it out goes for the three Charmed
online most team didn't want to avoid plan wanna be getting the better seating for world looking for better groups and chasing that Championship coming in from the other bracket of course if you really really nice for either one of the squad's why Quest got to be kicking themselves for not being able to close out that last game but tactical with a heroic performance and guess what first they get a vehicle is this like my friend off the board right away I'm curious how important in this draft how important Evelyn is in the grass because honestly be start with pretty good Caitlin remains off the table take a note from the other regions of the world in lck in the LPL in the LEC to Kaitlyn fan rate is 90% or higher only 16 by that one as wellat least Graves up as chance of rock so they could have been out the ass if they're concerned about that that would leave the Evelyn up to you know it as you are saying there is a chance okay to it immediately go ask them if your flyquest year was Santa band out that leads me to believe Tim would be looking for a gym after and I think that's fine but I would way rather have factual off of your high DPS Marksman is the ash put them out of the gym it wasn't as effective last time I've honestly pretty surprised if they're going to prioritize the crazed above the act because I do think that will give I think of you dance the bottom line for either team unless you have something really sneaky that you want to try to answer with maybe you want to go towards the other Lucian The Bottom Line we have been seeing it that we are really only been actually in the soul prior to the Buffs for Lucian we did the SS have a winning Lucian game out of the bottom line but no one is going back to it thenyeah and I think it's definitely an underutilized Champion overall but either way we'll see what comes through a first gen is liable a lot of things play Ezreal still though I'm not a really big fan of any more Champions out there that you don't want to go for that one 1/2 games on it was bandaging for an appeal take it away and game fine I will also say that Graves if you're going to if you're going to be like in orrtanna Grace is a good pairing for it because it's the idps jungler that can help them make up for some of the deficiencies in your kit the fact that you are more about the birth and less about the condition damage can be helped out I crave so if there's a parent to do with this doesn't make sense we obviously are going to be expecting something like you Oriana coming through from power of evil I would like to just see him grab it right now he's been so good on these Gilly Champions but they are looking like her prior to its worth with does thequick cook frozen band over towards power of evil try to cut him down a little bit and that mid-length yep I really do think there are a lot of viable Champions that pu we can play he's got stuck by Champion pullover all that I don't get the day was not able to do as much as solo who really took over on that set I would not be surprised if he said pick up again for black so good on it really realize that match it wouldn't be shocked to see a banyan with you to come through about that the kind of lack of attention to Morgana when it's been like a great first round pick before it gets bad but someone's always going to be an outside Crown Oriana could be taken away so that's kind of like it then for Aflac West as you say but I do feel like this game has been so much about liking team fighting and Oriana is one of the very best in that regard Oriana is deer know he can go to word things like Sandra he has more pics like LeBlanc but it's just not this as far as the team fight threat in the consistent DPS not by any means excellent on its overall as the NFL's mentioned we might want to see bar come through at some point but it does leave send her as a viable option that may well be the second band coming through based on the champion. OK AP kog'maw of course also makes sense as it is here, but it does mean that. Bindra is up it means Corky is up there there's a lot of people there are four key hasn't been seeing nearly as much play lately I think a lot of people are going to have a concert at the feels like it in the lady says these games but you know you would be running this kind of trouble by but perhaps it it makes things like tabbies and even though it's warm milk a little bit more effective in that way if you want high damage you can also go to something like a Casio but that does get out range by the azure pretty heavily so it can be difficult to actually close the gap and get the damage out they would like to do I even though Tabby is of course armors not reading at work yet still affects Auto attacks exactly is on so you don't love our Burgatory I wouldn't know we are effective syndrome support really well nickel pic but here here is my issue that my issue is generally that when you have ordered Volver already locked-in you can deal with Sandra is damaged just like getting out right like I actually don't think that's has a lot of fun killing Frontline so generally speaking is this is me playing the order of the volibear I'm just stacking helping armor and I'm just thinking that my health will be enough mordekaiser I do think helps erectile that's why I do like that a bit as a combination you can't really ignore Magicka damage completely when the mordekaiser is also parrot alongside that's Android because it on that now it's a double AP so Lanes as well as a depressant a marksman and the jungle so as a full pairing that makes sense than it does give you some early and make him priority but this isn't the kind of Campion that that really can dominate I think in the same way that you Ariana can buy it by like you're putting out all the damage of killing Frontline do these damn things you're really going to be more reliant on the rest of teammates to do that and he's good-looking worst kind of get Access Sports company's actual champion pics of bring back out they have a ton of people fighting Gates have a great backlight in a zero and a half of a black Westside it is a lot of CC as well the first is there but they are not all completely consistent team fight damaging was Jen does not do it does not do what his ear does and neither do mordekaiser but it is spread out if what dies the other three can pick up the slack the percent Health Payment mordekaiser brings out since you build Health that's fine to go armor that's okay it is going to help to force diversification in the itemization on the TL side we'll see if it's going to be enough still has been absolutely outstanding carry threat is like getting ganked a lot in the early again falling behind 0-2 he was a bigger Force overall in game 4 on the set is not another payment Champion here with the mordekaiser the old can go ahead and break the or adults we can't spend more people he can prevent spiders from coming through Play The Objective games can be excited watch I think so too in the end as far as DLC goes this is the most tlcup they could ever go for a right to essentially have to hide damage dealers for your marksmen for your mid laner a bunch of tanks in calendar for tax time you play front-to-back v e v that is how to yell. Where they are that is how they went on a 16-1 streak new playing this style like very few mistakes and just waiting sitting back fighting at dragons out to you fighting their opponents so they are fully in their comfort zone here they have a playmaking fork or JJ I think that is something that a lot of people have been really looking forward to seeing obviously did have some Playmakers drafted in this series but anytime he is on that far to just such a threat especially for Champions like gin if you ever look for an ultimate that's such an easy answer from the barges you have that down pat because you don't have a dash or anything like that you're going to be largely Reliant often times on the Thrush Lane turn to actually in void any sort of Bart ultimate for the engage yeah and it could be fun to watch what ignore can do on this truck because he's been I think a big part of life like us are good I do feel the entire team hits really well I think they're a lot of excellent players overall but it. Getting back on a playmaker is a big deal he's hooks are good as Lancaster good his watch play length of the jungler has been outstanding the man just has so much work to the fly Quest Squad and so him back on. Rob is really beneficial of course as much and so on the bar in a box of those as well and it really means we got big threats of Champions watch for on on every front here right toppling can be very volatile Odyssey see it a lot of gang set up it don't just want to show up there as you rinse in drunken obviously be huge game turning Champion as well so down the line exciting things to look at here every lane could be worth going to dissecting and spending a lot of time on because anyone could going to take that game of their own hands I agree and I think something else that's kind of interesting wrinkle here is that TL is often a team that likes to sit back in and give up early dragons and then can test as a third Dragon when they're playing this style of composition they want to get in their comfort zone They want to scale up and then fight there I think that style specifically becomes more difficult when you're playing at the mordekaiser because if you give up those first two dragons if your flight was getting to that comfort zone and then you go to get tested after drag your jungle gets more Dalton all of a sudden it's 0.45 Quest that can be potentially series ending well we are on the rest for the series ending game it's game number 5 flyquest and Team Liquid to look it up the back of their best regular season record ever number 1C heading into playoffs after winning for championship titles in last 5 splits are staring down the barrel being not to lower bracket by flyquest when I get right back to the second-straight LCS final third place regular season and second place finish in Spring overall see if they could do it here with Champions on the rift playing a fairly low risk style there is a deep word for impact metal tracks of the Jungle starts with C in figure out which side of the plate do to be really excited one honestly not much surprising as far as of the ruins or or starting starting set up here and be the only thing that I was a typical on the car feels funny to say it is actually the most out of fear of long time ago but they taste almost exclusively so even when you're against very non-threatening you thought that you could come running but he is going to have your higher first potential so you do threaten more of the hundred is gross style of singer that that you're always kind of worried about as an opponent to it but your survivability or got a Dodge out from Skillet Johnson and I think like that is is much lower with this style I want to take belt support saving one stack for the second way if you were thinking of going to take us to the turret that means use on cooldown his little bit of damage but trying to wave hair back and forth but if a little too not the hugest power Spike on all sides would have went out Breitbart learn a few at level 1 or you have to the sun didn't put a bunch of Health relics down for Jensen the middle and he went for Lane dominance but as the day goes by little to no big heart. Going to be equal Farm since like 11 to see if the 10th we can pretty comfortable down there been fairly strong later and none of these guys really going for a super laying down and support so I don't really see any big advantage on either side I do think it just mostly about skill matchup. Okay what do self-published picked up just fine I like that lyrics are wait until after Turtles W that is the correct to Place Lane out make your teammate mrs. kill shot is there big night was burned you was burning inside as well Sinners down mostly as well as damage goes in the process is he going to face it was brush I will stunt you a storm and we'll take this fight back if I bought me was over but it is still damaged his recall for that a rock that has both take their fists camp now Santorum looking to get box cutter with will definitely help the ability of his watt Lane to play aggressively and run straight through midline Power Wheel pushed out if he needs it doesn't look like he does he is going to get his double so good and I wonder if Vicki vack do that to me to put they have committed forward to the all then you know if ignore walk forward and actually took out both was hell trying well chords DJ was he see now because he doesn't have that to retreat back to you do you have the damage that you can shut off but that's always one of those really scary moments to try to commit all the way forward to that because of the volunteers behind them and then you could just really look silly people Temple asked you are going to Bentley dive in. X out and she's just throwing a 1.3 that's the second at you when it's not going to go very well but now it looks like the top side of the jungler is coming so nearsighted and that is a nice cake. A lot of time was spent on Camp lead and I'm going to feel good yep been feeling really good about that a lot of it on the graves to stop being efficient evil to win any sort of jungle dual if you run into your opponent taking can't consistently throughout you can see the rock that is going to be even try to take back these rappers get a little something for pain for ensuring on the top side of this is important because you did do double Scuttle and Brock that likely will be a bit behind as a result of that may be kept as you can in special because Santa run is now going towards the top side and rocks will let that little Raptor it's going to delay the response on those rapper Thrift in foreign quite a lot Aguilera forgot to Seagraves went around his left side Jungle Book for walls right now and rocks it to the Jungle grows very very early taking his life for this one you can see if they're hot. Now covers it says okay are you on this Jensen pushes down
here for both of these two teams and I do think it's interesting because we have this Revenge match right because we have a lower bracket and I am just so interested what are the adaptations that TSM has made of the analyst desk with the triple golden Guardians prediction, but I think that you can get them does have ways to win this series right if it if we saw the golden Guardians are going to go to the same route with her fully targeting beards in with their trying to get winning to be Tuesday to me the obvious adjustment had to be TSM fix your support champion pool try to put yourself in a position to be able to punish the blind work on it because that is what Golden Gardens was going to time and time again there triple Banning beards in here already yes you can call some of those black bands for the pop but really this is kind of all folks that beer can the far so that it's the same as it was last time around I'm going to be so interested to see if it is okay for Morgana this sort of style and if so what is TSM Panther in game number one because I do feel like bowel Crossing double this month's play at a higher level than doubled since replay last time around PSwant to chat well there's the Caitlin first pick there's the ass answer and now TSM how are you going to win your support matchup are you in the ass lyrics Nonpoint are you blind and support are you waiting till 3rd pick how do you make sure the two on two goes well because TSM with biofrost pens to win length either without biofrost and lose weight at the I knew he also tend to women almost every time so Grace picked up please send likely to be the answer will see what else is locked in so I do prefer to say to your support pick 2/3 here there is no support pig locked in unless you assume that it's going to be in Oceanport which I think is incredibly unlikely I do think this is going to be 10 top so there's not going to be necessarily parody in the pics I do think itsm could go for Morgana now and then been out some of the answers to that if they wanted to go for that sort of Route if they feel like that is our pick you up so can match than top and then try to ban out some of those 4th for have to he would go to a or even say if you know fifth pick counterpick going to be going top almost guaranteed against theNBC licorice play yesterday I do think it is a good answer and finally we're seeing more than just GP as an answer and thanks I tend to think that Cassio and Vlad both suit very very well alongside a d jungler they're strong massive into tanks the scale very well alongside them so I think it's an intelligent answer but of course Shen the concern is always what is he going to do outside of the lane not necessarily in that lane in a watch how this place out because how you got a flat Amir yeah you're thinking this isn't straight don't get me wrong but if you ever do good you know worn down you got to see CJ and Izabela Baer spend to kill you so you want to make sure broke a bacon free far but then in the mid-to-late game really be that that carries North I went back and watched Nikki's co-stream of some of these games as well that's the last time you seen her in that you want for the match up at the Caitlin Tool & Qs through the mini way of that also hit ask if you don't do that you should befind a little bit so it's closed at least according to him at the very least if it's an undisturbed bot Lane that is an advantage to double up the bathroom system matchup and I do tend to think that it's you know can be slightly favorite towards Ash in a base on the eve of hitting Vale versus the bills were Peacemaker generally think of that supports have a bigger effect right so if there is a big support mismatch all the sudden that's kind of out the window and lo and behold five bands for the beards in 12 or 15 of those Guardians bands did go towards beer tent in the last series so make it easy meaning of 20 now our bands against Derrickson over the course of these four games he's going to attend or anyway what guess what they did it pushin forward this I think it's obvious open Bic that clearly golden Guardians would have been worth I think Echo makes sense as an answer to Ward's it is considered you know what kind of a counter picks so to speak in the early Lane Paisa can be a little bit tough against the Sandra and that delivers range Advantage, but if you can play this match of aggressiveespecially post sex you can really come out on top and then you're playing alongside the Shen do you have the potential to go into 131 the other pencil to group up and really after their and Lux support this is something that has been missing from the ALCS Championship you know playoffs here or is it support pick I think it's incredibly strong and I think that looks does have a pretty heavy Advantage even against the car, Ash have very good push but what Caitlin is something that is really popular elsewhere in the world and locked it it's really really strong it in solo queue as well so despite the fact that it is believed that the last pic deer for bow Frost and he has the support counter so to speak I do think that they got the word that end of the support back up again just because the golden Guardian kind of flick did the math here anyway I will these are banned out you know what are you have is an answer it doesn't feel like they have the best one that being said it's it's still a lot closer I think as far as the bot Lane matchup than what we saw in all three games in the previous seriesis exciting I'm always a huge fan of teams that do a bunch of dress present come out with exciting pics it's Golden Garden to Demonte don't worry bring out the echo it's a good pick you old the old and you're going to be really happy on the other side may be the single strongest support in League of Legends right now is Lux yes this is still 10:16 these small Shield nurse are not in on this patch she's still very good in 1017 probably still take a Poulan Pro play as well but luck has an absurdly absurdly good picked out the bottom light to go ahead and answer with Karma you're so that you wouldn't like 8% lower than mine like we're good here this is is they Swagger Champion overall I really like the golden Guardians draft I think this is very intelligent of them I don't think he's them was like you know into their draft either I know that was like a lot of the criticism that TSM got the first time around was it felt like they were never really able to move the ship pools around this wasn't a solid to you some better ways have concerns forwhat time is having no because you have relatively low and Gage against it a team that wants a full Bush right and so went when you're in these types of situations you generally become incredibly depended upon winning or laning phase because then the way that you win the game is by being ahead so that you can go to the objective and 4th Airborne to come to respond and then you killed them are you take the dragon or the bear to whatever that's generally how this has to be played out a sheet gauge is not enough right you know tree candy right to get these light Amir flags and stuff we don't have to go buttons on the TSM side so I think that is going to be the concern for them against the team that wants to spread the map that wants to split push them to death do with this Echo Shannon and they also have you no more ways to start a fight with Echo going in with the stand United in these types of things I bought two maybe looking for some sort of wrap around or or invade maybe just going to camp in this brush and see if anyone came forward to actually go for a little bit of a wart ignition because sometimes people will just move in it and look for that way into workall right well they're going to try for it I am wore the fantasy dry stuff not going to happen though it does mean that if there was any kind of invaded by Golden Gardens no one's there to meet it or the word comes down from closer into the recall for the sweeper same exact play for who he soap those supports both junglers playing forward control over all sweepers early on only rewarded trinkets for either team at this point it looks like there won't be any big invasions and will be a very very standard jungle start on both sides so what I really want to track about this is bottom Lane TV to is Ken TSM get the bush because I tend to think that again Caitlin wachs you must maintain the push or it becomes nearly impossible to really get anything done in this and we'll see if you want to actually get select UNF third is I thought you're really big deal start things off but busy the reason it's so important physically in this matchup is really getting punished is because if you allow the Caitlin wachs to push you in what they will do as they will set up a trap line on one side of the turret and then theydrop the lucky on the other side of the turret and it makes it nearly impossible to actually step forward and farm as the Marksman player without getting poked so you must maintain the bushes at Shear alongside the karma you throw the vale to hit not only the minions but the enemy Champions to get photos taxi from lethal Tempo make sure the biofrost is using the cues to help push as well because if you can keep them walked in under their turrets so much easier to deal with this crap to deal with a lot of stuff because you don't have to take our kind of making the lanes smaller for you which makes it so much easier for your phone to say those killed us to see the intent on how to play the length of intercourse on both sides as well Lux in you know if you're playing her well is actually defensive support you're going Guardian your maximum Shield you are doing your very best to guarantee that nothing ever dies and I can work well against protocol in because you don't want to face shielding on there as well as other one exhaust in case there that Vladimir dive and it needs that yeah he's going to he's going to wait he's going to scale he's going to get a feeds going to be finewe really really trying to push in the early few ways I got to see a dependent if that a Health Advantage or its door and she'll in the post story used by FBI this is the kind of lame TSM and in Dublin want and it happened exactly you know this is all about that butcher and speak out of the top of them the Bucks ask him in the face in speaker put them in the ground that was such poor timing so unlucky therefore Demonte speaker with the perfect sense to be in the right spot right time does have a splash and flashy flash that jumps over bump transfer complete thanks for the cast of Honey thank you very much 300 more goal on the board with how long it took him I wonder if your couldn't have moved you know like originally looked like he was if I die yeah cuz it's looking like okay he's just do this but look at it over the wall itself you're just doing this situation for Flash show from Demonte I think he's going to have to do without the dad on you and you know it at this point like this is actually just a really nice play because they had a bit of a push pain at top side so flat Amir has first moved in what they keep its back in with those phone cards in a little pity home guards therefore it for dying curly on in lane and he's just going to get right in on top of them but because he took so I can walk it over yeah maybe it's kind of the we could have saved in there but that's a really hard call to make right you don't want your name to be doomed off of that back and walk over and then back into tonight milk maybe only have two spells and then yeah he finally came out of the area and it was too late so dumb right now to to 400 based on rounding in which can't slow down 7 CST for doubles down to the bottom line on the top side so far so good. But do you say I'm doing just fine. They're letting faces are going well the only 10:30 thing for CSM is it is of course the help us what the kills on to jamonte you know I talked about the only the only part of this set the generally feels really tough unless you just get slammed as Echo is the early Lane face that where you're going to get an auto attack down and white spotted so closer has nothing here undetected will see if they can actually get on top golf Austin or so if you actually get us done on him into a fighting he's just going to die translate finding me that to go get side that's rough for CSM because they weren't such a good spot look how low are over for Golden Gardens so if they actually didn't get that gag to build them out they would have had to base with the wave potentially Frozen on them which would have given the TFM bottom Lane incredible Advantage so in the to be to get them doing great but clothes are the one who really disrupt that it and turns it around let them get that good FaceTiming off and now this Lane will be much more comfortable than it was for the golden Guardians at the very least we can punish is Diwali in pink with to camp at the polar bear can't gain XP he won't grab either or is he looks around and missing things he's like yeah sorry about that you missed awards has gone he knows where the phrase was it's going to be a recall on the top side but hey double and kabocha can't believe he's going to be looking for you happy as far as the jungle one he want and then it just before it becomes known which is going to be more effective which has more of an impact there now they're moving down towards his Dragon to have control over Midland they had to push their and after that kill over and bottom Lane they have would have pushed you there so we'll see if they're going to the one to make the first move closer is spotted over by that dragon with find out if if the attempt to regain the bush year in the bottom line to V2 I want me to swing back and forth and if you can drop down we'll see if the Drake ever does get attacked right now is it effective control Wars will eventually be swept but right now if I was holding that one mid push-ups help him have Lane control for a while but those have been timed out the last bit with the Relic Shield in that means the squad comes down and go brush for who he is if we were built have a lot of stealing and shielding you can she still deal damage does a 10% how thank you more if you look really bad kind of killed him off with its getting a lunch deal then you can't break that anymore so it's nothing said about the day he was going to just get to stop mate back and forth a lot here oh my God is running low on how to get out barely skirting out of that set at 100% I would have been pretty scared about that actually Landing cuz that look like is his little pinky toe is still inside the Sun and we'll see if they can appear with it. That was going to be a death penalty out it's not going to hurt that badly but looks away from them it's going to be so it actually is pretty bad because that's going to stack on his side and look at the trouble with love and generally speaking when I see this in for
competitive lane, two different styles around that tool Golden Gardens looking for the early stacking of those dragons psf trying to go for the gold lead and then can test at number three but golden Guardians came up big when it matter most securing the two contested dragons hatching out DSM when they miss positioned up around that Top Lane and as a result they did take down that game number one so we'll find out if there going to be any sort of a changes in pick ban I don't really think there needs to be honestly on either side I feel like that was a very very close game and you don't even if you are on the TSM side I don't think you're going to look at that game and be like oh yeah everytime he was going to secure two dragons then we're going to lose like that you know it feels feels like it could be overcome for both point of views your teeth and picking redside both times here they are the higher speed of course communicating once they get site selection and then the loser of Any Given game gets I'd like to in the next 2 years and still wants to read cited still want counterpick this time they aretake the gun by Banning away the chef trying to get Hotspot they can't just ignore him. Smith also to see if they drop the Morgana band I'd like to point on the Analyst at talking about if you're going to go far, lastic you if you don't need to Ben Moore gone out or gone as good as you're likely to deal with that, and Ashton Deluxe actually was so I think that could make a lot of sense there also is the ability to Braxton with Echo if you're concerned about that but Golden Gardens going to take it in a different direction we do now I'm curious Realty at them walk into their middling or here instead of going for a top laner recetas last time around to try to avoid more potential band getting thrown towardsI was Boulevard last time this time it's going to be to lease a pick up their clothes or thought about it over and gave him one but it with the option up to revisit his jungle Champions has no no going over here so humble a new look out of round to last time this time it's going to be picked up Lilia was the band that was dropped off by TSM for the shin but that wasn't actually selected various things are still just going to allow beards into tank even more advanced and end this does feel pretty intentional for the side of the SMU do you grab the orange here for Broken Blade you could then then out to the top laners that you are worried about contesting that orange from author and then you have a Buick Century probably go to thank you have more advanced in and have to be picking here even what it will be a more difficult situation 40th Samsung okay we asked for. Play arrange for in the bottle by TSM good of them to do so and it's okay yeah heroes are on top of heroes are inI think we're going to once again traffic bot Lane it's pretty likely to be a Karma down there and if it's something else is fine we'll figure out the matchup but we have Hartig a tree out front because play a default team fight and just get damage output from Topeka duerksen and double it or are they really blinded, now though right because if you actually try to take the pic and then we'll have to have additional answer you know beyond Morgana because they can't just take them organized sell counterfeit us bills now so that is something that does have to change it to you think they're going to Blind the karma 4th then and hope it golden Guardians has no more after this far as the poor fool goes I do think there are digital answers and then cuz other great matchups you into the karma takes like nah me if you go down immediately I actually think you'll slam that late but I'm not sure that he will be willing to play at we haven't really been thinking come out I also think that potentially the fact that she attempted been out any top laners and blindthat is somewhat punishable Hunters a guy who's actually very flexible up in the top line he has shown the kale before that is very popular GP is also an option if they want to look to play towards that bottom Lane utilized EF ultimate as well as GPL truly Focus ZTS and bought late again so there are some vulnerabilities to this DSM draft and they're actually wow so if you stay the convert 4 lakh I feel like Golden Gardens is for sure going to take it themselves but I guess we'll find out if you have to wait and see you right now Pantheon is the hoverboards will be excited to come through but I don't think play a tank and feel a lot better as like a Leona or something down the traffic North the whole thing but waiting for the top laner to answer broken play Surah Noor ayat in a week past that one kind of gone mordekaiser going to be there at a scrap of the top side of the old Deacon make or not do a whole lot of anything and by the way also absolutely loves death row support just like you have a hobby or a car or somethingability power and then just you're always get so you know but it isn't as well so bored in particular for Hootie relief techniques for the kills are you already have Lantern for the defense of utility is less about the poke in the actual straight-up Landing in the first year but you can actually have all the ins against you no farther than and Caitlin navigate to themselves into a pretty good ankle here to pick fresh fuel in their previous series the only times as they have fresh it was into a pumpkin to know anymore, which really is not kind of how you want to play it so I think we're pretty happy with this now they've added some additional engage they were perhaps concerned with with the few ways they had to actually start bites last time Donald do they have the appbest time to have thrush Oaks at Warren ultimate that is going to be pretty powerful one of the concerns I have for them is if they want to play that same style we're giving up the first two dragons and looking to steal two words with the word which I feel like they might be doing with his salary of composition you have to remember the other team has mordekaiser and can eliminate the possibility of the 50/50 sometimes we have seen how to be so on point with this where you show up that Third Bank me like all right we're ready to fight and then gets bored if eyes are all stood and they take the dragon for free and then we'll see how they want to do it cuz that it does feel like with Oriana or you want to sit back and scale a bit and in a Golden Gardens may be more ready to scrap for those are the dragons going to be a fun game to watch absolutely I'm still going to look at it look at bottom in a whole lot there can be so they can set up topside is not send with Vlad Vlad from Full House and doesn't have taken so he can't get a gank on his side either it's going to be spicy in every singlewhen he was going to be a lot of fun to watch the efforts Oriana the global run around the map Bjorn in gauges and we'll see what the bot Lane looks like here as well as getting a game to as Golden Gardens rf10 in this best of 5 and if I look at bot Lane a little bit I do want to point out that DSM does not need a hard counter pick every single time to win this across the 12 regular-season games that double up in biofrost played doubles had the best overall golden XP difference at 10 of all starting 80 carries me to get over all had very very very strongly with biofrost across the first well and so I want to see if they can hold that one. Because in playoffs if you are who we have an absolutely taking names down there they've been crushing it but last game to the credit of TSM I do think that they were wanting to take me to straight up close or had some great gang sand and they capitalized well on that you know it wasn't like they were getting crushed by any means before that it was barely even but I clearly tsm's bottom Lane Performing better than what I'm around for that is due to the pics for thatplay will have to see if they can keep that level up going into this one is Cleanse This Time Around 4 or from FBI so he is paying that tax because it's not only to ask but also the freshest I'm so I do think it makes sense there is also less rate up kind of a big beefy frontliners ahead of it so you don't have to Shannon this involve are standing up there to tank arrows for you come see five times more likely that you would need to climb in the situation of the ward at the bushes been golden Guardian to know what the other one down that brush time out is that was the earliest place of the recall switch the sweeper push goes in as far does a better early fighter than fresh the more reliable and even play it was learned Dauphin right now doublelift is on perfect CS or it's only 10 or 12 for FBI so we'll see how much more the app can get here as Hotshot reveals that closer did three cans of blue bus me know which weekend of Sargon Hot Cheetosbills of recant Barker's know exactly what the least we've been doing so far is actually going to have full information there that always feels really really nice as the opposing jump wouldn't know where he is where he could be they have that pushed on the bottom side the are kind of assuming the Golden Gardens is going to challenge for that bottom side Scuttle and then it's going to be up to speaker to say okay do I want to try to answer this do I want to at least get a Ford down here to protect us have no more sense we had a good first time by FBI or so it is very well played and what will see if they can follow up on this so they're trying to push it out right now because maybe they checking his lease in though and we'll see if we can get fined if the slogan for today to think who he thought there was more of a fight to be had but there was not one there wasn't but if he could have found that angle off of it and maybe follow up there either way he's not able to flyThe Binding so in the long run get them can't reset the wave but they got to Summoners big summer soon as I got the clients in the flash so that it can be feeling really really nice could trade up here on that top side for Broken Blade and we'll see if he s m can utilize this little Skirmish Advantage if they have gotten to try to get something more lies on this side of the map very small gold Goldie to Golden Gardens of that is fraudulent with Twisted Fate packages getting free gold that's despite the fact that he's playing the lane going to be really easily cleaned up going to see her first three calls were too terribly long as we can see more items being formed by Broken watch kids at the mask online. We don't have to worry about that fight too much and feed to give you the grand his side of the Jungle taken down the chicken gift and he saw that we're getting place that's always feels bad man forward to Monday cuzwhere did you place it does get cleared out and and for me personally anytime I'm in that type of situation of always feeling really nervous it's like he knows that I know he's there so is he going to expecting it you know if she feels like a little bit of that my game but clothes were tapping up so you felt comfortable to stay around and farm it up wasn't worried about the Rays game coming in and of course not exactly in there so it's going to be safe and that looks like your son will try to shut out one more wave and then reset well Demonte just is going to wait in Days Inn in Flowood CP here knocked off of Route 33 Jenning decently well overall gold is tied across these he said he carries the same at a farm this is the way if you want to recall hospice you could be to be a pro 245 PS that's more than enough to make it work Tim so pretty standard stuff in a bit.Island gold overall pretty close across every roll under a hundred across in any image will match up top in a weird spot it's over extending a forcing her to walk out to do this he was going to want it back before to kill everyone either death but with M D6 on that way that's why they looks like Hank I know the gang Clifton awkward like well it's pretty low chance of work that's really your last chance to actually can't work I just waited so long that's at the Monterey Pop it very early and I think Haddy not done that I think they kill thrush because they could have had the new The Binding into the gold card instead they just had to buy a new year expired use a blue flash out they have beer and not able to get the ball over in time in and get that Shockwave down was little bit late I think he was trying to go for the deliberate timing of a pulling leasing out of the portal perhaps but either way not going tobe able to get to kill there so it is just a couple Summers off of biofrost and now we can see a small gold in the face of speaker but as fun house away was manicure to go to Garden favor tablet has forced to be on the trip with your bf for 280 Carrie at the Midlands going back to Lane be stuck button problem and the early Cloud Drake will go over a few real great picked up a portal on his friends are the first time for a Demonte is impactful a word that previously was getting caught there actually forced him to be on a reset and he couldn't just stay out on the map when he was that low so that means that double as fast as he could go over the way but double pass to allow FBI and who need to push of it and that is exactly why he's under the part when they can start that Dragon so you know even though they didn't get the kill on biofrost the chain of events after it actually LED them to getting the first dragon which is really reallyplay for Golden Guardians going to be able to start off on the right foot here once again in game 2 without any issues York since the guys low Nicki Street on our way in fact he's doing. The Monte not enough right now to guarantee a crush on your Midland weather from the Blue Beats. Jungle that side of the Jungle really entirely is safe right here he goes to move around in his Bread close to go see second time. This is so far it's the kind of two games where speakers when playing with his grades and he's actually been getting CS advantages but it is been closer investing is time and actually helping out the rain did a lot of damage to fight does get knocked out the rest away from The Dock of the DiMaggioguy was too healthy but it will force recalls black overall I don't think he hasn't come out of there because they got both the ultimate and the TP actually off
this is going to be a rough game I think most teams from that point where did just continue to try to spoil should maybe try to get something done and probably about the game and said they recognized that wasn't working that group they depending on who he actually find your Breitbart ultimate and multiple times in a row he found the critical members on TSM got them those pics got them those kills and they are one game away from Worlds when they have never won a playoff series in the organization's history prior to this year and it has a split they want and go straight to work about 6 o and then you know a a battle has been faltering in the late have to split it certainly battle they could win because they they were the longest-running Wrote themethey were there for the very first one in 2011 and then 2018-2019 and now about to 20/20 missing it as well and of course rid of the draft so we'll skip this talk for now is set for 6:40 SF play in game 3 against golden Guardian last time around my tree up that one was like yeah give him one more for good times but I will see if they do want to put it in a top indoor jungle it is a three-way flax and fear anything goes to Port but generally only is it considered if it is going to beat your ass in the bottom Lane the Kailyn has been doubt Fitbit Alta TSM you're getting a lil bit more serious have made some adjustments they've been out the Caitlin so that's not going to be over for FBI they take the ass because they areblue sizes that are made out of patience to FBI will be put on more of a supportive stylish Champion we're saying almost exclusively farming Santa so you don't think it's going to be in a fasting Center or anything like that which doesn't mean that you're Double Toasted Beyonce me the hive has higher amounts of GPS they have easier that is a tremendous amount coming out from from the midline as well and we'll see how golden Guardians do look when I think there's going to be more honest on other members other than FBI to really be that seems by Carrie because all the Caitlin he's been getting work done in these last two games and answer again for the Kaiser only half sure that set it up in the Top Lane and I believe it's actually more commonly a jongleur anyway but once that when locked in as soon as possible and they'll wait to see we'll see if he somehow the counter picks so mordekaiser in mind as you can see the mordekaiser in two oranges but we're going to be at work here I mean if if you are willing to actually commit to more of a sideline player a Top Lane dial and I'm not surethen we'll be but Jack's is a great a great matchup right you can block of all of Eric's done with that is a q cancel auto attack you know you win that one the one you can help scale the more Kaiser in the ones you want that can be very very strong it does require some attention that could be protected Jack's especially in the early game when Jackson star leave honorable but you can get at a tremendous athlete Advantage I also think that it can help to denying and match up well against things like the ethical Guardians want to go that way as well because you can also block the gold card with Yuri it's fairly powerful against Santa who is in a Reliance on on you but very strong Auto attack so they can work out go out there and not sure if you would be willing to go to it because it's not just broken play they would have to make you just spent the entire do you have to play differently around one of those kind of Side Lane counter picksall right well mordekaiser being covered by V gang plankenhorn bands DSM throwing some Midland band that we've been seeing out of golden Guardians his Lucien would like a pretty solid liquid and be go to pick that we had before you saw this still want to wait after I met with the echo be like like it's Sandra we like it again this year to really interesting cuz I actually would have felt like the ziggs with it more alongside the Senate because Santa is fairly low DDS right to tell me what a really high sorcery DPS from another Lane the jack that talk about it I think it's a pic I didn't think I'd get that would have the confidence to go to it but they are going to so I'm actually so excited we get to see how TSM can play around a side lane wind condition especially with an ATM and a tank jungler you can rush things like it within which are ridiculously strong in21 and itemized heavily towards that because anyone is going to answer you in the cycling is going to be magic damage if you will carve a lots big the only physical damage they really care about it all is going to be from Santa That's easily answerable by your Counter-Strike do I do think that your item is a she becomes incredibly simple this game you do for Broken Blade that can be really really tough to deal with if they can get it going if you can get the things like with end Destin smirk threads of course you're going to want you know maybe the boy 2 room King and Triforce in there at some point but the AP atomization the antiope itemization is quite strong for the Jack self this is a really smart pick and I like a TSM have the confidence to go to it and what would be an elimination game here for them yeah there is a witty repartee SM it is this when I like this, a lot I think is a good person to ask player I love the Broken Blade back to the second kind of thought he wants to play I want to see speak to spend some time up there Pearson's azir we know is absolutely phenomenal just stopped the draftfeels like TSM taking a game moving Us 2 game for obvious you have to play the game out but I like this one so much I think the The Goldbergs what conditions are so incredibly narrow here but yeah they are but I mean if we Freeze Frame last game you know at the point where DSM gets Soul what are the odds are giving right like if you know you're giving TSM incredible odds so you still have to be able to play with the game and I will say and I think the draft is Fantastic Four TSM but they have not really shown me like The Horde split push style off from their top laner this split they had that one fantastic irelia game but I do think irelia functions more easily in teamfights compared to Jax Pavan X Jackson Whittemore time in those Island and this requires not just an adjustment for Broken Blade because I'm sure he can play the champion it requires an adjustment from your entire team on how you play around the game on protecting the jackpot on escorting In Waves if it ever gets Frozen on them guarding him and all these situations which means not only does your delightfully different well guess whatthe other lane so they have to play more safe so it's a total team shift and that's often why I don't think we see Jack's if you are and champions like that as often as the matchups themselves would dictate which issue all right well we are out of the restaurant could be the last time of the year for TSM they must win this and the next and the next game and then i b o v Cloud 9 if they want their season to stay alive otherwise golden Guardians will complete their sick so sweet during the playoff run and have a date for one final bfi4 world and then maybe even farther along in the playoffs regardless of a good showing for gold Guardian so far FBI and who he have been absolutely phenomenal and it wasn't because of the keeping up pretty well do you assemble see if I can get this one of the finish line here in game three again I'd like the draft broken bow to the late war did as we know it going to be a top side start now for the polar bear and a leash list speaker on rent BF really fast Red Bull out there with the mordekaiser least and folder also just asked you a quite a quick clear on that Red Bluff so he'll be very nice outside if we can get a picture of that to pull the minion so that will push towards if this is to make sure that you have all their can't go for any sort of cheesy level 2-k you Groove Dominion so that they would come to you and then you can you play defensively and still collect that farm because there's always that chance that evolve are just goes red top and then tries to tease you out a meeting on Hunter aside you can see even though yes you know the other men just took some damage will the early is always go down in trade St Frontier on the side table to First me that preys even easier where the jack is because you require the three hits from mordekaiser to park passes that is there so much of his strength is so generally speaking you do that with a Q and E & N Auto you can Counter Strike that auto and push back for a long time him actually pranking that passive right so it's more actually go through you that that work either passive and it makes it very difficult to fight The Upfront damaged coming through from Jax to Jack's players can you continually when you have to go down and then Retreat before it becomes a really extended bite clean Evernote a car and you can you can take zero physical damage to match I bet you play it around Counter-Strike the entire time or something his way but yeah so far so good you see the first potion or he shoved through the forest crafting stock knock out a broken place I can swing the match up and there's no work so we have it Forward OK the cloud will not hit those so this is done Town Huntington Beach right now and we know we know it jump to there's not much else to do so now here comes the jump back to the topside nothing to be defensive flashpro concert didn't want to be flash he's done by speaking to lose the lane but this happens already over that is really well done your front Broken Blade actually think flashing up in that case is better than blacks your jugular because of all of their SKU expired so that is actually what he got because that's the Gap close but that is actually your son as well so many flashes awaits where the Alcove that expires and then vulvar can no longer go for it because you're not going to come down before the set arrive so really intelligent stuff here from Broken Blade speaker coming back in does results in that crate and Hunter has actually base right to Hunter's first by is just a refillable and the cloth armor broken plate still has two biscuits & Noble chart are from from his class so much better by and now they're looking glass broken plate has teleporting get away without Flash there's a chance for the things do unlikely your gums to pull back not going to Land Rover by the minions and time is spent pops by the other day and I can't just put it on speaker but it it's froze the lane against it so it's actually going to eat equalizer bar and now he has to be back in just all she had to do is just walk in recess a wave and then probably faces and walk back to Lane has PP Advantage it's dead because the wave is frozen off of that cake he took multiple power shots he has to go back to base before he hadn't even better by Jessica visit teleport to unfreeze Elaine so you know they took what was a really big winning made it worse good Bart very close to that's going in TSM favorite because it is that he'll for the flash well played overall by the Golden Gardens go to fight their way out of what was a 3D to so pretty nice stuff for that I will see how much is Farm Duluth can grab but it is going to be a golden Guardian spawn leave your somewhat expected in before relief days before, I definitely have the advantage is ignite, karma's a very have leaked item rising and setting up router for that Laney baby dolls that is really for the way here from whence belfies going dark souls whose you have a tremendous amount of Mana regen in Black Manta and really just try to slam this to be to this is the first time it felt like you had a big TV to type advantage in this series so far in the lady face and they're going to try that. which network right well post game overall in at least for now hunting to lick his wounds and catch some Farm he's going to remain under ten Zs difference will though it's probably on a crow over the course of time the first week of work late. Massive lunch with a different place pretty good cloth armor but we'll see if this can move any further for now because I'm through the bottom line FBI getting a pretty nice and this is the first time he's gone play the ruined King across the three asking so far things okay you do have plans we're not going to try to force the cleanse tag to do much we're going to go for optimal he'll fight Bowser a lot it's it's understandable but slow hell thanks for getting the house back and it did hurt your GPS having The Vamps after four lane also can be pretty nice when you're playing at the karma who you know really is going to depend upon that photo that coke to to get control of the lanes you know as much as you're saying LOL Target okay, but if you're getting that mordekaiser that ball the bear in The Champions that are building up quite a lot of help when they are high on El Colibri King obviously going to have a lot of the dollar bill here and I'm excited to see where Broken Blade goes and is built I am expecting boy the ranking first and if that's pretty darn standard these days but where he goes after the triforces the most standard or something I would really be interesting to me now a fight in a Polar Bear Creek flooded you not one is forced to 6 but doesn't open for the fight may be a possibility there but if we needed it so not going to get a whole lot done regardless of the way she's being pushed in TSM 200 Gold by putting it back in might be getting their own we'll see if they want to stick around for this one seems like people have no Ward control speaker is on crutches and ready for this word might be a little difficult 3 level 6 for biofrost not the same for who he and thankfully Karma has an Ulta in the first few levels and now if I can a midline Devonte give me a bit Locust hold it back by Pearson Olson for the health but overall deer should not going to take the winds that trade overall
reverse sweep they got to back and fly questions like what's plan to close it out in game 5 but we've had so far in the ALCS playoff even though the exact median and average score line is 321 we may have that one here at work in the day but right now we are on Golden Guardians picking red team decided they lost game 3 on it but it's not going to know we have a draft plan in place it's more assassin bands irelia is left upset is gone instead and pay for them is off the board in Siesta coax right you know what your ass and then and try to see if the dates would have been response or feel just be sent at once more at the lane went rate for FBI in Hootie but such a different team when you compare the agency that FBI and who he had in the previous games do what they had in the last game when you compare the Senate and the karma to what these guys were doing on Caitlin and Bard and even the Lux it isright you know it's like okay they had a place in Glades yeah but the other games they were just mod stirring in teamfights finding pix finding engages so we have to see if gold Guardians get can make it work I would be interested to see if they'll save their last pick 4 hot in this time around but it is not done well in the LCS at all but this is a Duel of Champions that is apparently just ravaging strips across all teeth and this is essentially people are are are described me as an even stronger release reactant style where they feel like you should be able to have full control over any sort of topside TV to we should be able to go aggressive set up the Middle East for years very easily with that protected and if you land that combo to pretty much be dead for any top later so that that is what it supposed to be in execution your jungle is outpacing them you have this monstrous to be too but what has actually beenshow me a scene it is definitely just kind of farm Steven and it doesn't do as much as the other junk like teen sites really have got to be able to Snowball the game and make things happen early because he's just too hard to Pilot in in the later stages and this is the second time in as many days that sponsor has opted into both sides of the same match at work so for example I get steam liquid it alright okay my counterpick is Renekton let's go as what I'm playing and failed to have late game victories against impact they are just like. Actually boxing in the top of match even he was up and gold now he's he's he's like okay my answer is Mordecai's it's like if you want then you'll take anyone who cares if that's the case why don't you play real time to pick up the other side we have in this series The Man played mordekaiser as a counter to Orange and then blind or deaf or blind for the Kaiserwework Kaiser a little confused by the thought process here in the topside he clearly likes play board a lot and that's fine but I'm just very just the idea of how he's kind of a strange to me so what one caveat that will give is that not always are you picking for late right if you just feel that I need to fulfill its role and that is perhaps not getting a lot of jungle attention being scrapped you know it is as far as playing on the topside or perhaps you're forcing qss is they feel that is important to be able to let you know more about the jungler that is important and maybe even though the ones you wanted to hit suorin that he lured us into things that are too strong in the Deep by right I think that's probably my guess at how they're looking at it I do tend to agree that it is very important that you know baby there they're overlooking that somewhat but we will find out we do get a pretty spicy big down here on the bottom side is alionagoing up against that Ash Ash very low mobility and work on it that is so interesting to me like this is supposed to engage from the wreck on with always pick as the rakan counter so to speak with someone that did have a right to answer into it because you could walk down the rakan Fairly simply work on is generally not Tanki enough that if it were gone goes in and you just Q Alta View just kind of died before being able to utilize Mobility to get in and out that being said again this could just be straight up for the 585 less about the interactions between the two and work on paired alongside that Oriana is going to give accessed warp jerks into all the backlight right in the teeth get on top of the graves is Donna and delete those champions from it and that could be very very powerful okay ya Leo coming through so that's really work for the parent with the Leona also you know I think give some additional power to that pick who he on it on a Chevy that has while the agency Demonte on something that cat robe I think that Graves Drake's cover up for the weaknessesquite well but it does still mean that close early and was going to be having to have a good game gear for this team to have enough consisted damage I think if not I'm going to be tracking this jungle match so heavily because it does feel like because got to get things done in the early stages and closer if he gets put too far behind that will be very detrimental for him but like really going to be probably pretty useless late well it's going to be a fun one here as we are done with the draft we got Global Champions a gun from the Montage deer TF his most played second in line is that galio season to go around to the side will see which ones he can impact their Leona Santa definitely spicy I've always a fan of Champs withhold that you just kind of layer over the top of the engaged Senate does this as well does this Graves does this do when someone comes in your almost always arranged to help and put a one shot that chap we seen it work before and Ashley can be a decent Target in Oreana cavities at Target neither have innate dashes in the kit they got to walk or they got a Flash and if there's done they can't flash so I want to see how goodone shot potential is how it's going to go I agree to the Jungle matchup seems really interesting you've got very explosive high damage Champion Middle Lee we see different builds we've seen the essenes rush that she could be supportive enough that we've seen what was the oldest you can be more of a damaged in the front line enough that she's not going to die just her counseling it ever since yours what build that's going to be but you got a decent coverage of damage profile lot of progress on both sides and do or die it's going to be really really exciting DSM-IV stepping up in that previous game having the most dominant game of the series but that was who he off of a gaethje is back on it this time around it is such a clear Target of picking on doublelift it feels like yes he's going to play the Glens but you know if you could just immediately going with the dentist Layton Key Walt you know it's a very easy for the sun has happened where you you cleanse with you from the onus rabies to the elephant that galios going to be all thing on your head that could be pretty frightening it does feel like a game with a lot of qss value with double AP solo lanersMagic Cube from the Leona plus a tremendous amount of CC so we'll have to find out north Douglas is going to able to survive against that kind of dive in Pierce and also in an easy major vulnerable here to wait for me to watch for as we get into the rift did we see what the plans are going to be worth coming down speaker surround going to keep is what he drink it if you want to switch to a sleeper but hasn't put his drink it down if he's doing so okay you have to be very late in that brush to watch maybe later invade potential or looking to be on his own blubaugh it might mean he's going to have some interesting passing down the line and golden Guardians must bring up for a late invade and sure enough speaker or his analytical his homework said do not my words not hear my word is elsewhere it's on the Bluetooth selfie invade me having to know so they won't be spotted by the ward but you're usually on the invite but they will be spotted obviously as they go over toward that blue buff and this will allow speaker to hopefully for his sake I'll be able to get up and then starts vertical jump length no Take that blew away from his opponentsbut that being said if tsm's bottom line is pushed in there's also a defensive war from Golden Guardians over by their blue. So they will know that that is happening and there is a potential FBI and who he going up and try to collapse a tent closer in Vision when they leave to go as a result of this one guess as you mentioned bottling push is coming to the golden Guardians sides that it has been killed on both sides and a lot for the coverage running around goes to the warden your tribe rugs okay if you are ever leaving about of jungle you'll have to go through the river the bottom corner the three in which by the way is where to get as well as of this point to say okay delete has not crossed she has not gone anywhere she's may be going to your top jungle but she's definitely not going to your bottom jungle yeah it feels like at this point because they say just going to take it was may be anticipating the closer we go Blue to blue or not going to be nicely done speak about Broken Blade down closer smited to guarantee the chickens we're going to be bypassed every single board that is very tight timing so I really wonder if it's because I had it with that well timed out that he was thinking he was going to go Blue to red and need to start time for that or you know if he was thinking that he would go Bluetooth blue anticipating a speaker would go there and tried to send it and you just thought would be undefended read now cuz that was very close in like an extra hour to know from the mordekaiser leasing at Blue buff might have gotten Graves that the clear speeds actually you have that red done in types of yours that complicated looking for that one as a 5-minute to make him have a rough time is the blank yeah it's an easy recipe to the way to push it away from so you're going to be really scared and we'll have to see how does medium wave actually kind of shakes out in midlane to really determine who that was better for the other things that that actually does have to go and gold wedding favor is that already based God is backed by off already gotten back to base and this is going to push toward the mate so it will be bad for Bjergsen on the TV as far as the minions and you won't have to go back to pay self to mate potentially could keep the shoved in and 4th Street New York City pick up or recall and closer course why do the bottom step is laying those about to begin from the southern side it's Beka has not yet been in the bottom side but that's generally speaking worth it a flash was asked to be a very easy Target and this is every time they seem to get eyes on on biofrost moment they looked upon ashrae to the previous game it was by Zonnique doublelift off of off of minions honor is our this game file Frost moves up be spotted by that tribe Russian dwarf and Abby Lee doublelist has his flash horse with that trait from who need this is something you've been very willing to do throughout the season has really look for these aggressive trade on to the enemy Marksman and buy a process with him in general just got a charger really making sure that when they are looking for these boots when are looking for is reims from biofrost that they are not spotted on Wards or that they have some sort of other coverage for doublelift because he's getting punished every time is public storage in his favor doesn't say my name is back to himself or half of what he took at the trade plus promenad stacking yet to see any recalls out of the mid lane is going to take me to get some of that back up and overall going to catch the far you got to one see a difference in mid and diersen following take his recall might have lost chapter money or to your ass out here and it would have been worked there to stop the recall because your son had no TP and because he had to wait for a candidate to not lose a full wave on the recall I think it's actually worth taking the hit there but of course you're not sure exactly where he is so we'll be a little bit the way not much of a pain is there from here to me handles that about as well as you can if you picked up the rest of his farm and it will have equalised quite a bit but still that proactive down to the bottom side from him because he had to push ended up getting a 11 CST in the bottom line is that with locks back to the land of catching some of it pretty comfortable item sat here for FBI is he gets once again petcock plus call is a decent one there and double it's not quite as it looks like I'll do is going to help enforce dodging Leona being class listen to just go for the more defensible option but I think I would have the money for be if you wanted it regardless who cares what he has in this one is who he waits on the Middle Lane speaker cannot stop and play towards whom it is not going to materialize so if you land that knock up now from Demonte into a tunnel in Dudley on a walk down your food is just dad's we got to rely on for these got to rely on good position here I do want to see you just became a broken play try to repeat on author of the article off on a two-post 6 on mordekaiser kind of weird that they're supposed to start and Low by the way I really going to matter that much but it does feel like a like a minor thing that had broken play been wanting to freeze you taking off early fiber regardless if he has said getting some extra stops here fotus armor am I from Mount Drake cloud is going to be next if we're going to happen in Seoul this game which is the one that has the highest so that'll be pretty exciting to see when golden Guardians want to list of the college they may be the team kind of sitting on the back foot as TSM was in some of those first games are in the first game where you get free dragons I wouldn't be surprised to see if gold Guardian are the ones kind of looking more for that point wait till the second or third Dragon try to complete some of your major items and then use your ultimate combinations here between to the Galliano mordekaiser all these super powerful level 6 is try to make things happen that is a lot of time away from getting experience that doesn't mean he's going to be a lot less valuable at this point and also because he was going to roaming know that also means double does is missing from this Farm is the result where you know he has 3/4 so you got to play a bit more defense today. Looks like any of the phosphorus have
there by headed out passes let's get into the actual games where you have to deliver every game now does count towards International games as well look into be Representatives every team striving to be number one at the beginning I do want to delve into a little bit of black West do because as much as you want to give a pass to the team liquid games you have to observe what actually went on in these games it's not just who won who lost who is your opponent and getting free passes that way there were definitely a lot of problems with the bottom Lane I think Johnson previously when he showed a lot of progress on dignitas benefited from aphromoo being there his leadership is mentorship in the bottom land and when you put in another new player Diamond no coming up from Cloud 9 Academy in the bottom side they did have some directional issues finding V bandeau for the jungle focus on this side you would put Thalia if you were going to go for the Tilley at the jungle combo pack for Europe banned from previous to lock in booty or might jump up though and take his place as that's been kind of a sweeping skip across all Regent 11.23 km in a couple of days ago the nurse the pantheon and boujee or are not in this past are still too friendly talk to your jugular that are likely to get taken away is ready for the pantheon Band Time taken away for flyquest do indeed get rid of food You're So triple Jungle Band against speaker by the way I would argue at Worlds maybe are you a pretty great and just went through jungle bathroom still gets an incredibly strong jumbler in Tulia open do Lilia Jose the audio that's what it's like West Winds in Walking tournament on that plus you have the opportunity for you know things like Graves I very much doubt Fiddlesticks which Shuffle up early on the cookout on W got nerfed which made it significantly more difficult with a real seraphine bottom land lock in do likewise already showing that they are probably going to have seraphine carry down on the bottom side like we're talking about for Johnson and Diamond as being a pain point for this flyquest lineup that that lane is is quite safe for yourself you don't have to have to overextend fretless very good at going for set up to you when you can call your jungler so basically this Lane is it kind of baby proof for the bottom line in my opinion you just wait until they come and then you got a crazy initiation Trail setting up for seraphine login for Windows to Champs are Level 6 that is crowd control calor is globally competitive play Serafin fought at the carry is as common as Serafina at the mid laner she is truly a flex pick she is you can play free rolls most awfully hard to Fort 4th of not the case but that is an option is open for these teams I don't want anyone to get likes it going to be like it is only going to be down at bottling because that is definitely not true regardless we got a syndra coming through for po we at you know you're taking over beers call Mark here in your opening regular-season game for the bot Lane should be pretty good handle property tax with a well with the ultimate of course and autopista en Des Champions ofac to be a good look are playing a jury go forward relied Jose get a composition for the acronym dive heck road going to come down and look for those skills he brings the damage I actually like this direction of a strategy for flyquest Jose coming in definitely one of the strongest players beer for the squad and setting him up with confidence with a heck room while jungle is in the state that it's in right now where you can be a true carry definitely like this a lot to use I'm going to have to start thinking about how to engage actually been out one of their own possible choices there with a Leo probably because you know what star and syndra it's too much to see there's there's really nowhere to fit in but there are other things that you could look you for Connor engage a lot of them are actually AP heavy though so this does make it a little bit more difficult 40th Ave can't do anything like Swain broadcast also AP those are some of the super common once yeah cuz as soon as sacrifice merch Reds and real by the nurse provide to 18% and stops play quirks I just seen the attack damage obligate Champions are the ones that live in Spanaway Serafina uw's like every single one of their feasibilities how old is that you can still be fine after the CDC consider I feel like Gangplank for honey because they need more attack damage threat it has good counter gauge options with lots of Zone control in AOE as well and it's one who needs best champion and he's been one of the players that has been struggling 40s and if lock-in tournament with any indicator looks like licorice going to beat him to the toppling punch stow and go for the Camille if you're going to Pick n Plankinton Camille heck Grump you better if you watch it out and they chose to wait on Midland Tech course they know they were against Indra she typically good at the Oriana but Oregon if it's the cops so that's kind of the race and therefore Palafox but it said you know who he might take the Camilo I want to make sure you lock Us in for ourselves more board knows you'll never take her Oriana a way we can get that last pic if it's likely the game did you call that one out definitely going to be a strong one here to hold on against these. I'm here I'm glad that you mention your possible counter games on bottom side Sword Art the 5 million dollar sign up for TSA is on Alistar this is literally my favorite Champion I've ever seen Sword Art play when he's on flash for Sony. International Event on the Alistar planking around through anime jungle controlling vision for the team having set up a shock collar for the squad you want him on a playmaking champion that's definitely a very viable strategy for TSM to go to games like ultimate Tulia ultimate down there to wallum off make sure you can try and get some kills and actually punished why do flyquest weakest areas and I want to point out real quick I love this so much as sort out was walking last champion keepkey clickteam o senta Misfortune Misfortune TSM TSM Block in the MF it warms my heart so much just like seeing Thea sent me, is indeed the midline or hear it means Camille and heck room or the physical damage for flyquest plenty of math games coming out of Oriana and sarafine as well we usually see Moonstone seraphine though I'm still partial to Leann trees. The Field Museum Pro play together and if lost in play for in a fact that he is not be primary Chapin engaged upon that over-the-top is going to look really good I mean they they do have really really big areas if they can control if you can make it work with the stun from cindra and the sons from I'll start with your knocked up so it's going to be an exciting one here clear top side carry for flyquest with the jungle hecarim and topside Camille So taut triangle of the map has to be very important to them maybe we even see some level ones trying to set up for deeper vision NSI you don't have for the jungle so that speaker doesn't put a wrench in those plants at its peak has been one of the most active jungle is that we have had in the LCS very very proactive has really been outstanding super super strong jungler Gladius and finally figured out that I want to play with I think this guy could be on the roster for 4 years and years and years and truly be a Cornerstone player in the NFL a sad before chance like I had to give her the best performing player of TSM for the last four months right now counting World's End of the early 2021 season I think he's really been phenomenal looking forward to what he could do on this first pick to Leah next weekend but he'll find something else to be on because he is very very good and I want to see how much the wrestlers roster comes together it's TSM with with 40 players it's Pica in a whole new roster around him and you know so far they had a quarter Final Exit they lost a cloud 9 the first round of the lock in playoffs and and that was the end of the season and we got to wait and see what they can you know waiting for for the beginning of 2021 for the regular season and in the homes are rebuilt their roster as well that we're all going for game 1 of LCS 2021 DSM are also an organization that always have kind of one eye looking off into the Distance chords International success part of the reason that they have done this multiple times with Aaron invest a lot to pick up a shock collar for the team Sword Art definitely the most accomplished of any of those attempts that they have they tried to go with you know I'm coming straight off of a World Finals but with every game now that the LCS is actually started poster walk-in counting towards those International Events sports qualification to representing North America these are the ones where they're really going to lay it all out on the line let's see what both teams have learned I from the early stages looks like a scoby bottom side start for both of them heading up towards the possible Gangplank matchup okay yep Jean Blues on the bottom side means I'm going to end up topside at 3 minutes and then I'll be over looking at right now unless you have Shenanigans you'd be like at 3 Camp in the bottling clear which is unlikely but I guess possible jungle start their for Jose do y'all do going to get the heavy leishman's do Elaine Johnson going to hold onto his devil cast once that four-lane pressure so the very mediocre sarafian Auto attacks of the only addition he's going to provide several do for lost in Sword Art put it in their own autos and hitting the sosta lane a sequel Pine sacrum the strongest level one tank doesn't get to provide a whole lot so going to play mostly on the back foot cure TSM by lost let down his want to get him anything yet now I want to talk a little bit out who needs Gangplank specifically because there's a reason I was banned so much against him when he was in his prime and there's a big difference between you know some of the other LCS King points that we've seen not play aggressively early on with his champion I love gangplanks early level one power booty always tries to make use of his trial by fire that passive at level one does so much for you so he sets up barrels in the brush to try and use to refresh his passive constantly goes to stack of his grasp rocks then we'll shoot off at just as you see here thank U observers he gets the Q Plus then he gets another explosion they're so nice job I him start our clothes for a smaller gauge trade on bottom side though some decent damage but there's no something on a diamond so does it mean at on Lost takes a look at a poke but there's going to keep healing on backup Johnson by the way is doing Arie and not Guardian so if he started he be much safer against getting dope because you can put a shield on and then battle allowed guarding the trigger next to me takes damage and and that would help him quite a bit with him a little list quick way for your power of evil 24 out of 25 bottles he has very very good and needs to watch peaky take down the Scuttle and Takis recall and so it should be here for Jose down to bottom say hi to try and get there you know for the for the respond to his craw PCS that the Alistar laying here for TSM has control of jungle so we can just walk straight across mid and pick up the double Scuttle crab for himself on this to Leah and is why you skip your cruggs on Tulio he just goes red into Raptors up towards his topside pushing match up there with him and is able to pull off the double Scott oh crap here he just heading straight to his response prompt you don't actually lose out a lot of time and misses him taking into account is Les matchups I get the 4 reset off right into you are the early attack damage picking up his longsword and is therefore the respawn of the crop you want to try and get your level six your forehead from he's one of the central carry points for this match up as we said in champ select the heck rum the Camille the big hairy power here for flyquest bottomland very CC heavy looking for more supportive plays we see multiple Realms coming out as a sword art just made one up towards mid now diamonds following but they did have some Vision pre-existing here for TSM that's what I lay down on his first half of the ALCS throughout the entire year you can see the link down below twitch.tv / flyquest if you want to keep track of that and watch in not English you know they're the Run of that one so he's going to meet with speaker right now and a season start that he's in peace out not much you can do here since six Liquors just recalled he's got teleport available can join but Palafox burning that flash with a pass from sword art is actually really big as Oriana already has to worry about kill combinations Wentz injury hits level 6 dangerous spot his wave is pushing up towards the enemy position plus he has no flash for himself if he always looking at level 6 the only reason he still aggressively push it like this and it's going to be able to get this wave in is because he has the double control works on both sides so he knows even though powerview lancets time there's no kill threat coming through here and it's going to be up to sort are in TSM to try and clear out some of this Vision to really take advantage of the flashes orellana Diamond sets up near the bed and they look for kanakuk not going to find it there a speaker shows up to help with the war clear who any waiting on the shield then landed the Q good time either on the Gangplank but overall they recently licorice was slain by a lot 5 PS is more than once in the slaves we still can be pretty comfortable over-there as his being recalled come through DSM 6 minutes and I'm going to still look at bottom Scuttle and maybe a chance at an early dragon as we can bring the spy and says that if I'm out I'm still going to keep talking up there early start shoes dones with PVP damage up quite a lot to me
the guardians but they have changed things up know they're figuring out ways to get it inches through flying or broken play try to pick on hot surface they have figured out how to at the very least neutralize the bottom light is not Monumental as damages from FBI as it was in the previous series and importantly or last two games they have taken FBI off of a true carry threat he has been locked on Santa and it is at the band again I want to see golden Guardian Spanish please do not go to the same draft you just lost on three times in a row and and they are not been able security for TSM if golden Guardians go to Santa again I will be so disappointed honestly I feel like guess I'm really kind of figured it out yes will the Guardians 2/10 of course thank you a different pic it is not the Senate this is something that is going to give U agency will she be able to adjust as far as that the support pick to protect its Ash that is going to be with us because with Calistaespecially if it is paired alongside something like the thresh worth Liotta again that can be a very aggressive All In Style against the ask similar jungle Gardens tried to pull off in the previous game but with work Lane agency Whitmore Village is no ball and more of a stable Pick 3 from PSM last game like the golden Guardians candy has a lot more against it is important for the team fighting over wrong you're not playing you know squishy back line damage which is what we've been doing a lot of here I'm curious if the rush comes through or some kind of different team flight answer looks like 10:10 get dicey in the mid game when he starts this more attack damage but like teepees give me the name of the game for this game and we'll see how he can perform because his last tenant game with remember was against steel Gmonstrously strong game there are nine kill Kevin game where he actually ran over CLD so the text Ralph is split so is tied or at least was tide coming in this series with Laura Kaiser protectant for his mostly see what a paring is going to be you know is it going to be something new something spicy or is it going to be more of a stand origin of French style pick up in a little bit weird for them if you bat Morgana then they can just go thrash any kind of cell found in the counter because they have the next pick they may be willing to go to words of Tom kench and if you're okay with that then jerk that's right you go to work with TK and play that defensive style that you will be sitting pretty much all control in that Dooby Doo coming outMonte has brought it out in the past week off also goldenglue playing it yesterday so okay they're going to fly into send look at a weight on support and go for counterfeit with marker has gone I thought we were going to see fresh I thought we were going to do that come through with a okay we're ready to go like you can play it was a few days but no no no we're going for Lake Domino's in the mid lane we're going to have magic damage deletion coming through trying to FaceTime can check in and say look pick up live and they want to bully at on kitchen light right back to it this is one of his most played all time he is really well known for this draws so many zillion bands has been monstrously good on its rather than Tire career newest 72.4% win rate across 29 games he hasn't nearly 10kt as well as is more kind of like I don't want to get counter picks and if you're worried about the thrash cuz you think they could go Tom can soon after getting it into this does go okay but my issue with the bar compared to something like this rash is it I really have the same kind of reliable defensive utility right and I think that's get them is basically saying we're going to depend on your shin to be able to keep the ash alive but the amount of dive that is here is really Red Barn plus Ash you know what ya with Pantheon or even if they went with rush I think I should break like a Zyra SS or biofrost and if your bottom line losses this game as TSM there is not a beer can orianna to just like take over the device as far as the damage output is required he's not he's not on Oriana just going to buy again so SS has to do well in lane at 2nd Ave e that worthy Target of getting buffed out then sped up and res Garden do diving kill him and this is a mash-up that's going to be interesting to watch for here I would say silly and is it a kind of pic into Central we talked about Tom ketchel zillion just does that thing by altering the Target and send it to me again where you can revive them we're going to trade Olson that's going to be okay with us the double bombs done versus the cinder East Dundee that's going to play out down the line but you really can ruin a lot of the golden Guardians play style what might happen to you on this side as we kind of wait for the game to play out make the players to load in and for us to get gameplay footage is how kind of AOE can the Golden Gardens Tampa right now because unless you change done whatever is going to be revived back to full HP and if you blew 421 and got nothing you lose that fight every time but if I can get for people to 20% health and then you're ready for the follow up with hurricane Calista when I was the only take one person that matter the teammates are dead Devil comes back out but he's like oh I'm surrounded got it okay I'm Dead 2 for the second time and what they actually look like as the game plays out I'm also to be super excited to see about Frost can pull off one of the the really kind of strong defensive tools for The Bard against the kennet because you can prevent the Canada flag by simply Aldean right if you can spot him coming in for a team fight and actually Alton before he can get in on top of your team that can buy you time to create space actually back up from that Kenan disengage out and you have to remember that similar to how the Caitlin bar combo work so you could do the same thing with Dillion you all someone and you drop two bombs on their head they come out they both immediately attach the same person you are set on you take that damaged so if you do get hit as you're trying to fly in with the E on Kenneth by that bar all to bits is a very easy turn on to that guy I believe there's there's anything a skin reaction here cuz this is my recollection of seeing a zillion thrash in the same game if you are bars open in town if you're standing right click and you're in range and Lantern you will grab it in time I think you may still be done but you will actually fly out I believe that is like there like a good frame allowed to click that lets me win but yes I mean no stopping the pain the case when he's very important I'm also curious if there going to be a locket in this game was going to buy it because if not a lot of good virus. It's really good against either way we've got a lot to talk about in this game it's game 5 of this back the last game of the weekend here for the LCS and it's an elimination battle the loser of this game is Dunder 20/20 season is over between the 4th and 5th season of the LCS 2020 Summer split regular-season dies and have not made world since 2017 and it would be another year on that market to fill to close this one out on the golden Guardian side they won their first playoff series ever go against TSM themselves and need to do it again to move on to phase Cloud9 next weekend for the LCS is third and final world spot Cloud 9 win the winner will see if I can come through we are out of the rift it's just going to be so exciting and I agree there so many turn things I want to talk about I doubt we saw speaker have this incredible nidalee game last game but we talked about how did Ali can look if you don't get ahead last game he got ahead it looked incredible everything was going his way we'll see if you can actually replicate that same pics s this time around we also have the bar W starts with starting to Healing strides dropped all three four beers in in the mid length it doesn't wait to essentially you know 225l there about 4 the nurse is a health potion and a bit so it is quite as soon as you get more levels becomes pretty eating a simple when you have more men into your stuff on the Back 9 in 1 shot that but the early laning does if you have quite a quite a bit of practice actually far more effectively Yorktown obviously one of the best in the business at playing this Champion do and and then we just got to watch this bottom leg is FBI on Cliff that you know the champagne is one that really can take over I can dominate the game and they have is killed by laying against the ashes Bard we're going to be very much on the back but we're going to have to see the bush I want to see if it would FBI off of the Santa can't he just run over this game can you get the map update advantage of Snowball the Dragon's Nest secure a spot in the background it is of course the early game for this list to build hail of blades you sometimes need legal Tempo not surprised gopher leaned on it ruined you pick a champion to do when laying the trash can do very good overall I can go well. He's running cleanse cuz you're probably just dying to ignite plus ballista combo so it makes sense there even though you're not against and asked if he picked himself but them to watch for have it also means that his you know first he he like I'm going to be lower if there's ever a flag or something but look at the Hopland Focus from tsf they have pushed concert in tirely off the wave he is bleeding Farm United get XP on the Canon I just barely walk in the rain to that one friend level 3 but so much pain we still don't be afraid of what's going to be to go for it looking for a Joplin maybe from the side that's it but hunter is bleeding gold and leaving at people speak about the top side and I love that even over commit to it will see if you commit to this level two closers going to Live skit First Blood and broken play T-Pain sound so hot outside your house single digit that is insane I'm not sure if they were trying to give that'll work at ashore not like watching for more time this is level 3 on the jungler on both of our leaders against level to hear to not a lot of ability to Al play Bob Ross night it was a flashlight that he does flashlight and then goes down and then probably miss thank you Auto yeah yeah and he misses slices well late actually go for the straight up kill instead of trying to fiddle around with the lantern there you know if that you landed that is a kill that is double bus going over and that is you know maybe not worth it anymore for Golden Guardian in this case you do all that great work that they did up on the top side Bounty Hunter off of everything is now a kind of for nothing because Hunter a TV advantages up in farm and now free minute if you're not going to go near closer for a few flash that could be a possibility or the wall instead so flash burn for the Rome and golden Guardian so many times in this split this year they have had a great for the game and a lot of the times they have failed to close out in the series against TSM so far they have had some stumbles in the early game but like in chocolate here they don't worry is butthole slightly off at the sweeper biofrost was spotted didn't know it and who he sadly guess is a little bit wrong in the distance very very close their eyes you say that has been there I mow incredible early game but maybe they're going to throw in the making that has been the golden Guardians that we have seen and brothers series that is actually been the opposite you know they have been losing the early games to CSM and PSM the first two games wasn't able to close out an execution down the stretch this time of his back more to that kind of standard play you are expecting out of out of golden Guardians know they have an early-game advantage we'll see what they can get done with it and thankfully for the first one so it's not as bad as it could be the person has the early Catalyst completed this is always a great item purchase when you're playing this match of the pacifically you do like it back a little bit of house to just give you the HP to get through any potential Lisa Left Eye first we can survive to get that all turned off and coasters down here again so they make it but right now on the top side of the map this going to be a plate taken and there was no Chance season 2 episode of Steve Jackson thing we saw half of the hots for the beginning of the game so you are not allowed to lose the gold Luby St Appleton biofrost Elaine Benes you expect out of fresh Calista so far so good on this side is golden Guardians will knock them another wave but now could you have a second time because now speak of must have reacted if you must be nearby controller Xbox closer easy Lantern away plate number to One Auto V my there's no length of a FBI safe for a bite so this is got to be frustrating for Dublin tomorrow for Ogden and closer has definitely been paying a lot more attention to bottling in this series and speak ass because played much more Top Lane Century style throughout this Series has been working out for them but as a result there has been a number of times we're SS bolts are falling down on the farm and table is having to secede waves. Because he's missing them or anything but because those are is there has been really good with his pressure on the bottom side rough the games and no really trying to play that role of a facilitator he is not on the. Of time you go to be playing a koala bear table is laying that is his job you know when compared to a used to be super strong and powerful almond doing all these things clothes are just wants to get the wings going Medusa with the blue bump and dump right there as Demonte gets the expected pick up there going to be another archangels pick up here on the mid lane going for more raw 80 it's more bursts overall stations off and also it's more defensive it's just a Lil Bit
Deanne flyquest here hoping that this one is going to be closer than the previous I got to say looks like bark C I also would have sent toward best jungler in the LCS to split this man is absolutely incredible. Wayne Odyssey top four or five is really stacked with hard to say but really hot really good players all around here honestly I mean it's definitely easier this this year as Mark was alluding to to say that someone got robbed in every single position selectos because it's really important for this matchup specifically obviously everybody always focuses on hunie as a very chant to lek Reliant play as he has had some very bad game off of his main Champions Rumble Gangplank but also for flyquest they bring some interesting thing is really high tendency toward rakan they areare the teams that more aggressively used those IR Con in a world where the 80 carat pool has been whittled down more not going to be the case here because Caitlin is left up obviously number one pick right now with the extra range and ever since she got her attack damage and health boost she's just such a price of one that they always put your lane Pokemon your Tower Whittle away at those Tower placed and Kobe I think it is a new patch it started this round of playoffs and right now among sort of top regions like read about not ask you do group said that major event only the LPL in the LPS have played yet know very small sample of what other teams think is good off of times LCS insulator to a patch that we can watch your a play a whole week for example for coming into the champ select kind of blind not the one other thing as good as I got to work todaythe LPS only care about the champion over in China for example of course more Konica filling out an entire bracket because the proteins themselves stay on a later patch for much longer and it takes longer for them to update to 1016 definitely a lot of credit to Demonte if you're picking up sticks so quickly maybe we'll see something new here so far nothing new koala bear is actually one of the ones that got nerfed pretty hard I really have been lamenting the movie Speed Nerf bat Volver. I kind of dropped him from my personal roster but it is still a flex Pick 4 so I expected to be in the hands of Santorum though he's done great things so far they split with the championa lot of early game presents you can get in there even without the speed still very valuable with your single Target sign in the first image that you can put out early on vulva bear is that he is only a jongleur now that he's been there Farm enough that I think there's just enough other better top winners bad to flex stick isn't reliable enough that you just talk later end of the day but of course that's just it up there what's a little size are the flags supposed to be exercising for CG right now just throwing top 10 Ben 10 banned by the way they also believe that the volunteers at 5 to take right and it remains to be seen as well that's like throwing their bands off at Uni Graves arguably the king of the jungle with the nurse new set and we'll be coming through as well throw a benefit our people for the Corky instead and that means as a kind of picked you Pee Wee's Oriana last time these teams played Evil Geniuses through four band at Power of evil and then he still picks Corky and they tracked them sothey actually forego all the other four pants and they're just painting the Corky it just checking around here versus there toward possibly then setting up for another as your pic or something like that for gold options I personally still really like his doughy I'm also a very good Blind Pig mid there but honestly the top three blind pigs Oriana azir Zoe these easy things are all available for him I thought this up to what style of game they want to play well look at the style that they want to play it might be around Top Lane split push keep in mind you still break even know who he didn't have the best meal game last time I suppose competition we've got the dalio in the midline and golden is here to help someone died visits aren't things out of your lineup against Callie from golden blue looks like it's going to bedefinitely likely it's going to be in this way comes out here for flyquest these are after the changes to wear but made a few changes to the damage or you're going to get more do more damage Pastor Jeff seems like the coolest lowers to get more damage and of course the W range is something like 4,000 you could walk through the brush next to your lane and you'll be in late in spirit hecarim I think it's for the best champion in League of Legends and play Dempsey's Evil Geniuses I think can take over this game on neck ropes with the galley over-the-top and specifically freak it's not justBlind Pig hecarim hear what you said because hecarim best Ketone is either conquer or phase recipes with mostly more for the jungle 5 expecting who need to go conquer you can stack up the helicopter cues on shed just keep on spinning on him with your conquerors backing up and you don't have to worry as much about the spirit Spirits refuse the auto attack of blocking W-4 shed and heparin can utilize the Moose. Lee well to dodge taunt it's a big part of shen trying to get trades on you if you dodge the time if you if he doesn't want that means he probably can't get his cue pass through which takes so much of the damage out of a sense trading out of the very least shun can try to block devastating charge which is a decent chunk of the birthday Matt there in the heck is well put ya que is just your spin it around and and that's not getting blocked by Doug Stone very very strong Champion now headed to the acronym people do run ignite up in the Top Lane because you can just use your old or you eating away from gangsterhave to run flash or even ghosts are you can just run more damage and kill Champions off Jen's going to build armor natively he's going to build some durability there that the health of Titanic Hydra and Sunfire cape look he can cut it with Stan but this is going to feel very high crime favorite I like this it allows to UNI to play very very heavily in a side length but he comes down it's hardened gauges not you know the squishy Camille who like hope she can sit in the old enough to kill someone off Hector is going to get in there he's going to get a bunch of durability the big tanks. For ekrem is his W-2 at the heels are so it takes damage around him heels for four like 30% of the damage dealt which means he will drain take off your team coming in after you a champion to look like a lot of fun and with two of the core items Trinity force and Destiny ants when you get your desk dancing you are one of those Juggernaut lifesteal tanking types of Champions in addition to the W makes him very sustained oriented so Grievous wounds are pretty important vs. champion especially later on once a distance is completed absolutelyprobably 10 minutes or so far since the bus East Falls awfully like 30 you kind of Spike on your first two and then he's already W like the regular sub isn't very good and so they like ultralight gave you're not 600 Camille you don't like that that kind of falls off of it but your first 20 minutes going to feel amazing when he's definitely a classic Trinity Force spiking Champion we have a little bit of delay with a game that's why I were waiting right now but honestly I really curious to because hecarim of the other things that you have super long range where you can stop Shin Stand United not only do you have your move speed boost With Yuri which was bust at the top end but also a super long range with your ultimate and your ultimate provides an extended fearnow the longer that you travel with it that actually got bucked at the maximum range so you can go interrupt the shed Stand United and then unlike a lot ofChampions that might die you know under Tower of the send turns around and taunts them I can kick it out while the sun is is still feared from from his own ultimate so it's not as dangerous going for deep inner up well going to be a lot of fun the games begin and champions like is complete. The jump a T-Rex playoff series is flyquest it once again faces off against Evil Geniuseshello and welcome back to the Series game 1 of estify between flyquest and Evil Geniuses these teams are two Best of Both Worlds if you win here today anyways next weekend against Team Liquid or cloud nine that is a spot at the 2020 World Championship now the heavy favorites here against TG most because I have seen Heaven 3-0 and their favorite however I have faith in the heck room I have faith and go to the recipe for geniuses to be exciting game and I know freak you just have this infatuation you love this Champion I definitely like it as well especially now it's so cute but I think that other interesting side of it is on like Westside this Wayne did this is kind of a ridiculous that has not been seenyou know since the sensory worker needed before the rework or a before this mini rework whatever you want to call it and it was extremely rare so I'm super excited to see what part of people can do with this Champion the main thing I know about playing with it was actually when I was doing with my boy big Terry former talk about support and he was just like okay main thing is when he comes to try and use a coupon you to snare you actually walk forward him to it yes he will take the damage but that's the snare only stance the last thing hit if you play in the minions and walk up into the minions and it just stares the minions and you can get off a better grade as galio you can probably use that moving get your queue on the minions as well as for Here solo course running with grass tear in the later to get some help back but overallwhat is mostly Straits will say hecarim can run out of Mana he's got he's a fairly Mana hungry Champions but obviously you can do runes on ization get through some of that one at WGU link happen if things are monsters but it's still a good I think it's kinda help that rank one so good to stay in there regardless and Hulu shows in the wave gets out of the 12 CS then we'll see how well still looking last hit under turret I did some looking at so what you went right. Swain is the third worst matchup in all of the gov Legends for Midland galio based on win rate of the other ones would be Nocturne and set that was banned so there you goand I just looked up season 10 it looks like only Mickey and whippo for LEC in Spring where the two Twain plays so none in summer does far and how people would be the first to receive a cake I said it already has not matter what you try for three minutes waiting is Off to the Racesdown hoody is running out of resources here has a biscuit if he needs it can finish the shove but looks like receiving pretty early TV back to land in the second is heat races help are out for a mini Bush and yours a bank yeah we get the POV from San Torrance right through the brush fire of evil set that up there's no chance for goldenglue to flash anyting what I was talking about earlier with the Q staring the last thing that it hit go to go try to run away from it as the tip of it hit for power of evil he pulls them right back in before goldenglue can get out of there Flash in from santorin that is great no CC layering from this jungle Duo and it really worked well together to get black box where they are today a little right place right time for centaurion See Is Gold and blue and fence guard when I get to his side of the jungle look sad don't you dare they want they're going to back up their Lanes but at least thinking about for a bit of jungle control nothing else take a look at the bottom late bang and zzz Olympic as well throw an ignorant I will say I favor Caitlin is Wayne a fair bitso far things are going pretty well as well check the brush to see you soon as around there and he is rough not pulling back just yet so then they will still at camp and now and I could have damaged hear the Trap was on basil take busy every single skiltron I like that later for Dresher Auto attack really heavy trade in Basel going to come through the last two posts if they've been just taking out his to stay now you get to know supplement that Caitlin play style that we kind of talked about pushing the link continue to poke them under and we sent Zanesville is so low they should be able to force Bank to miss some of the Cs now thus far as he's done just buying grabbing them it is going to get more difficult of santorin also over on this side of the map to kind of give svenskeren a little back for the counter jungling & eggar with the pushing Lane on bottom for flyquest makes sure he's safe to do so ignore going to help make sure yes indeed Central and gets the girl
talk about it that oh why is he died from flyquest and by the time we saw Caitlin polar bear and fresh that is just really good League of Legends champion and they had to call their shot weight rent an office as well for anti dive sucks to be galio yeah I think more credit should be given to the side of flyquest for good drafting on blue side in blue 545 there in answering immediately once they saw galio there like I could we get the anti. We have the teeth after pics Wayne + Shay for extra anti dive and then they don't care what the last Vikram easy would be so really well done by flyquest from blue side now they're on the right side where they get to save a counter fixed and I'm excited to see you at what they can pull out generally I have liked solo actually getting the counter pick because tired of you both had so many blind pick options45 Anza in peace still is always able to perform on your stuff sort of high damage a secret from him and taking out a couple of the priority pics and obviously very closely associated with him for the entire year they throw the Caitlin been in there as well so he grabbed set across all right now grapes and Caitlin van across the LCS and LDL as those who remain fairly high priority why Quest grab the set is in there we'll see if I'm going to go ahead and take this crazy something else as well but like Westgate now two games in a row has the highest priority 80 Careybadass here and especially if you have wild turtle while turtle is accuracy with global ultimate has been a strong point for his whole career and this man has had one of the longest League of Legends careers as players play we do get the trifecta. This is a very common Champion pick guess it Diane work on were designed for each other but they really really good but supplemental Champion that's very often pick with Doric on because set flanks that ultimate AOE grouping works so well with the speed of work on its it's a very very easy to AOE CC lock them for big Zaya play collarscan be for me to watch for their yeah I like stop a lot to be a lot of damage bank is going to be on his Bruce's buy a pic of the split finally off of Elias off of Israel for this one now instead flyquest in the first game and was going to be left on the table here with you have a bank and do alongside Basil Ford furqan got to go bus over recent history as well we'll see if that can look good for him and now we wait around next little bit as the second phase to fix Advance come through flyquest not convinced that will be a top of the Gangplank and Corky again out on the Evil Genius yep trying to take away a few of the POV scaling Champion with mordekaiser top already and a volibear jungle they are going to have you no decency top sites to already top 5 mandation for honey good look pretty focused on Magic resistantdon't you think about things around mordekaiser though it's an interesting thing was a Kaiser that early then you have to start worrying about you know you don't really want to pick Champions that are reliable atan synergies as he can break so easily you also don't want to get yourself into a place where you need to get dragon's feels cuz mordekaiser just easily denies those by ultimate jungle I'm so genuine want to have more Dragon priority for your focus there as well so I'm looking at so that you dated for bad matchups for mordekaiser and one that sticks out to me is a colleague of your as well and Jack's in the one on one player who wants to play those kinds of Maple Theater come through the grass comes in as well at auction. Maybe a couple months ago bigger a PE ratios on some of his spells and I mean I've seentell me this is at midlane gragas please please please I really want to see a full AP gragas Wide Shut how do you sleep when it when it was the norm people hated it but it's been so long since we got each other really well played gragas combo one shot of obviously it could very easily be support and this is definitely something that ignore would play so I I'm kind of edging more towards it is support for I guess you know for the for the body plan for the inner up there also ultimate proof good at that disruption of the 80 bus that were made to it I I really would hope for its has our like 2% though because baby mullet support fragments down there but we'll see what Graphics going to be what's going to come alongside the composition of right now is the pic into a zeroset the drawer was Nerf in 10.16 20 leskiw damage at Max rank is definitely pretty medieval base damage hit so still staying in all this is a really important not to fit into his ear by the way not favoured into mordekaiser lose a lot of things that match with pacifically another one where game long has not favored he was also true into shed his back but as a game state record does not typically like going against that champion right. Not great Hector may be isolated to can't be the front lines can also be problematic here but you want to see what happens I still like cockroach baby not as much with these matchups yeah and I think I've done a good job of stacking their answers for the reckon since is our kind of shone so early you know they pick up the syndra always like that as a midline option in to work on later on your scout of the week is so good versus the Recon and Recon really does have to get a kind of fed toto have the answers to have the money to make things like Sonia's and stuff to do immune Center Olsen and avoid getting on your birthday and it puts more pressure on the rakan using control words using Vision to find really good flanks and more surprised positions the crisis is such a good answer always love to see it with your body slam in the flash place that you can pull out I want to take a step back and look at season 20 20 because I think my favorite change of the season was the support of changes were you buy it to your one and you can buy it real item from there so you can actually play the elevation gain is an upgraded to face them out and whatever else it's the season where you can more easily get to Azure stopwatch or whatever else he'll agree with you that it is hard to be work on in the world with mordekaiser insyndra trying to kill you instantly gragas down and support role who's going to make it difficult as well so excited to see how he is going to play out to be a lot of fun here as flyquest bring out some more chance if you don't see very oftenokay I see no sweepers for anybody so probably I know no weird stuff with the delayed invades or anyting should be defensive Wards trying to cut off both of the they speak in our body slam over-the-top he gets the ward and he slips in behind the Red Bluff you can go right behind Azle you want a bait and you show in the river for Azazel and then you both got the same time are the girls going to push him in case we going to run right into this Champion knocked up son could buy at night is on anyway what a absolutely beautiful level one game plan from flyquest Gloria stuff right there. He has $400 gold and those are always the types of things that that ignore likes to go for it to you know even even if he's a recording he'll like wopraying on defensive opening because so many teams that the same defensive screening opening just watching the entrances from the river broadcast has not been picked in quite a long time as a support I date guys able to get just over the back of the Dragon pit making sure of course you want to go over the upper kind of part of the back of the Dragon pit so that the person inside Rush can't see you ignore did just that and we saw all how it went down perfect timing on the pincer he doesn't show until he's in range for the body slam and that is critical because it gives enough time for same pouring to get there with the volibear stunt followed up and have just enough damage with a night to take him down even going over the wall and if you don't start right there for a little bit easier as a few difficult ruin on ash down there so it's going to be nice next rigali and a half and Lady face really hot shots expected as well going to track out what's been Stearns doing in the jungle they'll see your RedditDawnville see he's doing red to Bluetooth from the jugular playing against Ash it's great I love it the Drone is over my head giving away all information to my opponents Alex and Torrence and know that he can go for another drink or just passed around through mid try and get some D provisioned about that right now against Ash like like at this point in time go to Blue was dead and he was against 313 great flash by still look at some of the stunts but there's still a summer to spell down all right top pressure they're still finds its marked and against the most common top later right there oreimo comes outbottom side should be that Horan area to play I think he should be well aware though that the map is flip a trade Scuttle crab so they's One Bank able to flip their way out no problem and not a big deal right there go to the first shove in 29 CF pretty good only drops to on the first five West on the backside here even though you have if your opponent mid laners put stuff like that you're as your guest the shelf on to send you as much as your super sneaky there if you've been able to get behind them in the brush unaware there's nothing you can do because you're so far away you lose that to be to you have to run for the hills and it goes have a recall since Karen take the early very small i c s Lee finished up his Raptors is a little bit delayed on the recall though so since worn with the early upgrade into Smite here so he will be able to have a little bit better Chase Burns through his manifold air gets a deep Ward and sees the crugs respawn top sites and we'll know about to the Jungle pathing down the line from santore both involve for Top Lane Farm pretty close between the two will be so is punished for Flash being down otherwise with the gang set men ultimately nothing not going to change the ones you want all that much and who he actually going for a sophomore defensive abilities is not Building compared to the cry for she's going early specters Powell to be tanky against the law in a notch up and we'll see where it goes from there and I got to talk about in champ select since they have no volibear does a decent of a bee damage an 18 did to the whole top side of the map is a p so fast and furious this is super easy for me to buy straight from just seeing those early for 3 pick was Kyle but Catholic part of beige and part of threads and I'll do the rest later on right now send Troy walking up right through control we're going to go knock that one down still open the door for the trade is it comes up behind him who do will be back in score stood for the TV back to land solo did the same with his arm guard so he's actually got kind of the item that he wants for his match up receipts that doesn't do magic damage either so very efficient for his side of an app I'm really curious to see how this ends replace out to some already harveyville is struggling and this is 1016 where the extra syndrome Nerf did also come in you know you have your max rank on your darksphere really huge takes 20 damage off that thing and Arville not his game to go back to it but already struggling a little bit early with this year and I wish I could see the rooms from it as a one-v-one fight here in the death row from solo who needs down to four already feels about that one of them starts back in the office and they're coming one level ahead so might you got that one that you're going to ignore this Waters around so I can get a couple of grew up in time ignore was there for the combo and flyquest start-off 3 + 0 distracted that they were like playing next it's for the Scuttle Crab race or something to get that body playing flash right in time they get the first flood I mean they get the extra extra two kills cuz they had already gotten up early for a sled with his body slam over the dragon this describes pick just making all the plays for sequestered another look at it the race up the river to join the Stella crab Harvey benignity can see they force Azazel out even though he had been there almost the same time and on your screen of course there's a recalling azir since Marvel is there and EG midliner not going to Rome up easy win for flyquest they are the exit numbers Advantage you may have gotten a little crab but we got the kills ya very very standard support room timings is the first recall at 6 in the bot Lane until after I've your BF Play Imma grab Food To Go Topless to you later and so they are both are but this route if you mention kiwi house going to do this time around he had to push first in mid right you was able to go and go to lose stuck in lane and that was the difference of those two cases of 380 syndra and with a bunch of extra ability power you just made up
what's the poor Trump with our people they sell them out from that fight they get to kills they just snowballs snow effectively and put a stop to eat at every turn the drafts of also been extremely good from flyquest you know the Swain early we met them multiple times but even the groggett you know as another angle coming in another surprise will be able to take they're not really respected by EG and they get punished for it and move on to Kaiser band now it again is actually a pretty solid picking hecarim overall David you really want to keep playing that one Champion well I'm work as a band does make sense of that what you're seeing Marksman band come through for flight with it again this time they are dropping the Calista off the table as well think so pretty solid from and we get the instant set pick up this time you will still have the project and its chance like what's a whole lot like game 2yeah even those that was nerfed I mean it's been used so well by both solo Ant-Man torrent still pricing that as a takeaway pic but and going right back out to follow their he's had some stuff with it already I know all the early play as I have been dead for successful has kept himself alive the entire series as well as it does for Superstar assist jugular santorin so far 10209 last time can be very very good I think it really does work with a dive composition the question is can fly Quest answer what I'm actually getting to be a dive comp based on these be fixed can they make things happen what's the third pick and Abby are they going to grab an early on stop playing Pixel Force Band away and try to get it so a lot of ityeah cuz they let the both the Gangplank and the rumble so so it's kind of throwing it down here already alright do you really want to pick the game Plank and do I write accident we are going to try and drive you kill you or rejected volibear is such an incredible 2 V 2 no matter what EG try and run on the top side there's the Gangplank pants coming through will they also the rumble up there I feel likedenturist what hecarim break about 6 because the farthest theories and it feels like that's where they were looking right now though support bands are coming through for Evil Geniuses the gragas from last game the 4th is still available I will see that come through some point but part obviously highly prized very very strong was played in game 1 of semen sample of playmaking champion he's been so good for congress all these types of things with the engage so see what they pull out here as your bed away from goldenglue Amigos with the Zoe or something then it's dead I mean if they do have the descendants VK kind of safety bottomland so cold include he's going to have to do a large amount of damage if they want to kind of you don't have those big game device to pull them off5/4 according to the GPS on the backside gear Blacklist I don't have any reason to early pichkari I think they are better boys grabbing their support and waiting but I reckon not a huge shock right here very good engaged tools rakan Renekton and polar bear even ask for the top getting really good in there of course pumpkins to keep people safe pain center can feel sick on her gate apricot also can jump over walls the back but now you really got if you have to focus on those are all right well spindra is left up as the most common orianna counter pick and with Oriental locked in for goldenglue of course it stillgo forward. I find your magic isn't real friends in a row there's on it like based on composition this actually would make sense this is sort of what the cop looks like Santa is great when your teeth and diving in and no I like this is it going to be locked in and goes to nard yeah I really would have liked that too because if you're showing so much utility already sent her a lot of the Laker game is no comeback for healing also she does have a really good rains going Oriana with the extra fuel up in front of you till you can bring with play making with this Champion later would have been cool to see who he has played a lot of Nar throughout his career throughout his ears even at Worlds with SKT and he's going to be doing it once again here in many forms you have to be worried about flashes coming through with a Renekton volibear cuz that could be a really scary combo if they get a flash done on you you are dead other than that though you should be ablekeep your distance hyper digits of buff for a tax speed sonar can utilize it to be really annoying and fried you know keep your range with it the boomerang spam allows you to also play defensively if you aren't we decide you know your junglers already down bottom and you know that there is going to be pressure around so it is a pretty versatile pic but later into the game you also have to play around that rage bar in coordinating with your team shirt know there's a lot more things to think about a lot of things to give up for sure I want to point out that since three games in a row that I believe who he has gotten himself counterpick and this is the first time of those three his Champion is actually favored to win a game of League of Legends against his Lane opponent not saying though the match up in landcape me the case but overall game impact we saw the shed. I've come for example all that stuff can you can make it really really tough right here so now we expect her to do well in protected in line or these pretty decently then also obviously teamfight prowess with the comp around is the first time I feels when he's actually sayto do well so I'm curious to see this is what it takes for you to come around again we expect Cinder to be good at the Oriana but Sandra was heavily nerves and if he's not given First Blood at level one if he's not giving a double kill at level four you might see Golden Honey Bunch better time in this Lane and e g I do think have a draft that we can get behind and be excited for is he they can pull back the series yeah they're going to have to get is flyquest new model of the hashtag go deep but it is eg that have to dig deep right now because they are back's against the walls are going to go down to the lower bracket it's it's looking really scary for them right nowhow to help a TG can play against one win in game 3 music and play a game for otherwise they are down to lower bracket with a date against hundred they'll play that this weekend by the way dignitas first TSM is tomorrow is tomorrow at the same time and place off the fact that yes indeed golden Guardians 3 o t s m and EGR about to face that same fate staring down the barrel of a 300 at the hands of flyquest to the battle title 3-2 are just constantly taking notes how can we get some day to the clap Hootie is heart of solo has been how could we get everything else to go well with Wyoming arrest the crew need to win to keep themselves in the chance of holding I can never buy Cat spot flyquest looking to knock them down here and now immediately started laughing because we talked about a chance like was a those watching that wall light right again as wellis going to be normal start this time around and no possibilities of those level one and a bit more sense Karen and since we're both starting bottom side so if it didn't really want to do you can do blue buff Rob red bumps on volibear you do it really quick cuz it's just a single Target camps with your machetes and you can immediately run up to try and punish Mooney Narcan Bush Renekton early it's super annoying with the range advantage in the boomerangs but I like I was saying if you get up there with a jungler with flash you get up there at level 3 with Red Bluff they can double flash on the on the minion are in even if the other junglers there you win the to be too because the double flash you can layer your CC you could kill a minion are before I can transform uni has worked up his rage bar though and we'll see how well he can keep it lasting and Lane was going to try and stay de autos for thatKahuna Fleet footwork going to be running around trying to type and keep doing the damage 11 out of 12 CS going to be the start good job so low with Dash by the way to get in and out of those fights and gets the F without taking too much damage that match up, it's done right there I think it's working for the hills when needed so nearby they saw it when you walk down to the tribe has really wanted to pull that gank off then he could have run the long route through the river but it made me think that they didn't actually want to go for the yank his whole purpose there was To Kill The Ward they do the word was there he just went to efficiently sweep it and look what it's causing it's causing some extra time since Karen kind of hovers up there waiting for it now possible fight over the bottom crab Midland goldenglue so looks like it should be a dentist scan in the crab fight against the ward knocked out as well so that's going to stay or go to do I get to push So Good by santore get away from this onefour cans of peas benefits can't go to spend that one first and it is in Turin out running the other side of the map to look for walls and second Scott or something it's not going to be it'll be all excited for the guy has been so he's like I can't get the crap either devil crabs. Or empty as being in Basel there a little bushline up pretty easy to take it for themselves as well I always goes nice to get the the Devil's Double strap with the extra safety and leave santorin with a lot fewer options cuz he did kind of reverse clear back down here no more cancer from the take only his present or up so you just going to sit there with no extra cancer taken these kind of forcing of the possible think they're on to Oriana think better of it and just has to return to the crop I really like this Landing by Bangin basil is hard to do if you don't get really really good farm at Bank of a recall off of five waves right wave number 8 3 6 9 12 oz can of waves going to recall in theBeast of a can of refried beans going to recall on 5 or the 5th Wave write any medicine recall on the 5th Wave with enough money for a pickaxe you did not get that without very good CS 32 CS gets really really good Mark by Ben well done to him if you don't have Mechanics Bank you're not going to get that kind of Rico and so he's able to get in line at a certain time he lost 3 melee minions and how we going to have to have a recall this boat in sight for a while and he's going to get a lot of Lane pressure I think we should expect an early break out of Spencer enough pressure that she look really good easy side bun I slept right here from hunie twiddling solo down probably going to force a Teleport Rico husband he's doing good job keeping up that pressure and looking good right now for so long already down that potion to heal back up to 1/2 HP svenskeren does have a reason to be topside get a gun as he's burned through stop jungle once again without any word coverage theoretically write a 1/2 health fieldAmazon flash available dogs away the boomerang he's okay but did you really see who he is putting her down right there and so was trying his best to pick up the scraps and to be fair and equal and see us so not too bad. Just yet because it's been one charge of his race by so close to turning into Mega that it's not as scary as we're talking about before where the flash would mean instant death on 608 from Megan or you are just you could know about and Well Done Right There the XP could have been truck but it could play fight who would he gets to spend the wall Goodfellow I spent staring The First Time all series EG gets first Blood between mini and that's why he wasn't scared they even had things down on the river looking for it who did you just turn to the juicy jungle are coming up you hit Level 6 off of this minion he's able to get that last melee kill immediately turns for the chill out of the level 4 jungle are so so nice to hear for EEG cuz they had really been getting destroyed in the series now they've got a nice early game to work off of my right is a fence Care on Garfield it more comfortable at the fact that he's got the same boots that his opposing Champion has been touring but you better recall it was more gold in the pockets right now who's going to pick 3 call hilai Portable Buildings and their Rico 6:40 into the game. Late other threats Eternal thankfully for himself has teleport to get back to recall he's going to try to recall the wave is in front of his door and it doesn't get better break their winning in Top Lane that they are winning in bottom line is looking really good right now and I do like that Golden Globes going with the more scaling Oriana option where you start a few early heading towards the seraphs it's it it does have a little bit weaker than your other man options but I just love Sarah so much with the transform especially with with Oriana added the extra shield for yourself later let you use your your ball in your positioning so much more offensively yeah but you can stay alive and get those Shields everything else going to feel comfortable there power people just be one until we get the better of it the 210 CS at under eight minutes for three calls come through Forty Thieves come through as still look at ninja tabi and double longsword so it would stand a lot more the damage and he's like well I'm a recall any way it was before the big year old who cares knock it out to Binion's I'm going to come back and get my items to yeah she answered pretty quickly to with a cell phone so I was pushing fast pushing in on that wave to try and force it did you see if that was a no way yeah so there's going to be a small distinct beer for flyquest in their favor for solo but not going to be a very big deal and 1/2 minutes in a bit normal for Rift Herald spawn as
blue side of the chance for WECT changes for flyquest Iran blue side already right out of the gate yet they are going to start targeting bang I think bang and Zanesville is one of the best parts of EG and they showed that they can dispense can completely focused on Hootie and work off of the top side of the map thing as basil will be just fine on the bottom side they're really intelligent about how he manages minion wave we mentioned slow push last time I got a big bounce back and have a nice recall and so Calista off the board again for them never going to let Bank in his hands on that one but it looks like everything else shouldn't be availableyeah they're time there is a are really disgusting the chance to like to set this time around there were by the way we've been seeing very very frequently from them it's okay that first pic that's a bit much let's not let's and foreign play that one you know we can maybe Fork Caitlin on the one side but then you've got full of air on the other foot been torn down a little bit off the exterior jungle baby or baby figure out there to try to remove dominant laners and allow that pic to work on contestants now with Caitlin off the table is it okay is ityeah and honestly I would rather have the 80 Carey without how much they do carry pool has been whittled down with the with the extra nurser come in for 4:00 1016 ashurst and so strong especially with a wild throw even though in the last game did not get as many of the arrows as we have three ways he has been really good on a car there are some decent chance you can work out what I can work out well against ask people but not too bad now 6 to go for a highly prized Wrangler to your in Graves they want to keep since they're not heavy far that means a polar bear will easily go to Santo and without much pressure see if he's going to pick something out there for themselves they say what can it be I don't mind Alice Cooper's they look very good at it it looks fine to engage for the team which I think he zhi do want they tend to find themselves always playing in the teeth fight announcer death notices every night sleep by number right now I don't hate it either cuz O Bar got nerves to look very strong champion and it's time to take down this may well be the lock it and maybe okay so I was going to say put leaving put out the the Azrael there but if we have the time can't think it's a little bit less likely but I've been scared being on the graves gives him the possibilities especially early on of attacking santorin that's one of the things that the death was calling for a lot of people kind of looking at does rely on their laners as we saw on the last game goldenglue getting pushes allowing him to get the shuttlecraft and allowing eat beef to get the doubles shuttlecraft opening as being a big part of it right now flyquest eat themselves if there's pick junk was a matched up ATK one side support on the other wouldn't be surprised to see a fresh or something else a little bit defensive Turtle safe against somebody possible time to come through this Papi G certainly do love to dive bars to be pick up though he's early. Golden Sun on spin of Tom kench we can do that one again only problem is there going to be snow this week Falls so these sent a Synergy is not quite as strong without as many men did not give me to the golden glue really only who need to be a Freightliner really really. I've been on the team if they go with that they could try split push strategy good definitely very risky but they're on right side right they've got guaranteed counter Pick 4 if they actually wanted to do something like the Quinn like we got him hovering over last time is available on red side you can force like what to do everything first that being said I kind of do like send it whenever you have Graves on your team to ever they they spread armor for each other you have a lot of damage coming from your jugular the ultimate from Senate also from from bottom Lane even earlier in the game is is quite nice and some of those dual and I'm expecting spend are due to try and utilize the painted pin it's kind of early on a grape is actually one of my favorite Champions get to volunteer because you can Dash away from the W from the East slope as well as using smoke bomb to really mess up a lot of other bears and gate when you take away that vision is greatly all the bands of the top light taking out almost all the Looney Champions that we think of Rumble still available and Vatican right now she has very very bad engage right so I can't really do it and the graves can't really do it if you play orianna there's no ball delivery on this TV to pick up is more physical than magic that will fit knock down a couple of pegs and then what will do it when it happens and you're bringing up fall Delivery Systems CEO for orianna combos I also always look for Shen Delivery Systems because defensive Schultz are are so much more relaxed when you have really have a young male a champion to dive in there I don't really have a good deal dive in their Champion yes in the early game and made game you can use Graves super aggressively to counter jungle and it really helps to have a vent on your back bill to me like dollar rate that but later on but I don't know if they're going to be able to have the same sort of white glue generally will play more rain JP carries to hasn't been the one to take up the Assassins permit all right well Jason going to be the lock in here for the topside and out for the first time you're on Evil Geniuses and this is going to be to have a lot of horsepower you have Global being tired. Length and the top and an EEG can at least two other side the map flyquest have a more standard looking team composition my eyes are drawn by someone putting more effort and more resources into the swamp Rose free Golden Globes long history from Cloud 9 this is going to be them trying to place to / offensively because both of the sidelines are more support if you have Senna ultimate so I can come through to help you out with those to be to Shin Stand United Chene and low block is one of the most devastating in Ocilla Lane combinations and it turns your Midland into a very scary area for the Oriana cuz the block get those initiations gets those no-good Shannon spots so easily with the multiple distortions that she can pull off so this is an interesting look for EG people. When when you're stopping and goldenglue and Kumo you're taking the aggressiveness aggressiveness of your team out of the middle and now they're putting it back in with Champion Select I want to see if he can do it because all of the questions work is his lamp going to work honestly the regular-season win rate was higher with Azucar in Kubo the best later on EG so far this year has been cool if you look at the player of the game standings for Evil Genius is the leader in play the game to zukey over there. Subbed out 10 games in like there is a lot that can tell you the EG maybe was better with the other line up with after 10 games they brought this group and they stuck with it through plastic fight 202 start said no it is still these guys this is our lineup is the Players we believe in and I'll see if I can do it here in game four because it didn't game free all right yet again every single game is a must-win game before EEG the pressure doesn't let up until they're done with the reverse sweep you have to complete the entire thing pushing it to a game 5 year would be big for them because I mean this is double elimination but dropping down to the lower bracket is already pretty scary as we seen at the end of the split a lot of the lower teams have been a lot better showings and big upsets already TSM the higher-seeded team was I think three wins above golden Guardians in the regular season and Golden Gardens 300 EGR not three wins above hundred thieves and if they can't win both X Games are going to face them next up right here in and yes that is scary there is no qualifier gone at the end of summer is a new look here in the LCS spring split plaster not impact it is only how summer split playoffs go if you not make top 3 you are not going to Worlds your season is over goodbye I tried your very best in EG yeah if they if they lose the series it was on Abby's they finished 7/8 goodbye they are done that kind of what's in front of them if they can't turn things around I like the strap I think this, and totally work I think this can be very good for them but the question is can they make it work at the end of the day it could be fun to watch for the Block it's a lot on him yeah I'm super excited see if they can actually step up to what they've drafted here with the game play cuz you have to follow through on what you said out for yourself in the early game yes it does require the shed on the top side you'll get it to your level sick before you really get the full benefit and start to go for it for those inmates but already out of the gate you can go for level 1 try and get some fish and olives to set up the graves for for better jungle tracking or for invading early on Grey's with Red Bluff is terrifying you know at the early stages especially if you are mid lane match Isla block orianna orianna requires a couple of levels more points to get into W before she gets control of the minion wave a little bit easier she's much more scaling LeBlanc right out of that can set up gang super easily with Distortion chains easy defensive order here by svenskeren start the recall about 4550 switch out to sweep her off you go and it's a nice way to start things out if you want to go for a defensive jungle opening just do that were sent over here to do when your own silicon Valley's hard invade get the voice down exactly get the most out of your trinkets spot meanwhile it looks like it is going to be both bottom side start in there I thought they were actually going to add some extra damage to the to the graves clear but they're just going to start in Lane a little bit delayed the reason they're doing this they don't want to give away the opening or expense can cuz we get engraved could you start red you can go for a lot of possibilities and it kind of makes the other jungler keep that in their mind for a little bit more expensive wood that's going right now taking biscuit 0 damage fight the blubaugh can heal up against it no big problem but full of air is I can't behead right now got the really heavy leash feeling really good about going red to Raptors the knocking out whole thing out that late a straight back and forth is Pua and gold going for a trading pattern runewright matching electrocutes that when I fight comes through he can hit him back with qrow stay alive and then keep your health bar is Flowing pretty recently as my shopping done when there is 2 CC in the pattern and you know to run away from things like Graves Escape fuel pressure looks like level 2 is going to be at almost the exact same time around like a nice little cutie from banks in the angle they're right through Thursday so it's a little tag the little things in your trading in Lane when you're trying to get some damage back on on things like bar the can he's so annoying when you're running at me like support like that I'm going to be another one most likely going to get slowed float again attacked for the soul deep the damage their thing walks away almost as done they still making sure he walks to the right enough that if bardar Lanes a queue it won't go into a wall and no problem there easy walk away very small early gold lead to fly Quest I will say it's been 21 Camp ahead be the fact that a leash is really helpful for that one he's going to be in position in time for the Scuttle whereas since you're doing a full clear instead and ignoring those River camps that it will be in the total can't count will be close to tie-dye size that theory not getting rid of Auto tax to get the electric off having a good time right now products that they are both on 60 amps are you know he just got caught crab so you immediately need to get bottom crab and since you guys going to do that while the recalls going off we can get there slightly ahead of the volibear if you have to run all the way from topside rather than recalling them running from base but it is pretty close on the timing and if you're a little bit slow with you can definitely get punished so loud here kind of laying around does have the face rest so should be able to get off the recall was trying to go to the cookies how far is The Flash followed us here can't ignore is blocking the Autotext skillshots route on a car won't matter either and that TV remote approval not anything done he is out of lame eBay please some Farm but there will not be any kill those extra few seconds Spence Karen opting to run down from drugs rather than a re calling for the first purchase then heading to Scuttle crab actually make a difference cuz he is able to finish the Scuttle crab
a lot of this this Top Lane trading who he has gone past has effectuation with the heck rum Creek was all aboard so you know I think it would be sweet if ever Wins Game 5 do you know who sang I want to see whoever gets it you need to take them to Victory their butt sex pill has to offer selection off of that lost that big blue side and now let us see we're going to have for this rap I add you said she's very excited for this one and I'll see if we can make this one go throughyeah cuz there's so much you know there's so many possibilities with 1016 being so fresh on what they will put their time in the first couple games were waiting out in Kettering the galio and then they have to poop or gragas for ignore huge play making from him yet I'm just saying game this series and it was the first time or the double 80 carry back your ass and Caitlin clearly talk to you for everybody's money this opens up more possibilities than I really still like by reekado I think they really well I think especially with our most comfortablecan be used by Banks. He is really looks good on the Senate do in the last couple games yeah maybe regardless of the fact that and look at this Tomcat Jonathan Graves is gone around here they're gonna grab some Bee Gees and all right we're plotting stops is there game 5 come they got Hootie his gang Blake in game 5 for this most iconic Champion hardest Carey performance this year had this on this campus trouble gameplay are the one where you lift me up to the next level to the next year I'm excited see if they can actually pull it out it is flying does that really good Synergy with sedge wani as a melee Champion being able to stack up the done with her and that is been the Resurgence that we've seen a lot of jugglers picking stage running back up especiallyevents in melee solo laners becoming too prevalent and so fly crust going for the lantern, that got sent to thrash locked in there going to leave their Top Lane counterpick for later then I got to go to the pick up yet now I have seen a Lucian Yelp quite become a win for him a different word for topped could go through all those you mentioned the grave stele goes away and Gigi go back to comfort and it's real once again interbankAzrael everybody always falls back to the old days he hasn't had the best win rate in the LCS this split with it but this is a player always a highlight seeing him on it and some sort of extra flexibility to play around that topside like I was making a Szechuan beefless Gangplank convos that's why he's actually really good at helping and guarding against possible dive combos if you go with that type of counter option in 2 Gameplay the ones that want to try and dive him early so you don't actually a really good Defense Force that can fly Quest now we're filling in with support band at this point in time, yes please like supposed to be clear but regardless they're going to throw that banned in there she can't play support Morgana is the band I want to see I think it stays with his homework for this path you make sure you're more Donna was up-to-date he is good against threats. But it's fine to walk the routewhen does the threat of the very least and we'll see if that's what's going to be the second band is Jace is off the table it's LeBlanc band away from goldenglue here as the Corky keep being bad as power of evil alright multiple Support options I actually really curious why we haven't seen no Luck's Copperhead up as much you know she is really prominent ever since you got that buff with a slow for the heat before counterpick yeah I think you are more worried about your being taken away by the power of evil cuz I don't think you have to be that afraid of what comes out of the 4th when your work know the entire Lane you again comfortable there and wait for now it's going to be born again strange and poking out his here are some of the best new tools against this year especially even later on in the game trying to check him out so you can't set up 45 for sand filters and everything they still do you do it and since they have grades as jungle if you don't fall into the Trap of your double AP solo laners being kind of a liability grave bury I-80 threat from the bottom side so I like it with the the double cancer fix your from flyquest from coming in at the last second block out some of the unique about a possibility guano play more for the pope but it means I got a very big Frontline on EG side with a very obvious things by big them to stop playing victim to the mid lane big damage on a box length and spent their own ends diesel are on take Duty have some split push pressure pressure for this is back directions to Port not really there either but it's a lot of focus AP kog'maw flash ghost power of evil should be the one empowered to carry this game is a man people looked at all season long for black West at the end of the day I fly out of being very well-rounded with great players and all their length of a step in the right day they can be that big carry the question is now can they do it in game 5 eg1 to Straight black wristbands are shook but can they pulled over again by and I always want to see a peacock mids attacked early with some jungle pressure cuz the early stages of this Champion are our kind of laughable especially if you compared to the later stages of the game for the Certo yeah and everything for him focusing a lot on yo just clearing meaning waves and at least even trying to get him a single item so with with the jungle pressure maybe you can kind of delay that attack power of evil early on and start there yeah can be fun to watch if that can indeed happen I mean it's going to be spicy regardless I honestly did and I love you all kind of counted EG out and think they were tilted or or Garbage but it's like well like Worcester clue the better team this is going to be expected I'm not sure if each you have it in them and they did game for was tight that got to come back they got the really really nice Shockwave out of Golden Buddha set it up that kill on Turtle Snowball the game they killed the Nexus game for was just a tight back and forth the fact they defended a baron buff dragon fight and came away with the team by victory for soul that was impressive that was good stuff that I could they also trusted go to glue things like this, does not work if Grayson doesn't pop off on the LeBlanc we're going to Reliance Health again and the global or in the old going to come through from Grace's attitude that you up and it worked out for them to put the pressure on him and he delivered now he is on your he is one of three very important damage horses on the team we get such Ronnie back in now for sfer Spence go to the front line EGF what's the style of round I don't think I can do it and honestly I think there is a lot of pressure on Houdini because even his greatest critics or okay you're a really good game play video games at your day self him getting that in game 5 it is a dream scenario you do for EG but it also put the extra pressure on him like Okay show it down again you just had a great said game be utility for the team lot of good place setting up for his teammates no taunting bathing people in he seems to prefer it be performing well now this deep into the series but they are going to have to rely on that but from Fike Westside in best-of-five like this will you start to get you know the reverse sweep taking place all the momentum early winds from those tons of people tweeting at all you'll fly Quest higher see they're stopping them obviously it's over Chichi that starts to turn around when when you have lost back to games and you're now facing the reverse sweep there's so much pressure so much tension now for the side of flyquest to pull it out as a third seed as the favored team coming into this alrighty well right now to see the line of scrimmage no longer any cheeky one of the ones Shiki level one that again that is are there invades know there are not defensive Ward recall I'm even the jungle was in the same spot in front of the Red Bluff in Camp can I take my box away we're good to go you know sit down and try brush makes you can I get aggravated okay cool back to the start we go spend staring going to be a blue bow start same for santorin looks like there will be some leash thing in both cases here that's where I'm going to be at for a second late but you can laugh Vine over shouldn't actually be very hurtful there you Autos from bang not very much mayonnaise but not very many Autos wants me to pay for the way from the beginning. Want to give away the early early pressure similar here for solo but he's not going to let him any good little time down there alright let's see if he's going to start on hot side he reports in Turin possibly looking I mean you mentioned that the devil stairs and bottom side for ignorant and wildturtle it's a super defensive line that bang and Stacy were able to draft do you know as a real problem is one of the most difficult to try and make plays on so it would have to be them getting super aggressive for some reason and kind of exposing themselves other than that probably should just be to the power clear here at graves so good at Power clearing and should be able to get the the early CS of Andover State Sewanee at which point you get to start going for those in Bates and with face rest rising to prominence and getting so many bus makes it even easier for Graves to to work around such money that's little play earlier on ignore walk in and take a Brahma cuter than ICS so at least that's a bitter goal tonight from bang Auto comes in twos going to land sold grab total should feel comfortable but not completely cancel that one is they knocked down the minions they grab the cannon no big deal here for BCS so far for the Senate as solos getting attacked by Hootie as you tend to with gameplay footage of the manifold pretty aggressively as much as possible so of course just never liked on the door and she'll do the regen but Reidsville enough nice Barrel, but keeps it going who initially Council up in his Lane Cellars week is very fast but obviously we'll be down so yes here who need canvas kit for more Mana as needed or Houston in that was important to get through that side step cuz that would have been a lot of certain damaged if you'd pulled out grow their I mean people often times Focus so much on GPS call generation and the scaling for the champion but trial by fire the passages so good for him to try and trade on a lot of mail a champion super early on and as you're saying you just get your corrupting potion used trucks are all the charges through your biscuits and try and just continue to spend that out with your grasp also making you tank here I should also mention with this matchup because every time we see it we always have people going what the Gangplank adjust orange out of mordekaiser alt yes that is possibility very favorable interaction that's one of the things that were kind of so good at is saying that you're won't be wanting me you're topping is not doing his team fight power right you're not getting back from Osaka not get additional fees off and now meanwhile santorin stop that as well just being alone the fact that it's like so aggressive there in Torrance on the way let's get out no big deal Barrel vision and he's going to be out for this one who he's I get thumbs up really not a problem buddy don't worry about it I like it by the way. But at least link into that brush if you push it into the turret that's an easy pop Christmas Karen to be to say are you there you are not okay good I can fight between normal yeah is that we've seen him make a note concerning Lane positioning checking stuff like last time we saw him know with the kind of bait where he just walks over looking like he's attempting to Ward to try and I set up the game for his teammates and they're reading the movement of his opponent as super aggressive from solo with low health no reason for him to go for a chase down if Grace is not there even without vision how big is just gone shoes play by ignorance and gold yeah it's our likes to roam around a lot and it gets a huge play for car, this was going to be one of the areas to actually attack for EG early Gamecock muff but my goodness ignore coming to set him up even gives over the last hit what a beautiful support play absolutely massive steps walked over the wall with the lantern as you said on point with the play nowhere for goldenglue to go tonight bring him down as well not since Karen does head up to try and play with Tony again we mentioned you know who he likes Edge Ronnie able to stack up a stunt really quickly without level 6 they don't have the extra stuff so they are going to call it off since he obviously here with no more charges in the corrupting potion completely dry of Mana that is important to farm lead and pretty Campo to go for a Sheen or something else could have easily at least a thousand gold so probably boots on top of it and have the ruin to make those free iwatobi picked up for himself as the Ruby Crystal comes through when you going as fast you can't with Triforce if it helps make sure you stay safe to look at Max the recall who needs to walk to Lane so it was an armed guard his Tepee for this one and Global Advantage for him not to mention the gold he's got + $10 equal in farm right here
what's pectin Canada for Viper and that Camille split just yesterday or I should say on Saturday was the rut that is yesterday it was breach this week have just been on fire even in the first game they played where they lost it off of Baron into recalling in the nevermind. Phoenix is the are the famous Phoenix is Here Is Gone the infamous Twisted Fate going to be left up most likely Lily off the table Ford Artic he is going to play as you brought out and Lilia play it against the clouds look pretty good on it I want to see if those situations arise get again cuz he had a pretty good start will see if you was able to close the rest of that one out now looking at the battle is the rest of the band come throughtruconnex what happened and then oh wait CSM golden Guardian on Saturday or Sunday as their first-round opponent once that comes through Chase off the table good early dominant Champions mcoc top let's see what else they want to protect honestly I love you're looking at CLT over at Big you're probably the most worried about the bottom line for sure. Finaf remove event the standout performer for this team Falls with long but also dark so early on should be a thing you see the Early Middle a band from CLG but you know. Con Graves Star Talk on Fusion Ola for Volver something like that is something I have to keep in mind and didn't ask him again is what also let he will consider the favourite 5 and 7 the record with the door. Phoenix version of this roster CLG for Thrift time they are showing these exact five players on the rip this is the third game on the LCS States Beltre stepped out for two of them for Tuesday he's right back in which I totally agree with the early set pic comes through and frag acidity play that champion last time around they picked it will come true again the highest priority 80 karrie and we'll see if Johnson grass that is his most played Marksman by far to grab that one pic number 8 for Johnson on that yeah and he is just so good that we cannot his as real games hitting pretty much every still shot in these critical teamfight positioning been really good but obviously and I want to see how did play around around the ash rather than having you know the safety of the Ezreal for Johnson there's that Olaf I was talked about for dark. He wants to go in there though it for set up a toys fun having a bastard Wrangler with Hawks. To make it easy and get right back out no problems at all for some laying down as well out of early pressure here I like they're already with beautiful as well to get hot very clearly waiting on support to make sure that later and I'll just be waiting on top link to give Viper carpet and so if you're looking at it now for her for Band-Aids here for Stihl G's probably going to go target support role as the Viper pick up so maybe around as okay as you want to guard against vipers red side last counterpick I don't know if they're worried about anything besides the ribbon that's obviously the big stand out his car was pretty good at going to have to Blind. yeah we can see what's going to come through this one I know he's been a very big proponent of playing Kennen up there and he's not very good cheap flights to the field you have not been really able to convert as LeBlanc and syndra are dropped off the table they are trying to protect Phoenix is Zoe and a good match ups and make that one as safe as possible and leader of the Southland pool up so that they can get a an ocean of options Ford Viper they they split the difference obviously you get your Ribbon band but you also go support take the trash down and obviously going to be first pick support here for dig as they want to save plastic for Pfeiffer forgot it's like Shield definitely goes a long way against against that a lot of times it's just hilarious to be with set prices of someone who can put out in Wayne and that is a combination with an ash very strong pushing for the bottom side you know if you combine your volleys with your with your keys with your silences from Soraka actually like that, though so I can definitely really good overall go to the match up and see how she going to take Camille has not for you we can play Global's as well Twisted Fate is hereby fur throw down against ruined his work showing up Top Lane are we going to get the Renekton into it because this worldwide in the LPL redacted as bad used super effectively get tons of winds but in a lot of the other leagues between attempted Renekton use it at counter picks into stuff like Camille because you can go down and try and have an overpowering Lane put those not turn out and Digger just going to steer clear of that completely and play the support topside game on here for Viper to get on the back of Olaf I love seeing team used solo laners that can accentuate the strength of their junglers off with any sort of extra support on his back really changes the way that you can play that champion later into the game so we might even see him getting a spirit visits and a suraka on theme for Olaf they are really listings are docked up into the spotlight here it's not just going to be the bottom line for dig dog is going to have a lot of power in his hand is early game is going to mean a lot more dig at to see if he can set himself up to be a good vessel for Shen Ultimate Force rocket heels coming through but that should be the focus for this team and a big thing for me is focusing on that offend pick overall because you eat we saw was coming in we just saw the guitar to get the win upset to come through the back half the split Viper with that one and Sylvie says do know we will take the Camille let's do it when Shan comes through the Dodge don't block the Camille queue it blocks the gold kart and if Camille go somewhere else should help them and then gives them the dog do they say fore aphromoo can stay safe because of showing up and I want to see now how much pressure does co2 get topside how much can dig alleviate that and went elsewhere with garlic on the Olaf rag May well be slow to whole bunches already going to be drowsy wait a couple of seconds now look at the rest of the clothes going to punch but bragging is going to lose his life for First Blood and Dick couldn't have asked for a better start to this game does season is on the line in this game a freak and a level 1 kill is a huge blow to morale this is this is a critical tiebreaker getting either franchise into playoffs and that one is definitely going to sting you know why it went over to dardoch that Olaf we've been hyping up a chance feel like we're focusing on God and Sam select are Doc is going to have the extra long sword coming into it oh my goodness that bubble from Phoenix straight across the long wall they got fish in a frog has as soon as he fell asleep he knew he was doomed yep he didn't use any summer cells after that and the Talisman for the more healing and and he's here but he but it is a faster clear I like longsword if I get first blood on me like that because you get more PVP damage and trying to invade and look for fights but he is gone for the classroom faster PVE clear and said the case for him Miss we watch through I believe I want to kind of recollect about that that level one I don't believe fracas ever showed out of like a Voorhees about the whole time so I really nice land level 140 Chief had done so many times to great success in their history of the organization was really really clever level one that got them in early lead to burn to flash without him to kill or something else really powerful this case of children receiving end off a really nice that play getting over you started with the Sleepy trouble. Make that would happen if they spot fracas on three camps gun into blue buff they know it's the cancer gone be the fact of October they do he is topside and the only Camp they can post they wanted was the crugs to see if they have a cigar Don most annoying 80 carry in the game for junglers it's not something that you have a hard time killing it's the Hawks. It's the ass just because of all those early reviews and write off of that jar dock by process of elimination easily able to move over to drugs and counter jumbo carrots and he can take the bottom crab as well just supporting us a Ciroc Elaine that we were talking about getting that harassment down continually pushing in on sticks and do they have been pretty low here to look for their looks damaged right now can it be enough smoothie is a parking right now gets poked out a little bit with the fact that he took drugs down there that's actually pretty easy to infer and co-chief having to sit there and play defensively acting a little bit low I'll take bottom Scuttle enjoy the extra couple hundred Health damage I did but you're not play that you want to from now on and it allows Johnson and aphromoo an easy reset because they have to constantly worry about to collapse. Taking them they're not taking the back here for Johnson and Akron was actually cancel and they stick around just going to continue to pressure with the extra Ward hurt a lot of water has the flash early and does not take any more damage the chickens will at least for the fractions the result that. I've never spotted here and look at the equal camps on both sides equal item in the most cases well she saved it to level one who's the sunglasses this time of that froze froze up Phoenix burns his flash go over the wall and want to get into this one getting lower and lower needs to push out of his own jungle mad so annoying trying to get away from Zoe have Phoenix's pictures of blacks that follows it and practice they're going to give up all the pressure 6A by himself Down Under the tower Target jumps around not going to sound but we'll go down. Claims he killed credit cards burned by pobelter mean he is not in mid will lose without farm and now stick table TV back he was here and we're just seeing more of the killer week 9. The first two games they really Came Out Swinging they're not changing the pace up here at all completely offensive mindset star. Getting the first blood off of the level one then pushing it a head that use hot shot scouting out fraga's will time invade here on the bottom side forcing more Summoners forcing extra kills and even diving down there to try and further set behind that is really easy to use a Teleport back he just has the tear so do after attack damage down here just throwing out in the sticks. Trying to stack up and farm away right now and blind text Elaine Piper picked a bit more reason for the lane but a 15 csb as ruined completed for 3 called Elaine sheet is in he's got a fuel pump be by the matches going to play out and the pyramid heads up two on two or three one-on-one I should say. The lead so far against Viper but didn't off as a team the rap about a thousand gold off of Jungle difference in off of Bot difference in Turlock with all of the money is going to be the one that snowball in the early oceans 8 yep going to keep stacking this one shed is now level six so as you're looking at the CVS up there vipers looking at San United teleports are available for both of the top laner so it still could be an answer for ruin and until you know if I / can't either interrupted or tries to force it out with no top side pressure with Doctor something you could be an answer for ruin just a little bit more of a delay on that one the arrival of your Stand United regardless no reason for Johnson and a promotion stop pushing or they keep up the pressure on the bottom side keep biting those objectives vipers Lane in an awkward spot right now stuck in front of ruins turret with zero of vision at all CLG have a control we're topside and there was nothing that Viper knows he has no idea if ragged like you showing off or pulled out to my old up there and with testicles made him you are just dead so he is bleeding farm right now it is still afraid he's going to get far behind router with first level seven and Navy Seals you can find their went through top because they are down a thousand gold elsewhere so you actually need for range minions if it's right in front of your trip to keep it there indefinitely to I believe there were only three of their goal jugglers are heading up to the top side though as almost all by themselves lights to help get the first one down but overall just be a Smash down here in the bottom side pain CSD the only obvious this really rich off the kills you know that he's 40 gold or so the fact of course he had the really limp around through the Olaf has he heard a little bit afro also I like going for the more aggressive the arch degree tear support item and going selfies of the few bus play some aggressive me to get the same golden come a truck to the two of you does that that's what the fish do we need some degree to get those items online as fast as possible darlock now still finding it Mutual objectives to kill he's not up in Camp count really but it I'm too good Gangsta poke one could take off first blood and a lot of big neutral he's got the First Rate he's not going for the hair and it looks like I can test your practices in the area Twisted Fate ultimate is available for pobelter
step by questor utilizing an app for a lot hit utility has been absolutely great and this one flyquest are getting playing in the first round of plastic question is which team will they face if they lose face it here at 4th Street facing if they win they take her spot away from TSM just like Teen Titans record they are 2 hours ahead they will take their adult face Evil Geniuses as their first-round The Immortal side a win means they tie dignitas and CLG and we will tie break for the eighth and final seed into playoffs even when they are alone and 10th and their season is done we'll see you in 20 21all right everything on the line here I like the band from Versailles honestly the set has highest priorities King in setting up on any teams plus they showed already in our highlight reel santorin flexing that pic to Jungle as well so give them a lot of Versatility out with that one off the board just go over to your farm and carry oriented jungler for Santorum for himself maybe he'll be taking the spotlight more in this game the thing with black was still in the way that they build their team's not power of evil on things like galio they almost always have tired of people on very good scaling I damage a p threat from the mid lane took control Mages really quick as Aunt from Mortal self they are going with the jungle in Vaiden Twisted Fate even with the wild-card Nerf going to go try and push in Rome for insanitycast game of split in the LCS for insanity and it's the first day as well if my dad's don't lie to me so look here when it matters most to get back against the wall you can not make playoffs if you lose this and you got a punch up against the top 40 on which beIN game yesterday he said look it's roughly desk app and ETSU Auto pretty much at all and it's got you two look good on a snap line and the Damage output is it too bad we'll see what the other goes for in this one you know it's the forces against TF wouldn't be surprised if he cleanse to drive to the gates out there we'll see what comes through at the end of the day it appears all Band Away anyway so is the number of Target so you're going after it with Target yeah it is it is good you get those Autos in but obviously it would be extinctTarget damage that's going to be adding support targets the worst that build gets I do like Immortals though like to your point of them stepping outside their comfort zone you're probably not going to beat black with a tank top with scaling AP mid like in Sandy had play you know he played a peacock MacArthur's Wiley's Farm up eye damage you know AP teams and and to set that up music by 500 CE just don't see you beating flyquest at that took some of the best attitude in that type of sleep. So yeah I like it they're going for a Smithy on did Elise see what he can do vs. Graves generally when Natalie and Graves meet each other in the jungle stare down contest unless there's some later than her acting just going to go your separate ways and and focus on the phone answer of course we're neither bot laners grab in the first phase of the Vixen dance that's the case right here so income the flag Quest band saying well okay the 80 karrie like a b t r pools with a wide tie to play whatever buthey what's good to thresh aggressive Batman is there on the hillside Theater Berkeley strong and should be played at Apollo has been one to pick up made it very quickly but have no physical damage you know that's the kind of stuff I mean to do that point specifically the little Karthik nurse didn't come into effect until 10:16 or so long 10:15 so yeah you're only problem is getting your big a deep threat but those types of venturing out into unexpected fix definitely can be rewarded in situations like this just for Apollo to bring his 80s and it's kind of weird too because you're thinking of in Sandy's champion pool and you like okay well he's pretty much only going to play a tank in the topside paint or like a bruise or like or got ityeah never really going to be one of those big split play shirt so if you're doing Twisted Fate it's more about like taking towards bottom side and getting bottom side of head rather than a lot of the other options that you see you later to the game with with Twisted Fate style and now I'm super curious with their saving last pic to support for hakuho yeah it does something part of gates really the only way to the store now I will say this does feel less like directly trying to save it and out of your find it anyway but it's like well we got to get or before it's banned if we got to get over before it's been tested by while fertile it's ended up tacos going last after or if he's going to go really well we're going to have to go charge my sanity fighting after its antifa people rely an alarm that should be enough we hope but I don't know what's going to go I mean I would even Monica's Ira put the minute or something but he's not going to eat that really brought out of that it's going to beyou can block to the hurricane both second field decent you can stop the ball from going to be for down like there's some interplay here but really Apollo going to be safe on the back line but there's nothing to decide to keep it again and everything on Apollo here like that that has to be the way that they win this game I'm very curious to see how the how the early stages go with with the Smithy on the Natalie typically has been a lot safer he is one of the lowest and counter jungling percentage has one of the lowest in 4% and all these are metrics of time that you spend in the opponent's side of the map and your phone is jungle take away their camps taking it you're creating pressure and getting division in Italy that is something that is greatly rewarded especially if you have a Twisted Fate on your team and one of the ways that combo is usually used is the in bed with Natalie trying to find them at a camp land of spirits with the Fey ultimate and or even set it up with a gold card but it isdon't pull off those plays then like they really got a fake on Apollo Caring Heart with Ezreal on his mid-game power Spike all right well we are in a regular season game of flight next weekend in the best-of-five because either golden guardian or Evil Geniuses if they win this one on the Immortals side if they lose their out if they win they have a tiebreaker got an invasion of the bottom side that's going to be a lantern learned early on he made safe for the wise though they're going to stay alive at least the attempt to make it more difficult for wildturtle to click he still gets the click off already plays it does for us about to go to add eggnog you really do tend to want sleigh and hooked if you can help it for the Lenny face because you can sometimes find yourself a Christian too aggressive there and the day though it's not the worst thing in the worldwith what is losing to their trinkets texted going to make a gangsta easier for santoor than it already is First Blood over half his games and now there's too much work to do it yep and it is going to be a lot on all. Good experience here with towards the bottom Lane given over to Turbo an experience as well and a little bit shared sense the sweeper was purchased by egnor all right results 20 each has now been torture to go for his least let's start topside it is kind of slow or that way around but at the end of the day it's not going to be a problem with the very easy and very safe to take down these camps solo pushed in early husband apple cider top winter just take it up to the front line you've got a filia story out of the back line not going to be a problem there for you with all really push goes Taco in Apollo either of course and level teeth come in all right so pay attention to bottom line routes from Santorum as well on graves clearing top to bottom and set up for attacking probably the biggest area that I have Mortals need to win India's Rio Bravo if you could try to stay as late as rules mid-game Spike that is just so big so you can try and set that as real behind and you kind of messed up is forcing an early teleport uses no forcing something where he doesn't get his new tier recalling is is kind of app that can be really big has the biggest strength of Israel is obviously when do you get your remind transformation in here and everything starting to come together at the right time and that will assist want him to farm effectively does it feels like a Triforce came through as well for even more damage in the mid game I feel like I said I'm going to go for here or the other Perfect Image let you know it gives more Mana you just nowhere close on a d even with the other hermana conversion it's from the red gun so you could even come through Rockwell shuts down there do I get to finish up that crap and pop the Bloom as well both Douglas already know and you assumed they they did the exact same routes trading top and bottom of crab in Italy meet up unless there's something like Lane interference with equipment lane or accused Rush Advantage where you get to throw out of line spear something like that it's it's not going to have a commitment and both of them are kind of just racing on power clearing and playing around the strength of their Lane in front of his house or just mentioning the gold of course really close to the game nothing is too absurd as happened very early on Xfinity keeping up with sand for that lie against Graves nothing is really kept them do what they want to do so farther even on the same camps right now with the cops are going down across the map and nothing to be concerned about just get into this one is like wasn't going to waiting around for more to do nice Brian hook for big. Wait to see when the first recalls do come through for a guy to make a Realms app and he's so good at getting around the mountains affect the other lanes damage for the turtle back nicely done there is. Late again is great slightly pushing I think I question if it's happening with the case right now so out of metal or shouldn't be any kill precious yet you can't little after damage so low I believe you talked to biscuit just to be safe but he's going to take the weekend alright so first reset for him on top side with c o u actually sticks around because of the risk you're talking about him chugging and bottom side will be the focus was sent to begin damaged lacrosse yeah okay no big deal. I was only health potions until we have more mad with the biscuits of my badges do the one quite correctly or who knows I'm done wrong it was on after all but regardless I think he's trying to find something better recall get the full Catalyst of the TV that's what you was waiting on you to the Catalyst in Lexington fillable Order channel. Spell regardless so listen to I can stop by there it is time to go buy it D be there you go waiting for the ambient gold perfect easy BS word for wild turtle back to shove into Canada wave I believe but with the not any slower than waiting for a different way so that's just fine save the coupons I can make it happen now its way towards Med and then I'm going to be forced to Flashlight really really nice stuff right nothing else to do it and apply for the 10 days that was a nice attempt then they do facts about to head up thank you sign up I am bored as though even though blacklisted a very good job turning into flashes on the bottom quadrant of the map because of the reset and portals get to take away the objective on the bottom half of the map first before flyquest can capitalize on burning those Summoner spells. Aqua even with his flag flown sommerfeld books which is right over now he's super defensive exhaust heal and even though they blow in settings Flash in Midland with the with the dragon God that's where I'm just kind of fishing around for more camps and it does get a silk wrap for himself but doesn't want to push his luck as always he does want to put this like as far as the kind of drink and drive back to the spawning Raptors as well because this is the also what you get out of a Teleport is a poly was able to instead of recalling what role did I walk to drink with Hillary calls and then just TP to get back to Lane in time to not lose any fun otherwise Apollo s Celtic to the great goes down sometimes that to just be not worth it right you're missing 200xp and 120 gold and exactly on your first by you usually head into something like this that is a power fit of a power trough Where You're vulnerable to gay guy stuff rocks play in from ignorance Jaco cannot be the Target in from Twisted Fate easy kill this is what I was supposed to pay it around the back of the blame for it and did not just around the map but Autumn Lane for sure they want as much possible Focus here for Apollo as they can for the says little for big big game Power Spike to try and carry the team he does give up most of it to replace a power people should be able to finish that one off so one turret plate for the first Bud play but really well set up by Immortals taco and once again he keeps on trying to go get brushed it off and Landing shoes on to Turtle he does get the Stray one there so as soon as I land Apollo doesn't hesitate pops right over the minions it would have dropped it there and even though it dies chasing really well X Twisted Fate ultimate another
simple treats in seven games has been unique Champion AJ has in 17 these are of course two incredibly strong right now and TSM are fighting for a playoff bye with Cloud 9 win just lapped up as those people that fight for the last playoff by Team Liquid have already locked first on face Stellar second-half the split right back you'll 14 liquid right now for this team because DSM I've done a lot of experimenting and testing different Champions especially Purex pain while you're trying to adapt very quickly and they have a lot of a lot in their Arsenal for Champion Select 14 liquid since they're already locked first place I don't think they are the ones that need to show anything that they maywant to stay before playoffs so to me champ select he's even going to continue the analogy that the test was talking about where Team Liquid just want to stay sturdy stay strong and show what they've already sound previously in the split not getting anything away and trying to feed TSM that way where is TSM might be more willing especially on red side to reach further into those variations of champion that they have shown already in this with try and come up with a win here forthwith high with Cloud 9 and get themselves at 5 already tactical forgot to go on Ashlan and I have to take this means a lot but is there the new Patrick laughter just 10.16 it has pull up here and nurse things like this like a shake-up at 10:16 I think like thatif your c336 you're going to eventually pay steam liquid but you have to show up after 5 to show what your draft parody is what your playstyle is on 1060 n t l could watch shouldn't they are we don't think you have a good handle will tell you first round that thinks or a second router that feels really good for us that luxury of getting to watch Cloudy and the extra point is a really really really good 90th and Flagler they can all be each other it's not like to make sure that you're ready to go against your like the opponents here and so must win to have a chance at that play at 5 by time rain cloud 9 now going back to the game itself btsm Atmore Dr rezai Rec on locked into face after the bottom Lane against Bush that's all the reasons I'm so excited I've been looking forward to this game all week longI do think that this is going to be a Guess m answer of jungle here so you don't have to show your mid laners or your top cleaner yet there you go you just get the jungle answers speaker has had some of the best games honestly on Glisan even though a lot of people are critical at the scaling for lease in in the plays that you have to pull up later you already are showing tonight work on with rutan's play making Gleason and rakan are the most mobile Champs in the game and allow you for a lot of mid-game jungle support plays trying to set up the rest of your wieners so now they can focus their band on the on the topside or I would honestly even try and protect middle little bit since the attempt of the ones they're going to have to pick first and and blind one of their Lanesyeah and as the kind of end of what has come into you have done a better job of being able to carry through Broken Blade he's been having better gain to be dropped from a little bit more on red sign be so often sees how it feels like blind man is often able to nullify and go close enough Champions like Oriana can work out pretty well soon as you can see the blind it's okay like a peacock. So yeah we'll see if they will play to go to the way around impact very likely to play a safe tank tops tight end and that's also the reason why I can look it up and away safe for Mid laners blind mid laners if you're too had an amazing would walk game with the Yumi attached to him make a very good case for his MVP status so I expect another band at a blind Apple mid laner like you kind of went over you know either the Oriana or the Zoe to pretty good options for piercing it ends up being the galley elephant Woodrownot have the global to deal with the team play and that doesn't leave open the shame you're talking about for impact but I very much doubt that steam liquid watching blind pick the shed and assuming here and pick them up later for Purex scent and save their counter pick for broken played who has been so willing to take Hill Lane in the top side and it was going to be Zoe does come through you mention to say if blind. Give me the pick up we'll see what Tia wants to do for themselves even though Shanda's you know I mean really every time the game has counter picks I still think that has one of the safe ones to go for overall of course he then tells a jungle top the guanica the control over what are TL going for who is the answer to do in the middle and who's going top Oriana not a surprise to your dressing back on control MagesNano case endurance Edge through all that makes sense if ever you want to go forth and now what's going to pop in for impact our way more than okay yeah you know whichever control Mage I don't really care but we're to get Sam Sentra is a really good counter to work on upwork on and gauges and 100% of the Euro heater orkon or often times we send to Hatfield offensively so if they stick Jensen here with this injury duty if they're able to get him through the early game without getting a lot of interference from the record from the least you get to the point at Sindra where you can easily one combo either of those engaged choices for TSM your scan of the week is just so good vs work on it requires very good timing and very good you know vision and scouting but that is what we're going to get the scent does indeed come in no surprise there for enact on the topand broken play dancers with the plank to me the champion is tuition and fee Reddit Lee but I have been very critical of Broken Blade specific Gangplank play I feel it a lot of criticism from other pro top laners about his ability to actually carry later on into the stages of the game with gameplay can put out as much damage as other Gangplank players so I'm going to keep my eye on him see you when I can do this game if he can prove them wrong so far this split on his feeding carried a performance forward to use him against fighting for a playoff bye with a win there a tiebreak cloud 9 at the end of the day with a lost they sit and wait and they can fall 2/4 is flyquest beat of Mortals their fate is out of their hands DSM between 2 and 4 to be decided up just this in the next game that is what they do keep in mind for splatfest ketchup to anymore scene and we got that win but that was in the running earlyrunning today and that's going to be the other Stakes for the future game so he isn't fighting without spot see all this point it is tuna we know they are getting first seed we know this kid is on a pack of their specific spot in the standing in the first round of playoffs either because they have the buy they're going to wait and watch for who the better teams are in the other bracket regardless but how good can see I looked in their last game on his pack their last game go to the season the best burger TL as an orchid ever gotten in the LCS and after a catastrophic leave bad spring split turn it around with tactical joining the roster Brock's it being here full time so I guess we care Taco Plainfield tiny play the few games last split the head coach TL have turned a bad thing to put around back to their winning form of 2018 and 2019 yeah I mean it is a tune-up game for give me a quick but also and I think even more so it is a grudge match here doublelift did not leave Team Liquid on the best of terms despite bowside saying oh yeah your Mutual we both decide this is probably better for both and it's not just one side of the bottom Lane that has been traded here this is a very incestuous bodyblade Optical used to laid with treats on TSM Academy as well so both support Blair's trading both 80 karrie Partners over to the other side and both of them looking to prove that they are the better bottom Lane. There is so much ego in this bottom of a matchup for both sides both of them have been very active on social media even though they are friendly about it and on cordial terms I love to see matches with extra space Stakes attached to them as far as the trash-talking goes another 120 19th bring together and now they're doing battle here to the one I do want to get credit I know one meme we get from the internet as the fight back and forth actually could fly Corps did they even a great job down theredepression machine going to pick up players they don't last very long to go to the for elite treats girls at the first really sort of homegrown TSM Talent where he played on a cabin for them for over two years. Fraud up but he's actually really good part of the teeth of a surgeon has been preached coming back in on the roster you know replacing biofrost and he's got like one Death Star like he's going to really really really well for the squad as part of the second-place definitely true he has that died in the last 5 so we'll see if Team Liquid can deliver him his a first-person quite a while on the top side Broken Blade starting out doing really well with the pink match up to charge up your grasp on the minions very easily and just keep on shooting them said of course worth mentioning that he did get the extra 20 hp added to the shield passive and he's trying to spend that it helps you out a little bit in this matchup as you can see you still take a BeatI'm Broken Blade not hesitating to continue to product grass been burning all of his man up for that harassment and pushing the wave of that match up by the way is the energy burst Mana pool where fireworks Midland cuz it should be fine until a piercing slowed makes a lot easier glp drowsy if you don't want to take the running man in front of fan fuse on Chene and shouldn't really wants to get you know it's as much longer Shield cooldown up for each of those bar lights and playing around that could be important impact walking but he can't broken manifold decent as he recalled that's why the strategy for the slam for the game playing is to push the way while you're doing it so basically she could spend all your mad at you go super heavy harassed you shoot them on cooldown fucking every grass that you can every 4 seconds harass him as hard as you can and push the wave and then you recall and you refill your corrupting potion that's exactly what broken plate did he's been playing the beginning of this match up really wellroxa taking Crux is able to get a trial by fire from the executed here but broken but you see through all of his breath in potion charges for the extra man of harassing pushing the wave and then once you push the wave like that you get your recall off the refill it and buying a call now if you continue trying to farm to farm and you ran out scale this mess for later impact costly better at time of the auto attack probably in the air so gets the barrel. Down each time well done to him tactfully got the mechanics still on so many years after his world championship victory in 2013 he still got it as we all know he's one of the very best players in this league one of the best top laners and definitely Mainstay on the TL side one of the trophies whose name of course he isn't getting the shove down to the bottom side Warhammer for deadlift if I have my gold estimations correct treats can easily block the hook and that's really nice back to the time just tight enough that they get to go back anywayare the top five to looks like broken blood was unable to pick up the all of those CS it's a really good NCS leave for himself with a couple of extra being traded now but really nicely done for the last didn't you mention the fact that can practice getting off timing the better on the barrel but also his last hitting has been better during a trade and broke a plate at lost a few in his aggressive push that he tried to pull up since you're packed is going no obviously with the grass with Missy only Top Lane Keystone if you're ever going to take the champion on you got a lot of the extra sustained in the tree he is coming out of it with the extra cold now what they want to point out is at least as far as he was concerned Jen wins more games today in the match of heads up more successful over the course of a game of League of Legends Lane but could mean that you know has overall more impact right now and you sing with with the shantywith the dogs and also blocking parlays I got a decent of tools to to deal with the annoyance of direct shot parlay are some of the damage output there and you saw some pieces of it as he keep his back to lay me in and now we can play right now on there wasn't any set up their range 4432 so but not a huge cost that he was probably going to teleport right back to Lane treats a little bit bar out in the river but he has plenty of Mobility on the championthey shot their buy beer something to get something for the chance of going to fight over towards death and will still kill it he's still flying over there small CS leave here on the Sims Road North York and add to slime thick is Champion let's see liquid now to the counselor on the bottom side with that push coming through capsule on the earliest a lot of power to act was really move to be focused and finish out the way you can come back around the written test for this one now speaker is he or swiping to come through as well he'll chemistry to court JJ Team Liquid into the bed of the first battle this game they want to use
because if they get back to form their went to the best team in North America and and that's the question is does cloud nine ever come back to becoming Cinderella if I could ever go back to that night and no teeth at Spring split team if they show up again better watch yourselves North America take your heads but if not if they stay at this level you know yeah it's like they can fall as far as 4th I believe for their seating in the postseason they nearly tossed but not even be in playoffs replacing seal to hear this to be another really close game and and I mean it's going to take your confidence and you've got about six days to turn things around be ready to go as soon I don't get that first round bye they have a 5 days going to run before the first round last in some cases pending on on which day to apply on stuff will see you soon I can do it again or better than TSM to get that second seed over all those teams are tied at 12 and 5 and TSM please Team Liquid later they would be a tough one will see what happenedmake all the sense in the world C. W with that pic and I really do like the red side Caitlin banned from teams not allowing birthday Caitlin to go over anymore cuz it's it's such an easy strategy to try and utilize where you have Caitlin flood you know some long-range support duties that could be one way to allow the other teams can get the hours for Caitlin and immediately pick up the first round of the listed here on the side of Cloud 9 on Boeing that with a very aggressive jungler in grave clobber has not had Graves game from he had not also had to delete games either previously and champions for the early game Power farming and with glad I'm now sitting there for Autumn side up with one of those vents Des Champions one of the Champions do we associate him with even from his origin days at the very beginning of his careerbefore he even changed his name Calista has been one of his most outstanding pics and that could be a lot of bottom side play making for them on the side of see OG though they're just walking in on Tuesday another comfortable control May cheer for the mid lane and the scaling side of it with the ability of sand bottom is very very interesting has fallen angels to Fair bit still decent win rate in Pro Play Still seen occasionally but I was he with the nurse no longer that top prize on The C9 side seriously missing from lavish camping for I thought it fit the scene on Spotify. I thought it was a player I'm going to be picking it up here also I'm happy to see C9 playing for early aggression to get the early games know about going into trying to Crush the game in 25 I think C9 I think they're going to try to return the form by holding in a style I think it's something like that and I want to see what else they pick around it and discpick their Champions close the top unlikely so possible on a boulder is play top link but now we are the second Tuesday exactly they don't want to get killed pressure for jet ski go back to their style of Rome style Champions you know it's things like Echo things like Twisted Fate even where he can support this aggressive bottom line Focus that they've got a raise already locked in that could very easily be them trying to play around that bottom side back up dragons early as a win condition of trying to get to that stole meanwhile we have seen the return of players practicing a call he's ever since it was played by the closer with a z in the lck SKT for for Faker so I I knowit hasn't been played how much on the rift and we decided yesterday with Jensen for Team Liquid but I know for a fact that a lot of the Soul winners have been putting timing it on it in practice with that band out this key back on his Zoe it's it's not the Super aggressive mid lane Champions but quite good at roaming with the extra W speed and safety that you can get from picking up Summoner and provide you a lot of potential to set up and supplement Graves invades I want to be Aleister Alistair as the last pick you up or scale to see it a lot but he got buffed if you have to go he's actually very good in toothbrush overall it is an absurd amount of Frontline it is a lot of meatballs and it's there for orianna NFL pixelated and if there is a key that works here it is a bunch of bad damage on the 9th with Lane that if you can survive and scaletake the team fights to see if there is a way out on the way in I like this traffic and do it Cloud 9 for this before a licorice but I think this is smart as well and things like will have a field day from get to a Checkers 1st and set up at them so they can try and force Cloud 9 to funnel to them through small areas and you can get off all of your AOE bottom line Focus freaked it is out of control on topside ultimate down bottom start out 1 2 3 going for 9 they should be forcing plays around that side of the map even with the Alistar pick I think it is it is definitely the area of focus for that so I wanted to keep very closeattention to blauers first game on graves how he's going to pass early now focused on at bottom side Scuttle crab to start that out with the early vision and even try and get some deep rewards on to the enemy camps because CLG if you mess around and you give this comp over some money that isn't insane AOE Wombo Combo Bourne ultimate Alistar ball Delivery Systems it's definitely has possibilities here at Fort CLG sealed be drafting is very heavy team fight and I cannot fault in Fort again I like this draft a lot a lot of the magic look good they tried to protect the Oriana feel safe is he goes down to Zoe which should be handleable and now CLG on the map looking for some early information to know what kind of Pop Labyrinth is taking on the Cloud 9 side been going to be over team fight focused Keystone lethal Tempo and hail of blades are by far the most common on Calista Hale really good for crushing Tulane to get three out of the pastso a bit of a lake in Fairly standard things on his side all right now as far as my desire for a level one invited we did at least have the recall for bladder to switch over to a sweeper so maybe they can go for a delayed invade sweep as they're going in they might find something maybe so many bladder is leading the way looking to spot out where a board might be always exciting to go toward kill with your Mater top winter nearby about the damage talking to be too much maybe get 625 Mana for manastone is exactly what I want to see with the graves pick the delayed invade you switched over to the sweeper it gives it away they seal the way the Red Bluff a lot of people when they see Graves they think oh it's the Marksman jungler you've got a scale of your farm oriented you should be played very aggressively in the early stages trying to use your range advantage to form a lot of enemy camps rather than your own is going to be a few laid single start gear for Progress they did have the ward on the Red Bluff over and with the movement there from Tuesday he cited out the invade flapper going to try and head straight red to red. Volibear on the way out split sleeper volibear though Top Lane pushing and maybe they kept a little scent of him here. Just going to be an extra Fort Bragg us as well as a unit bottom 1459 helping out a little bit with ladder just taking a look at how that whole thing kind of started out because it was really interesting it's like okay I know it looks like a jungle pathing plays out I got to get to read ASAP to get that for gets stolen and then well I'm crazy but that's clear I can take to camp and then secure my own top jungle it'll be fine I'll be there before the others it's a Viber gets a full actual Camp lead every jugular wants chicken need to get to is easy to kill or drop it was going to be left up anyway that's not really much of a seal in fact that we spawn higher-level with some like chickens that you actually get that as as gold difference yeah early on they don't like it as much until you get like your body center for the Haley explosion and then Yuri on top of it and you just love it and just blows up the camp butts grave could do any camping the entire game and take almost no no damage. So he's happy to get that away lover also left behind a couple of small ones so you to your concert shuffling Point fully delays the respond of that camp so it won't return at a higher level and practice with machete start of course looking for more action rather than a farming so liquor is going to be the or just come in though and I got a flash the way licorice survive the to be one dive getting a flash of the ruin the process and a good job holding on to his W there there's not a amended amount of surprise vs. damage that can come out from a volibear orange both of them being level four and three so licorice seats saved his guilt of a last-second fill he's very low value out of it they cannot take Lipitor at any longer and Flash blown by Seals be in the attempt to dive and licorice comes out of it unscathed alrighty comes out OKC LG audio 800 gold leader Leon did Layne is getting flat spot Lane getting clapped a fair bit as well with the far left to grab this won't be a full 13 PSD in actuality BBC yes a v a hundred fifty gold difference in mid as recess come through for both sides just getting out lane straight up we knew his ladies that's where we can Academy still came through with the wind sell more of a mid-game can you buy flyer but sealed he already has problems the early game than not getting any better just yet it's a gold leaves tips if it's fraud yeah and Oriana picked a lot for our leader game utility as well liquor is filled up with double waves here but there is no present from lab or anything to come for a dive or press him off so it should be able to pick up most of it and actually pull ahead of his BS benefiting from the Christmas in quite a quite a few on the dive and ensuing teleport back a lot of things already coming out to the dragon though for champ select are they said that should be the clearer Focus from 59 callista to just believe that bottom side then and Vulcan for some riding to the power they reset for is there a recall for the first items first time you get your boot upgrade here for it's been so you get your. Speed and then they can easily take the dragon with a Beretta very quick Pace that's what they want to do get their soul as quickly as possible by a bladder already has a full ten camps done counting the Drake there's the flash tops liquor still have to go to the charge doesn't pack have to do that afraid of Flash's long-term put something you can't be twice and honestly by one we take those are the Lakers playing the the weak-side really well I guess if he's going to come make it a strong side just fans going to attack is exhausted not quite asleep at his place is nice try buddy you put up the camp top play let me show you the top link gate goes and misky get that team first what do you have to roaming this to you once again strikes while we're going to make sure Tuesday doesn't get a cancer play moving down towards the bottom side and see if I can do anything about the actual counters don't going Tuesday does have open available another look at the top winners by the way have at least like three or four of their remotes to set as the camping remote that is at once again swing-and-a-miss licorice just eats the orange trades flash for flashing deck and then you see at the meeting up right here? Makes up the river so that is sealed case and whiskey could be roaming up and yes they still have sprockets clearing the control word in the river this is one of the most common I like to write I really felt the the excitement with that one too yeah I can play on topside I just want to dive into it even more cuz that is something I see in a lot of solo queue games to with junglers that will go for their game and after they get something off their gank they're not really thinking about the rest of their opponents and very clearly CLG and pain progress were just Meandering down there killing off the canal ward in the brush with the? Teams also going down to the communication either not strong enough for like hey get your ass out of there or the timing was just off because I call you know so we just left either way Cloud 9 have kind of stepped back up to the type of way that we saw from them when they were at their most dominant it is aggressive fiber playing off bottom line pressure and then Misty also running around HealthSouth licorice we playing the weak-side quite effectively in a game by a whole lot they don't have a slight 15 minutes that got it in half the time right now I'm curious what the next 7 look like over the wall Fulton baby seals with the guy had flash I accept the auto tag coming in Gold come to the Cloud 9 and 2 it's about to be attacked yeah you like that is my kill you're welcome for the room
great I was wondering how your long I was going to have to wait till you see if they like that it to our patch 11.2 gamesir for the LCS all of the team agreed they wanted to be up to date on the current past didn't want no lag behind at all but not a lot of dental changes to ProMedica we expect a pretty big differences so far Olaf and Thalia are both open and knocked her and has taken the place so already there must have been some scrimps stuff going on Nocturne got really really good Bots bo4 jungle and Priscilla Lanes reducing the cool down significantly on the Q definitely helps a lot but those rolls are we going to get the oil off here or the Thalia we get neither so they wanted they want to don't want to give up or just one power jungler call Nine West to take you know whatever is left after that assuming a lot of is bics you know they're probablyAP response here and FBI against E-liquid back in the regular season very aggressively and Hulu with an 80 carry off of something like a it's a lot of Lulu is a possibility as well who I am partial to bot Lane also a really big interaction here whenever you see Olaf and Kindred Lulu pick on the other side this already touch with these are dipping their toes into hard engage and dive with an Olaf play style and you have lots of counter and Gates year on cloud nine defensive Kindred ultimate Lulu Shields this team already looks like they want to cut back like they want to have some Zone control more things you can layer on top of that you can have Galileo you can have Swain you can have both picked up and those are good options to a hundred thieves take a couple of the tools they expecting Cloud 9 to go for is always the possibility of anti Synergy grackle to run out as gay their lands and you get no Knockouts but yeah they both work really well against Telegraph zones like with the ultimate either you cast them out of the inborn ability or you guys land right at the end and Sofrito by Victory so will be fun to watch what kind of these can do with their heart and Gage orellana going to the answer again another display Champion Self you can help kick you out of your own can adult there as well or keep people alive as you've now got three supported fix for whoever's down there already is a big departure from what we saw from cloud nine for the entirety of locking tournament so far it was Cloud Nine all three early takes looking for things like hack for looking for all these dive composition we're going to do for aggressive already as you're saying lots of supportive looks for them lots of kite back so to put a lot of weight on to spread and we get to Hype up even more the bottle a batch of here between hundred thieves and Cloud 9 a lot of talk going around who is the best in the league who is going to go vs. Team Liquid nail for that for that crowd this game is going to is going to really determine a lot of that so let's see how Santa got some no change in the way that you can actually have practice player props on your queue now so I try to take that one off the table these are definitely some some small changes that were at least seeing already in the big dance the son of band makes me think Samira is pretty likely Senate is I would say the single best couch pic into Samira all of her abilities that matter or base getting you into the woods Auto q u e u ignore the W it doesn't matter at all you out range by absurd amount is that a lot of gameplay left so that was one of the options again that is the most standard late-game hard carry special with caixa is gone so is it going to be raining it's you know possible that support Foster Grant Gustin still talk like we don't know just yet but Misfortune is an aggressive later and I'm curious seraphine is all set are tripling down on their hard engage year of philius picked up at the perfect 80 Kari when you expect your opponent to be charging you with a bunch of mail a freak see him trying to cycle through get those truck rims going and you're going to have plenty of Shield to work with you have a kindred Cloud 9 taking a more supportive defensive kite back look that we've seen all tournament long for them showing some flexibility here already a game number one of his best of 5 we knew that these teams had had more flavors I'm glad that they're wasting no time getting straight to it has meanwhile they have plenty of tools to steal Triforce this through especially early on so it's going to come. You looking at these level once when you have Olaf versus Kendra there's a lot of potential for level 1 invade here especially on the side of a hundred thieves I think they would benefit greatly from trying to get a deep board and even possibly trying to split that map yeah we going to see if the map does come through I'm just thinking about the team comps energy still where I was a little surprised to see you're welcome through overall I thought there were other being a really adopted out there but if he does dive in of course you can vacuum everyone in but the ultimate didn't help keep them all in the same play for in the Galleon smash is down and out what else goes on the Concorde Misfortune over-the-top it's also very obvious the only thing it's not really part of the, because you can miss play a days does braccus possibly going a P with a comment locked in there of course in a rain in the first place but it probably swing Aftershock regardless so it may well be AP gragas of the top side that means that the who he and closer to tank for the most part I might be difficult but we'll see if they can make that would happen as I'm still very interested to see what perks and Sven can do as the primary carries but of course can do really nicely on the Kindred as well as long as you don't get run down by an Olaf in the early game and I would definitely highly highly value AP gragas hairburst gragas over tank gragas because you are not trying for your overall game plan here for lunch with these to get to later stages of do front to back with you know it take EBT Boi. There's too much support and licking scaling with all these shields compounding on cloud nine that's what they want they want to be able to set up a vellios for Godlike late-game carries here we can do it all to save them solo Lane Lulu buffing of up so I would much rather prefer some day to go with the AP burst try and get that first kill you if you get a priority Target yes it is messed up over there errors that could occur here with your goddess and it doesn't have the best setup but you have to have confidence in your play when you're going for an aggressive style like this actually the case so let's make sure the coordination is on point here as we start early wave clear and after watching some day lineup against fudge one thing I found out stats command of this game was the fact that the new lineup and Afraid you know how could they not be at Opry team statistically so far Justin Ladyface some deicide a week or first 10 minutes then hauntzer did last year there's more Lenny face of course has more League of Legends but just statistically the early game so they has been yeah and I definitely know some of that where those statistics are coming from to look the actual games remember specifically that Jack's game where he did not get jungle pressure from his own team from closer got camps fairly hard plus his game for self re did not go that well in the lane phase the atrox into a neck towel bar I definitely hurting those Siesta Resort and give it to himself whilst we shall see how that Bears this time around because we expect so far no closer to continue power steering here on the Olaf should probably prioritize the bottom Scuttle crab because you're at you're not trying to to gank four-year-old for your gragas super early on for the for the wind condition for your team to try to put some pressure switch off the laying on bottom side with your Misfortune Rail and gain Sympathy for the exceptionally well is the play around bottom side some days frequently on an island left alone sure whatever but there's so many things like this because they're going to set up for a three-on-two referring to in the bottom line and someone's going to die it will happen to the quarterfinals but I've been inflated a group stage games here as well get some of the very very strong teams like Team Liquid make it still make those diets work against incredibly smart players it's likely to happen again if you look at the Gold stats for every player in this game is not going to be careful he'll be fine. For gold purse in the first 10 largest a bottle for these they just learned more than every 2.2 ever again because those diet work to get place to get kills and don't you give up against them and the biggest thing to is that they've been so efficient about they have it diverted closers routes our made him wait around a long time for these plays and I think a lot of credit does go to Devonte and midlane who has been so good with controlling it to wait for these times you'll see so many of these rooms prepped where he focuses uses a lot of his health a lot of his Manda even is teleport here already super early on the bill to get those windows to work with closer so they can have a very successful and efficient Kang and this person talking to me anyways this is a couple of the turret some day going to go for a bit of damage Stone teleport through the shield not much else to do and someday chugs through to get from it will matter when he needs it but still running a bit low bladder closer to my day going to be pretty soon topside is closer about these chickens being inside a big backup it also possible topside divulge already boarded some people have two medical foot pedal buddy first plug goes to cloud nine hundred thieves is Daisy the teleport and they still make the call to try and burn the kill and get out afterwards closer flashing to try to finish it up but already we see the Shields coming in the front Grayson starts to brew here four hundred thieves someday take sat hours. Uses full combo before the rest of the squad arrives so they don't have to knock up there to my day does get the talk but he doesn't damage that uses just as much to gain range and then not being able to get off that last little bit of damage 400 these not only does fudge survive but Cloud 9 get first blood and you're giving money already over to the team that has great scaling but when your Leah fellows here for you can you see your top side getting a Teleport counter play defending the dive getting first blood money in that you are so so happy smartpractice plays do person recall before that fight started so I think the guy was coming had the Mana pool to make sure that fight went pretty well and pretty good stuff right now I will the line Demonte for the Miss just as fine she was not one of a crow he did a very standard talk to the backwards e but it's a range Champion that range was not Erin just with it and that's that's unfortunate if you know if it's a missed play but that's what came out at the end so Cloud 9 off weed 900 goldleaf feels pretty good so far but when it's already recalled for the first time they got in their items across bladder nice gets what should be the second mark off of the graph steel and now we got to drive into town from your hundred things with a bit of pressure in the Box side mate still mostly able to trust me or against perks going to feel really comfortable in doing good still keep up the pressure regardless of failing that play on the dive on topside early that's what they're this is what they're comp is built to do they have to continue with it now they've got a galleon ultimate so closer just takes his momentum here on Olaf from Dragon up into the blue but to steal away while his bottom Lanes trying hard to push the way of making priorities well no Smite for bladder knows the blues happening can't make anything happen out of it regardless closer does Brenda Snipes mix to replace it on level 6 guess the buff Steel a while back I was to the Kindred Marcus pretty nice guy struggling there who he get the den to 1 HP FBI take the last hit on the control for it because you're 80 carries more beneficial than funneling it also nice optimization most good teams do that protest any sports out there who won more games just do it. There is a big timer to think about the super successfully for Cloud 9 on the top side but they have no more teleports left say hi to expend everything here for the early game so again it is still the same game plan for untruth he's they should move over closer to pressure for that invade I looked at to make another. I want to see it then I want to see whether to move his mate is on the way over right now through his own control board is the second one turns off of that trinket as well should know bladders over there will just write the board and may give pain go back over to close a result of that one but not going to be too much for Atlanta to bad for Sunday cuz you can see yes has the app to him has the tear is going for a standard AP gragas stuff. Maybe the best item of the game and so everyone who uses FBI roaming up wow closer starts off the rip tale so two players that went to hear four hundred thieves they make a full rotation of everybody up towards the top side of the map of abandoning that minion wave down bottom in yeah it's been does get to blow it up or push it in but resulted in to fold Victory here for a hundred thieves someday Ernie pressure at top site to since he had so much confidence with the rest of his days very end to make sure your cat the game plan freak everybody up there even FBI and who he are buying it. This that is huge huge proactive play from hundred thieves during the time. That we wanted it we're looking at those teleport cooldown they don't have those they don't have to flash their auto warranty
there but all the teams are alive and we'll see which team to go to sneak at the very end right now we have two teams who are locked in the playoffs Evil Genius and hundred thieves all right so right into it and once that's was talking about Top Lane Champions obviously that's always important with you know players like someday and hooty hooty already on the band fear this has been very easy for complaint against Evil Geniuses Gangplank Rumble Visa are always the Champions that you associate with him because those are the ones who performs on and it's still true this split we start Evil Geniuses is Kenan game really rough with his flanks is Camille game even worse as he got sold out by Ann orellana so right off the bat Hunter these Banning away the rumble lot of feedback be left up the Gangplank to their own detriment and his heavily for it all righty tighty off of getting rid of a lot of aggressive strong laners being notoriously has a very very small champion pool is very small. Cuz it is a point people keep on bringing up and bring up these points a lot with players even that we have had long career that long stretches of success with multiple murders yes bank has played only a few Champions failures as real but those are the champions at the top of the teeless 480 carries and I don't think it it speak to hey Bank can't play other Marksman what do you know this is one of the guys that's been playing the game for we will no longer stretches that we have had in professional play I think he's they're just following the tier list it's it's not really restrictions on him as a player thing right because I totally agree that you know if you take us to do this to you he's he's a big members of the highest but every other 80 carries well okay if I could play as real as Varys Game of us was the best day to carry I have a pic today but talk to you lady Carey play syndra here and then he didn't properly lost that's what I was there right with you anyways I can see the prove it yet cuz we have to see how well he did but the point guard for an anyways if I still could be a flex by the way I have actually played a game with Hootie top Calista and he dominated on it yeah you know that's so cute anecdotal evidence on a flex tr8 very easily cancel play solo Lane even have seen a few people playing at midlane so keeping the door open their hearts with these obviously don't think that could be a champion I don't think it is either and they're going to ban out some of the Golden Goose tile at longer range control Mage has he had a good as your game where he carried for them yesterday you know by the way man who needs healing solo queue that's good I like that Kobe off the table Sunday yet or Advance against hundred thieves as we saw from crumbs on the envelope says indeed somebody is a 0 and 3 on the pic give this man of fighter XIV of these are on right side they can save counterpick for someday I expect a blind bit later here for Ryoma right now so is still up would be a need to pick for him will still come through and as you mention the cliff that can be flexible enough to bend down there as well honey G getting rid of fighter toppings or something yeah and I think everybody is kind of on the edge of their seats hundred the saving Red Sox Pick 4 Sunday that's what teams want you know when you're looking at a hundred deeds and especially since they have in Italy you expect really high pressure Lance now is a Galileo locked in hundreds of bullies that up for very high pressure contract jungle trying to invade with Italy and multiple Global's to back him up so easy right now since they have to Blind their top laner for uni they just need to get some some lanes that you can have pretty much all purpose strong Lane faith in my opinion cuz that's what they're going to have to defend again and now is the moment of truth is it going to be a spell Elaine Calista or is that indeed Banks pick as we would get am kind of see in Spanish through the top 5 is a very safe blind top laner it is going to be calistic game of the split we know we can play it want to see if you were alongside Zazzle has pretty safe a chip in a lot of cases can withstand a lot of Fighters with the Dodge Zone animated Camille going to come in and set the Magnolia is very strong is the Bible top when I think we're going to see exactly exactly the question that I was supposed Evil Geniuses who I'm talking about super high aggressive playstyle from hundred thieves trying to invade in Jungle Dennis perfect you have a global you can answer their Global's with you can use defensive Stand United or you can use Stand United extremely aggressively with thrash Graves invades and that is what I want to see from Evil Geniuses the big question mark for me Corky for goldenglue generally they're going to try and farm up early will have a pretty easy Lane vs galio but when he gets the package 8 minutes I want to see EG completely change perspective here if they need to play aggressive off these packages time them with the dragons the timer's perfectly steamed up you basically have 5 minutes cuz it's a 4 minute plus adoration is one extra minute and that's how you should be able to win the game yet and the Foresters even Asian delivery system right if you really want who needs a note on the go to glue he died in the back line to deliver Shen back there you get an EZ Dodge you get any to taunt needs to feel good about that one and I'm kind of happens what what comes through here for EG we know they're going to be fifth or sixth seed in playoffs no matter what best they can fight for seating but we know they're up a bracket the question now is what form are you in when you take on a first-round opponent be at 90th samor flyquest think they're only possible first-round a you got to get ready for that matter cuz that's next weekend and you're gonna play best-of-five how good can you get goldenglue was awesome yesterday one death where he said they were sending the Top Lane and unit rate his here he is again on Corky another backline high damage champion in a year and in a gallon to see if he is on for because of Cordon Bleu is playing at that level is a very very scary team with retinol 3 length of golden glue goes back to you know Springs put golden guardians or early where he he can't have a consistent performances than EG look a lot more Mortal so I want to see what can happen on this quirky me know how to decide we know they're going to be on the lower bracket side waiting for their first appointment I don't see if they can get ya and once again they're taking the Natalie something must have happened in scrims because we got like three already this last week and the team's still have been kind of struggling with fully utilizing the Champions get really getting the most out of the counter jungling and the speed claim with a champion did Italy also of course is going to bring the kids later for a little bit to stain and can possibly set you up with poke but I think the thing they're trying to highlight is galio mid lane plus the aggressor Italy this is something that hundred thieves did when they first put in contracts they are able to get Ryoma the galio which is a perfect Champion for him supportive to the more aggressive players on the team and we get to see someday play the champion belt lost them their game just yesterday where it was Viper on the Camille do you know played Camille into some days or three items that got to ignore the tank and split push to victory in eventually eat eventually had a drop that game this time around someday is on the commune style everyone expect out of hundreds he's all year long you got one of the best top laners in the world on a lower half TV else in this guy is your wind condition it has been the case back with their first wedding splits or at least two regular-season it's the case here still at 6 and 11 Sunday is the man to look at and he got the chance to do it Sunday is also a very good take glare at has her a history of being a good team player most people do agree with you as far as the team doesn't have many other players at his caliber they have no they don't want to use him you're in a damaged dealing position also their game yesterday had a lot of other things I mean what is a 6 and 11 teeth there are flaws in hundredths he's right there not a perfect team two players are not on Sundays level into those why is Orrin in his bow kayak malfeitor all very good but he's got to carry this team and it's not just well my own engagement pretty good A lot of players can do that you do want to see a monster fish on a carry Duty so you know that is the point kind of being made I know you're not even supposed to make me different point there I just want to really clarify the stance that yeah someday caring is it site so maybe he's going for more of a full clear Natalie up towards the top side and then tries to put the map because who needs pulled with been scaring he's trying to give to skin a little bit of extra damage then actually gives a really good least as far as solo Lanes & Stitch go because of the Q start out and get a huge amount of percentage Health damage you can do to the blue so it really does accelerate the graves clear which is already quite Wiccan it since it's a no power for Members 1st power farmer match up with Natalie Graves we'll see if that actually can go a long way I just he's already trying to keep track of sense can you solve Ryoma on your mini-map there with a galio pushing up and trying to get in for a wart so they know he's out of fairly quick clip here on his clear down towards the bottom side and that should signal to Cody's son in whom they need their Wards up and they need to be fairly careful Graves obviously with that ask and circumvent the common tribe record and dash over the dragon wall nice Claret they are talk through but he hitting the shield from Sunday who goes back into the socket the Empower to nice play there are the Camille this matchup really interesting to watch cuz they both have self shielding they both got different amounts of range tools you know if u q auto pack on Hoon you get this filled to the trade some day goes in for the range damage to get to the slowing of the he'll back you can you put on a dog's going can you play run the taunt really like seven different blends to track and play around that matchup definitely very compelling verse which goes through the Sunday but he's now out of Manus was going to see this through for just a second doran's blade and maybe waiting for a potion before I get back in the lane and this is what I'm talking about with Graves having the ability to get down to bottom Lance circumvent those wards looks like we're not going to go to the shop here as well and that's going to be first one in the bottom Lane things are going to lose his wife as well literally everyone in the bottom Lane it's a 5V 3 pipes received ready for that play no hesitation on the double teleport from their solo laners everybody down to the bottom Lane Cody sunset set the bat signal and answer the call you can see how they're playing really really far back very defensively for them so it's been scaring his attempt to your Shout Out by hundred thieves and the trap has already been laid some day gets the key off the wall immediately into the top for my oma just beautiful layering of the crowd control their from The Double Cola laners a project even heading down for the spear to claim the gold for himself and I got to say someday was being toppling instead he'd be recalled to pick II Orange Play he got the refillable and Tapas going into history is a chance that guy was about to hit that button topside and as the gate came in he was always be here and it got them Outlook ambulance shots done so well done of course to The Entity side to put wheels on the bottom side 111 went on to the galio they are the ones with the money he can't push on top fast enough in line bus from Sunday that farm is equal to the two of them everything they would want exactly sells up for Success has a huge bike when you complete runic Echoes that item just gives you so much burst damage and it really puts New Leaf over the edge of the contractors using electrocute so you have this kind of break point where as soon as you can rush to your ruin it echoes completion Italy gets the power to is basically hundred percent to zero somebody if you land the beer with her full combo at once again contract is heading through the bottom side hovering here waiting for the possible since Karen came back in the bottom side yeah that's black Pumas do around as well with guardian and his own shop keeps flashing really needs it contracts right now though going to pull the Drake out of the pit for the floor down cuz Okay you can see me but it doesn't matter has Mike Pence during the same and equal level looks like he is unwilling to try you put last plant over the wall and then yeah like there isn't that much risk on Spencer Drive that said not going to go for the play and it's going to be the Drake picked up he's about a thief so I also would be really scared of that incense Karen Uhl position because they pulled the dragon out
yeah we were taking a look at it you know I love the fast for these players or Tuesday in the ranks as one of his not be worse later in Academy later so how he will stand up the power of evil has a really big question for me and then also he'll have to go up against this key if he stays in the lineup so you know you're putting perhaps of the weakest lehner in Academy up against two of the best in the ALCS in and you expect that to be a bit of a recipe for disaster but that being said no he does have the inbuilt Synergy and practice with fraga's jungle mid is incredibly important they are to maybe they are just looking more to maintain that and feel bad as more important also has to be said just like the fact that pole vaulter hasn't performed pretty well overall in the Asia and they're not winning with him so I respect taking the shot at a bit of a Hail Mary here say hey we're expecting a loose anyway let's change something up let's see if we can inject a little excitement into the roster and I'm sure they're there their down in the dumps a bit do you bring in some Academy playersbring it to New energy you see if you can pick something up gravel win as cure playoffs and it will say if my recollection is proper that since Immortals have lost the worst sealed you can do is a tiebreaker at 5 and Tina cross the board's I believe they're one and one against both those things are girls who shouldn't be anything but that if it feels when you come through so obviously you win here today or you in tomorrow for you when your tie breaker and see make it into playoffs Anderson what was making sure that we have the right Rasta to go but the best I can tell their fate is in their own hands for Sylvia Michael stupid habit of course they can get second they can get 3rd I will see what goes on for them it's going to be the early set pick up a very high price here in Pro play it has to be answered at a little Bantu when I'm really excited about and kind of frame for honestly is that Frank is because I was by it because it has been a really good for him in Academy that he had played it quite a lot news for plays 75% win rate it has been isbest performing Champion so that would be really exciting to that come into the ALCS with the set being picked up it doesn't fully eliminate the chance of that is this obviously could be still pop lane or midline we have been seeing a lot of those types of things make sense to to bring a different book right in the LCS so if you're trying to go for the for the upset play something that people are are less used to or less comfortable and buy a ticket to upset when I think if you do anything if you pick the set to grab the flex going into set is now less flexible it's only mid top jungle and I haven't seen ruin play set all split lawn mower have we really seeing Tuesday pics that one up so there's a chance to just simply goes to practice as his second most played of display regardless we'll see what comes down as Pee-Wee gets the law can be found a paper flight before the second round of band and one problem I do have with grabbing dinner Levi is that you could we play Pandora Top tentor even a Morgana and the old gets real use those real fast they'd be kind of place over these there's a little bit of a chance but I would love to see you order anything like that I don't think that they need to First Take it or it's going to take it away or whatever by the way you look at it when they played against a thousand times since Christmas this year is Dubai right so you know if I fly Quest eliminate that variable take away the vibe deny that opportunity for them to have to come mix things up but I think more than likely it probably is just set going to practice anyway we're not going to get that that excitement of the five pick because you said room hasn't played it Tuesday haven't played it in Academy so it's possible that I am expecting you to go to the jungle for now they are looking toward this part as real lame you're not not one of the strongest Laney do especially when you're up against the ass because there is the ability for it for things to be a bit rough downthe band of the reconnaissance very much ain't worth ignore who it is mostly by far he has been very effective climbing in different angles and flying with this but they can still go towards in his cancer support and I'm probably just slam this Lane and 6 a.m. and smoothie have been no one of the week is laners playing Duos in the ALCS so I think that's the only that that flag what could look who exploit lcog weakling is across-the-board really I'm looking over it with dragon tattoos different doing an academy they are down gold frequently and it's like to be the bad team they are fifth place at I think they end up night at 9 but they were eight eight with this roster like for Tuesday in that roster like they were an acceptable Academy team but they still have an early day and evening Academy is coming through Rumble by the way a flex pick between Rouen and Tuesday so that is beautiful double duty it does mean that syndra is up as a possibility or the winterwhat's the best type of spider. Ignore is exciting player he's a good engage player he's always doing the damn it not lesbian type is really really fun to watch this is not really for that that lady Duo I don't think I may be po16 definitely have to try to go to kill there at the blind tenant feels like that can be very punchable here know by solo we have seen can enlarged fairly ineffective throughout the LCS a soloist someone who does feel very comfortable going to a lot of the tanks you didn't even bring out the maokai I think that that is an option that they could be in a very strong for flyquest you can obviously go for some deranged mashups and I should just go right at the tenant to but it's going to be double AP cylinders overall early Magic Image heavy because you're expecting snow set to be tank then you have the double AP so later than Ezra with some mix damage Bart pretty much all magic damagealrighty well the roster has been locked in nothing surprising gear the vice sadly not going to be on the table it is set jungle as somewhat expected to come to the top so it'll be answered by mordekaiser which I like a lot in any given team fight one of the ways you can lose is a big cannons like a central team until it goes not to argue with me I'm the only getting done by 2:24 before I really really do like the mordekaiser as a duelist but as a team by team but I think it's a cool underwear with some good really do good wanders into flight cuz I also think that you can kind of do the same thing with whatever but you anyway we'll see how it goes I don't think that you know this is a match up at that should be that bad for solo but I do expect Canon to to have the run of the lane at least early on as long as you're actually eat a dodging out a lot of those goats Rats from from the ward in the grass beenI do think I have a pretty good time but overall a you know steals yet I think it is going to have to show something pretty special because he that they are a heavy underdogs here and there's good scaling over on the other side and I think flyquest have positioned themselves well too, play their style this is power of evil in his comfort zone playing a stealing Mage other as Frontline there is a gauge that is really everything that that's like us would need to play Yo very comfortable macro Style game and it's going to be up to see LG AI thinq to disrupt that yeah right is is CLG have to and realistically three games left to play in the regular season they're going to fight flyquest they're going to fight Cloud 9 I'm expecting them to lose both and that means they are almost certainly destined for a tiebreaker with dignitas and maybe Immortals and and they've got to figure out by that point in time with the best running 5 is what you know the strategy to be what the pigs need to be so they can get that last spot in plastic is only one spot left up for grabs and right now Dig InnCLG have five wins fighting for and they're going to battle later on he knows it to do it most likely I think we're selling them ever so slightly shorter these were already saying they're very good team but looking at the schedule I expect them to take to you some spot at third because he gets in fight with anybody right now it's like you know 12 and 6 and takes their see automatically it's okay here we go we're going to go fight niji down in the basement and clothes without the possibility that looks like regardless I do want to see how good likeness liquido the upper bracket we know there was a very slim chance to get the playoff bye and I don't want to see them tuned up and ready to go as a playoff threat they've also be some really good teams lately and a half I'll be at didn't have a great weekend to nail this weekend are they beat TL they btsm they have taken down some the very strong opponents they did lose to see Nye but that's their only loss of last six games and they are156 on a four-game winning streak they are shaping up in a right in the nick of time I think we're and I think rightfully so has been getting a lot of credit that he has been really intelligent about how he's actually playing out of these games how he's acting like he's able to find you a lot of really unique tank pads and angles at timings at players are not expecting that it's kind of really throwing them off so we'll see how far I get to deal with that Tuesday going to have the trip Bard health pack there from smoothie so Tuesday can have the advantage of not only that. The ocean but essentially an extra help ocean and a half or so of feeling that it's about 225 with that level one fence that they don't Stock Yards you taking stuff but I was quite a lot extra of help for that walk set start not a big shock right there, going to look like a camp that you do with machete trundle red to blue to grab to whatever else right now about pressureflyquest respect the fact that you spell right now we put the PAC Center mid you could only ever have three so until Tuesday Isom you literally couldn't read W because then why'd you put them down to the first place so that's okay like a push down Tuesday office early aggression whatever could help back pain so in any sort of like even trade even take his is on his way of winning trade that's kind of how you get the most use out of this hell facts and also to your point you can if you place until they have started to be taken down that bot Lane so you're taking the Trade Center get use out of them now allows about Landon and having blue to be too also very severe Terrace on that trade you know all the money's going one way so Tuesday off literally could start right there ruin pushing in Solo I don't imagine the only one looks that good I feel like Canon has a pretty easy time dodging do the backwards cloth the attack trained to chew on it pretty well you can Auto them backI'll just pack up and knock it pulled either so far so good foot again I don't really listen to I don't and it's just completely ruined once you get there and I'll talk to the possibility but I still like to get there I do think that you know you should be fine but you shouldn't get absolutely blown out in especially if you're if you're worried about that as solo you can go fairly expensive Bruins obviously it's Shield going to resolve secondary and he actually has Suites on 2nd wins does that is really the like I don't want to lose vs. range setup Doran Shield plus second wind is more than enough usually to keep you pretty healthy so unless you get sad over something I don't expect this to get out of control but brightness is passing up here I don't think they can even look for it though and be able to be at a pressure bandage but they even a shin farm and go from therestains out of his class and that is a nice Real Madrid Lane ignite down but they do get that flash unfortunate inform got hit by that same stuff done as ignore actually pillard in Tuesday immediately after the flash I think that is a kill to credit for Tuesday for a really well placed knock back there and solo Linea a couple of Bowls does being ruined his is getting the worst trade analyzer slat is going to get like to give him a free free push it's really just all about actually dodging the cloud when was guaranteed the timing is such that the cop pulls you in and the key was bumper and it will always land on you if you really have to avoid that one still more than anything else on the bottom side while not quite a few nice try to really try those other it through Atlanta on one Castor plant behind for the living well enough not the end of the day it's going to be pretty easy for himso this is a very atypical you almost always will see the chilling Smite Intuit davanni has very aggressive to me this is because you're clear is going to be much worse when you're actually having a very late dinner hold your overall team fighting is going to be a lot weaker it's kind of somewhat similar in that means not a one-to-one comparison but we just have a lot of lease and there was like the movies Russell East Side games where it's like you're investing into moose means you can be everywhere so you can be more effective when the Gangsta and really get something done and to me it if ragus can't make anything happen before punches Kenny out for the Blast code that's not too bad I can't get all the way over the wall but he's still invisible talk to the runaway no problem there send torrents cuz if it's worth of plastic brackets did so through the scuffle there they do get the flash off of ignar to so it is a bit of a trade overallsafe no Seraph lackluster pretty happy with that no getting that flash off for I guess if you're the best in the early fifties just need to learn is going to be way ahead on the jungle item completion self-effacing to track that going for it you're done here for six days he is down in laying he hasn't used to teleport yet though so we'll see if they can find any sort of a window to it's a really kind of an advantage or or claw back here in this to be too with that teleport very very tight game between these two squads bought laying into in support so very tight one right now about Drake the slowest of Drake's to kill the lowest threats as well and with machete has okay damage and a shows up they are going to knock his grace back right now for the eagle in the early games so far is sent or it going to take I said it's also track
they are closing games better all the good stuff is going on TL very much improved in the second half and their loss is really in the summer split be coming from the first game to fly quest in the second part of the proof round-robin it was a Ford Credit they were getting a bunch of nut gear was across the ninth with kind of one of eight game best record ever in this playoff format. 15 and 3 inch healer poised to make them for themselves so this is a macro picture one of the best flips ever in recent memory is Team Liquid right hereI hope so Tim McGraw. I agree I mean they had to happen to him very very well they've been so incredibly dominant especially against the lower to your team's none of those games have looked even remotely close their losses have been only to some of the top four teams in EG obviously not as good in the second half of the first I was there looking like one of those really good team but it seems like a mortal see if it's been just destroying them so I am expecting TL to be able to continue along those lies to be able to grab a win here to cure first place until then I'll continue that Improvement I think you know the questions for TL are no longer about the regular season this how we stand up in a best-of-five they have drafted know very much towards play Candice rafted very very standard they never really mix it up whatsoever so people are wondering who can that be exploited come playoff time because they are a team that doesn't really have a lot of Champions play slow and no maybe a TSM or a C9 are there someone to throw a curveball and try to take advantage of that. Did the number one or two thicken Pro play right now Boulevard I think tide for that kind of spot and very very strong here as well and was interesting is with the karma band would it harder to find a good Lane match up with into Caitlin skateboard very very strong upon aquaflame several times before and it's so hard to beat overall and with a fresh you're not looking to win through late I mean if you can get them released play where your fork visit making am I hooking right and left I'm going to hit both of you and you guys want to blackfield yeah you kill whoever you didn't block Shield right but that's tough to try to make happen in any part of your under your trip so I really heavily favored Immortals do a late but hey it's out of land as bad as a monster is going to get other things to happen that's one of the things that you can always remember is that sometimes the best way to challenge the unbeatable to be to South Lanes is actually forced the opponent support to Rome with you right so if you can actually get movies get out of Lane as that thresh Force the Morgana to try to answer because you're putting on so much pressure towards the midline for the jungler is that can be a way they can break up that to be true that you are expected to lose try to make things happen obviously the act as a lot of utility to help those kind of fights also you could spot out the jungle you can spot out these movement around the map with the hot shot and try to find Windows of attack an Indica at Lisa's right these plays can convert Leigh hoppen Team Liquid have found ways to do so they actually have gotten better and better in the early game they've got other things I'm incredibly strong to go to put the wrong on red sign I'm kind of expecting them to save last pick for him to make sure he can get a good counter pick you were seeing the Shop blind overall game I think these are probably the best bands you can get from Mortals looking at this graph State I think that's the best I could possibly do Olaf game farm Heavy Champion where you you kind of put more the eggs in his basket to carry he's really much more supportive overall to take kind of broad Strokes here for top-line it's not even though it's been Panic not even one of the most that she has been ban against them even in the top-six so I think they never do go to it so if it's Mitzi can perform that is mean big things here for we had seen a number of really dominant carry style games from Olaf's troupe is split I do think that Mortals have pretty powerful they gave the cured here with the Caitlin a 12v is here they're lacking engaged though and they're kind of lacking some of the support of style tools for the Olaf to give him the war of the lasting power in the game if he's going to be strong early game no matter what but if you don't have any sort of support for if you don't have the dive buddies for him a lot is going to be for worthless late so I think they need to draft the Top Lane Scion is going to be DFA but honestly is not like reliable hard engage like you that you can kind of salt in there but it's pretty easy to do step in front of that is one of the members buried that from coming through ya I guess you can like tank in front of it yeah the orokin W into it as well you're right if you still go off if you're going to like this why you off and just bring her out now I got to walk the number one spot in a chance to borrow against the at them as well kill to do that but they are now a window behind play a position filled in dignitas or at 5 or tomorrow to play a tiebreaker or hey if it was Ghost with some luck they just get to spot at 6 wins for The Mortals are fighting for their playoff lies they've got to win at least one of the next you will see if they can do that at some point Pacific side and graph you've got a counter pick a collie from Jensen is going to be hype and it is going to be very very exciting and you are right it is 1016 where those boss came through for a call either win rate went up a couple percent a very significant thing that we saw collie and Lucien both this weekend in a solution ekali right before their Bluffs when we haven't actually seen them coming out before this is this is a big step away from what TL has been doing though they're consistent image of this cough is pretty bad when you're looking actually over at it it's basically just the ash you have essentially three tanks if we kind of put rush into that sort of in a bucket and then you have an assassin and and scissor of dairy a typical composition here from TL it's it's not as though they are just guaranteed to win the fight if they sit back yeah I think that they could easily lose if they are not proactive so they're going to show us a bit of a different look like he is playing Just magically Champion azir LeBlanc TF do it like that is all he plays he is back to assassins here and I don't see how it goes and I want to give credit insanity is a very very good player I think he is a he and tactical or my easy front running for rookie of the year I think they've both been very good so far in 2020 Immortals going for a late invade here on the Olaf to try to find themselves in early chunk they are going to I believe fully shipped the night here I don't believe anyone saw each other on the way in but it's easy blue Bastille as rocks it is doing I like this look at Rox is doing his like no leash Red Bluff topside we get an early aggressive-looking and from Impact say okay it's not a Blue Bell start from the old but with this passing it with hot oil coming from the top side of the river through. Brush it means if they know of anybody who yep do they know that is actually a pretty risky move there from from Mortal things you missed the finding so that's what that was enough movie First Blood coming through Apollo took a long fight with stomach hurt even if they were fine if they had something else they were fine so I can ignite but they didn't have all the combat Summoners and now the re-engage portege will not be rude tattoo can walk back the lane and all my gosh PL got handed first one of the bot Lane the full hundred to do all in after the Mystic binding I mean they do if you do cuz it cuz that was pretty bizarre I understand that it's a fairly strong what's a binding misses you just need to walk the long way around instead they walk in the flight lands here from core the day they get that early heal and then just feel like we got a little bit dated perhaps know by this by now because the night still comes through that he had already but use early for the he gets laid in again and then goes for the que hierba flash is still available to tackle the night splash I was that was not even like the best case for some reason but court is it was still full helping the other two were still going to die right it's not as though you were about to win that fight so pretty surprising at the very least though so far so they did push it back to base the first one went score JJ so it doesn't really matter that much and we'll see if the Immortals 2 V2 can recover from here and try to take it as they would have more expecting a plane from the end of the day there is still so dirty. Use a plate 40 take me to the bottom side shock comes down from lorman time comes for with the matchup what you see or NW to start charging you let it go for a auto see what's going to work out so Lauren really liking this matchup but right now his back is winning in farm what are you taking some decent early plays I was he forced himself is either Ruby Crystal doran's ring from earlier on yes if I could have been informed by a lot lately careful round dinks in the top side cuz broxah is already here use the word but if he if he's just a little bit more far forward I think it's easy as can be probably dead I could not live this I don't want to find a stud he's going to flash back with you got to be kidding me they actually meant to find a way to be W I can't believe they got this one Rock The Flash the sun couldn't get it in time that was a great turn around there are able to flash out by time he arrives Insanity with the quick TP and they do end up getting the kill their over onto their Olaf and 1/4 impact back to base his TV is going to have to be used it was some Farm midlane but well worth it there as a protector top cleaner and get a kill alarm when it was very far up in this is not top hits you think he's probably dead you are assuming that the Olaf will not be here in time to save him but in he goes there you goes off at the same time knocking a processor Insanity arrives there's no TP on rocks are there and they have overcommitted USA got that kill zombies enough to help turn that one around so after the TV is coming through the best case for sale was the one for one but it ends up being a 1/4 yeah I just want to see if rocks with flash sideways a little bit like it's warded you know where the key was coming from just just don't these guns are 300 damage that's lights a little bit better at least I think that is mechanical Miss Play My Darling by Cady Stanton dlpc level differences would go for the all-in but doesn't care what they kill will have the family will enforce is Saturday to recall and he does not have to eat this will be a lot of his way of getting canceled as that is a freezer for the turf attentive as a freeze he get the flat also so really nicely done their way Jensen you know that was the other part of what has been the actually lost and I mentioned the farm but he seems nice. now that's the way these roads on in the spare Lee problematic because that just leads to an extent instead Jensen just want to save it to be so he's just going to go back to Basics by after that push he will deny more farm so just trying to make the most out of that TV to top link from Insanity telmate a the TV Advantage he'll be up for him up experience then I able to get back to base and grab another loss or overall game state right now 100 gold lead the Team Liquid oxy first blood is some of that but there was one could have backed by a mortal overall Farm advantage of the top side of his the Middle Lane and different spot that's probably fairly close overall in the game is really close overall level 6 on Bill top leaders here TV up for a lure him down for in fact Flash the other way around 4th and Pac Tulsa what place in the queue in this could be damaged matchup for Warren is you can see when you're forced actually see s s ion is in this case will see if I can catch him back. But when you don't have access to walk up and finish them off with your melee so it does result in you bleeding farm when you are into Lisa 76 matches SI impact sling it well and punishing as much as you can today trying to maintain a pretty strong for him vanish just look at Barclays. At NCS difference here for Apollo NACA will get a lot of that was the fact that special how to instantly recall off the first wait after getting that is fitted with only assist me to build a bear with bottling pressure and middling pressure just need to walk it over to help me get that plywood Rick picked up before 8 minutes so far so good to look at to be really comfortable with us early game is going and honestly not a farm in a disadvantage of Bartlett. Took a pretty good as well exactly I mean when you have a stress into the cave Morgana and in your playing you into an Olaf and you're the one getting the dragons you're going to be pretty damn happy about that that being said Mortals does have a lot of scaling so it's not the standard TL style of game where they can kind of just depend on their late game and say all right to sit back and take the incremental advantages you do want to see them
but if he's losing Fatima still closed behind them they play each other tomorrow if EG when's the day that your top 6 in the top half in the first round have yet to get a 10-win split in their history in the LCS at first year back to back pain it got better year was can you get a positive with rate split can you get 10 and 8 or better and EG is our chance to do that hereexactly an mp4 thinking that they were going to be able to get to it for sure you know based on their their recent perfomance they have been looking really good. They were on an 8 and 3 run for them they can achieve that 10-win slippity g would like to deny that and secure their upper bracket appearance here for playoffs golden Guardians also still hunting for that first playoff win so that will be here waiting on their minds does it go into playoffs then you do will go free picks set obviously is a flex pack but most of these days we are seeing a fair bit midlane as well as it has been acting more popular mid-length then top lately shirt yeah Mr Lyon right here of course everything but Caitlin is available in here and go from Oregon to hear the junglealso could have gotten better over time picking up win after win now and we'll see what easy fix and response despite having some pretty strong your individual performances you know it's lame Horizon to Brock the but it was still in a lawsuit I do believe those are also out of their dragon so lost games so he has been good in the early game but you know him as well to team obviously he's just one part of it have been unable to close out games when he is on Italy will see if they can Rectify that here looking like Senate can't stop it up throw back down in the bottom Lane going to be a sissy if it is Farmington it feels like that has a dent out of the go do yeah we're not really seeing that the vast extent of these days at all so I am expecting this to be at the farming setup to use that up against Costa is a strong later and if you're expecting in or some sort of all in support to be paired alongside the cliff that makes sense asdenial to something like the threat she what you might expect you paired alongside it apart you could be a strong option here for Hui I do think it has been one of his best pixie has been really looking good on this then a has played it three times now to wins on the four already there is also more of an ability I think you just kind of bully out that Tom can cause you to have double range here and give it that to even go for him instead of canceling I think going after Senator just like almost always beautiful but at least you know I'm here for Zanesville again I really was expecting gang to be the son of Laertes played it once already this split I feel like he's going to bake that cake number to work in like eight games can you play with a second set of game here otherwise in Australia says Realty like the year for the blindwhat are the top laner Rumble is still available right now in back at the bands come through Rumble is still available for Hootie that's going to line up pretty well ready if you're leaving us up this late in the draft so we'll see what comes through as well so that Golden Gardens of course need their solos and with this set Flex kind of the same also available in a really strong pick for uni is dominated in the ALCS on it you did better in a cat reaction trouble but didn't pick up a win on his one Rumble game in the ALCS and you know what other things do with Santa that I do feel like you need it is it some sort of height adjusting TPS Champion right because if you're going to have a tank set which is most likely what we're going to see the time can't you just don't have a lot of DPS may not matter as much as golden Guardians don't go forward that you know any sort of Frontline here as as Barton and Italy Kandi Burruss down our necks and complicate things a little bitI really high DPS pairing with Santa may be kind of relaxed a little bit now it is Alice yesterday had a solid game but decent was the better team overall where is set going to the golden blue playing at the bank and Spence. Ignore the damage is it going to be grabbing you know when or Jana or a syndra or something else down here the Zoe is of course gone but what is it going to be at CVS you said it you want some more damage to help complement the fact that they're sending in the lineup and his beer with the first pick of the split for cold and flu but it would be consistentyeah I think it makes a lot of sense alongside this type of composition you don't have a lot here from Yu-Gi-Oh you are looking for a plank in our but there is no incredible go button on the side of e g I do think that depart ultimatum is more powerful in that regard. Coming over from Golden gar teeth brushing to Get N Go here so this is kind of feeling a bit of a throwback to words are early days where you know they were going more towards bush-style more towards 131 it does feel like they're kind of leaning towards that try to play towards Dragon stacking with your Calista a Bard Lane on top of the noodle used to Crave power farmer you're trying to get ahead in that regard and then send Echo out to the side light and see what we can get done there at 5 to see how effective that too because I do favor EGS rate of v e v I think sure-lite a bit I think that the execution is going to be very difficult for Champions like the echo life in Italy when you are going out for a team fightplay with Tom kench over on that other side and complicate things for the champion to want to dive in and 0 someone out of the Nar I think also makes quite a bit of sense I think it's actually a fairly strong match up into the Renekton you do have to be wary of all Lynn's you don't have to come out of Mega are actually exhausted you can potentially be in trouble there but it also suits back in the day when our was actually very very popular kind of guy who would go for like pee Dean are in these hardcore went against the bush Styles have a lot of option but very effective you can also build worth inviting a dentist give who need the ability to play pretty aggressively to push very aggressively in and still have the ability to escapealrighty well we are on the wrist Evil Geniuses can lock themselves in Upper bracket spot in the playoffs Golden Gardens tickets are best split ever with a win here today 10 and ate their first time ever going to possibly right at the end of the regularly scheduled games golden Guardians have been very hype this split come on Take Aim and people are ready to see the froster really really rounded out in the beat the lights of Cloud 9 they have taken down some decent names people are saying okay are Golden Gardens now at the real deal he zhi it it's been such a weird summer split for them they were the second-place finisher in summer they were the third star in Spring season third-place finisher in playoffs after 5 and 5 start with their old roster they signed they brought me in this group these five are only 2 and 4 is not his going to go in front of truck gold and blue here nice Health far lead a little bit of award and, and lands and damned if there was well spentit would have actually been a really big deal to get that third it both for the the path of prophet also is like she would have talked then right so that would have actually been pretty significant Health leave a comment back on the way out so we'll be pretty happy about that and it again so soon after after the games today and then find out know what is is leading to the sort of the change because they sound really see a lot of it so like you haven't seen it really at all in Pro but I think it's better but there was some very good players playing and myself so, and if people just like to stack up at 3 Health shrines at level one who give themselves essentially an extra health potion to the half about what it works out too or that laning phasebut it is actually you know that the resources being taxed more heavily from the golden Guardians bottom line Jews are the ones who had to actually use their potion instead of sitting on still posting a biscuit and has all his potion self are they did end up taking the worst end of that trade as the weather gets pushed into this Lane is going to be a partial free this got to look like the minions but I'll see. He's going to push it down keep the wave at equilibrium you can pretty easy job there Auto attack reset down three Siesta hoodie as the erline are pushing is going pretty well for him so far so good down there jungles keeping equal hunter gets know what power is done through did have all the rage but believe he was 1 hour away from Howard Hughes and get quite everything you wantedyeah you know I wasn't sure if he was trying to actually paid out the Hop there because you know any early levels that the Hop for Nars a fairly long cool down so if you can actually get him to use that without expending a lot of your abilities than you have potentially and Paul in window here in this position I'm surprised you did Lane I feel like you could have just waited it out. But maybe they're feeling like okay doodle is going to coming up here we don't have time to wait but there may have been before.you almost done who he was with it too far away from bank but he cute the Caster thing did not get stung though they're all just fine small CST to the garden spot Lane the more that you can trade the better for being else you want to Stack Souls get the Q Autos who he going to get an auto on a champion now no more souls they are but regardless it's a lot of pressure here inside in Spencer and showed in top they know there's no threat did you see your face. Bank but it goes right back to the Tomcats belly and gets back out almost the roots and it's going to take the van back up in a Biscuit they're obviously all of the Q healing gear from bang how you going to make things a little bit difficult there for the golden Guardians Lane but they were he can't be careful people have to get away and if I cannot find that killed but I killed a two-on-two time to walk away really nicely doneblade have been getting credit and rightfully so who is he has been so willing to trade as flash aggressively try to look for these types of plays I'm not looking very good as funny as it is sometimes any situations you can actually come up behind it doesn't seem like it is still going to in a push toward them now we'll have to see how it does end up in equilibrium out of here it's more time than that's why they can go for this play he hit the cue and then just flashing in get the ignite the auto rent comes through the crab First Look for their kalista I'm going to talk Die Trying To Die funi Here with this dream and play He Will Survive though and yep I haven't been back to base yet so that you're not that big a deal didn't even get his he's just going to be here as well as another safe but that was like a cyst on a little for jump Champion that I can be scary with the dragon hating you definitelyif you don't want it tonight early there and then risking of the Dragon of the date it was on the way over so you know not too bad they will just send it out to mid lane should be limping back fairly shortly but this is the correct way when you're actually cover you popped you can just walk mid you don't need to have both your soul in her up in the top link if you for that farm so they should both put up their wave and then you'll actually see them recall and swim But Wings back as well as soon as you get them learn for your own games and so that you actually go short on that coming through. So goes back topside they're going to get back to Myrtle Lane assignments or it's going to burn his pee pee to get topside to take his own recall grabs a piece of the last chance we can complete the People's Choice when he was able to recall outside so not the ideal power Spike but there's a job backthat is a very dead Champions right back out easily v y in Rome for the mate of stuff there they in for it they had seen is your midline they knew who needs and gold Loop both don't have teleport so at worst case it is actually you know that 43 set up for themselves and when you limit Echo stunt your guarantee to scale shots will hit from your teammates and Golden Gardens is having a great room they're putting a lot of pressure on to the Senate are you going to talk to the trade not much else to do you don't even really have a lot of control over when it's available for some damage resulting in the topside small farm deficit here for the Renekton gets really lose speed to help navigate to bhosle Ranch bash up his farm he had to be late game magic looks like down the line cuz you have seen already today top difference of matchup can when you again take that for sure we'll see if it does come to that obviously in a win who didn't have a lot of vision though the reason you think so respectfully is Renekton stun and sinitta least fear dead men are pretty much guaranteed so if you don't know we're closer is you have to play with respect to it that's one of the things that they that is so pickerel the Lord is good
right you know it is not one of those weeks were coming into to the final week of a split and it's still pretty much undecided you know yes there would have to be some some kind of crazy circumstances were some of the spots to really get disrupted but I do think it is going to be very exciting find a week here dignitas it they could grab a win here against her these they keep their chances alive and then would force the LG to try to have to get to win through for the tiebreaker that can open the door for her for a mortal's units but a three-way tiebreaker there's a lot of crazy scenarios that we could have and I do think that it's a very likely that we're going to at least have some tiebreakers on Sunday in a from what I've seen of 1 2 or 3 tiebreakers are all quite high like 35% or something so that way yes it overpercent just 3% X stand for in first this man has been very early game and talked about someday being a really big deal to topside and we think jungle made is going to be very important match up and Caitlin is a champion I think should be 100% pick ban in proflight it's only about two-thirds of that store that Caitlin is in way too late against her is to play Karma and some other arrangements with Ash is gone but you can find something else to eat the rain and try to keep letting pressure against her has become a really common pick into into Caitlin as well that in Pro play something that you can kind of survival a nun that's really dominate the way to get sealants do be interesting to see if Johnson wants to go that route if he does though I do think that that could be a bit concerning for dipping sauces to get to later stage of the game because Johnson is such a reliable carry for them to do in in that part of the game he is going to depend on very heavily I got a lot of damage done so if you put them on gin you may not necessarily have the other kind ofDPS that you really will need either way double mark them locked in here for a hundred thieves will be interesting to see if they want to go no more supportive lehner in one of the Soul Lanes as a result, has been taken away which what appeared quite well with them but there are obviously other enchanter options there are at so we get to see what the rest of the traffic going to be right now out of these how you plan on the bot Lane are you going to pick somewhere else and they are going for your tea in midlane Zoe and Grace will have a lot of early pressure here I think of how to make sure they can around out there but lay before the bands come through their thing as real as the only good later we're willing to play bands will get us to fight on the tier list which means you can cover it with counter picks by Banning things away and we'll see what it looks like now I mean it is interesting because it is such a priority pick for Jonathan ua7 plays on this soon as he has played in as Rakuten affiliate with tide at 2 I'll be there is no will now be his third play but by finding that out and then the fact that they didn't actually counter band The Caitlin they put themselves in into a pretty heavily Loumatch-up yes, we may be able to swing that somewhat this could also be karma is it so late we have to keep that option open to mention see where hundred thieves will go will they pick a strong lehner alongside the Caitlin I have been actually kind of disappointed by the fact that we're not seeing him the more laying down at the fourth like Nami coming out if you don't want to Blind pick Nami and and then get you into a Champions like that you can just devastate so these bands are amazing to me that this diarrhea and Ciroc are taking band because we don't see them practically at all but the bottom line alongside of Kaitlyn in the karma is real too even though we don't see him we could see them and it's still like the band even though you might not have seen it I think Nautilus is like really likely to approve really enough week more aggressive jungle from dardoch no more good I like that gameLily of course going to have plenty of early aggression there as well let me know that set is mid tops waxed and then only just hasn't been that effective in the ALCS he will think good at getting leads on it but I really struggled I think tattoo kind of clothes out with this Champion so it will be interesting to see if Doc is going to be able to do that you know I do think that he he he's going to be someone who can actually compete against this Graves and who wants to be able to come run over the map and Empower far Billy can keep up as far as the clear speed ghost but overall you know what's 2 + 6 in the LCS or hasn't hasn't been very impressive Labyrinth contract are the two that have a win here. On his first play of the split on this Natalie and I think more junglers are kind of reaching to try to bring out the ditional Harry Styles Tumblr pic we stop first did Ali Pick 4 lottery this week now. Going to hit barta's as the pick your mix I think what a lot of guns Stephanie not nearly strong the lehner as something like Toonami but it gives you a lot of engage options it gives you theNational utility here and it is going to be someone who can really be effective at picking off especially someone like the karma is relatively low mobility and it's going to be relying on that flash to actually escaped from the ultimate I can't allow you to set up pretty effectively and the BART alt into a trap combo is very very affected that's something that's going to allow them to really find a lot of pic but then we threw out the Met game about visiting for the first time since week one where somebody played back-to-back Orange games are what is like you have some day and you're giving him or what are you doing in your draft this time around they have a chance we know to Havelock class again they have control the destiny in order to get themselves into the upper bracket of plastic is a very big deal that you're absolutely fighting for and it's a you know what did working Week 1 but it's 2 months later we think you're at the guitars that blind pick or an is the way to go if I forgot kind of pecanand I'm curious to see if it's a hundred thieves have level up enough to say well somebody on tanks is doing to work for us for a forecast first time I think that was the concern right at that he had the blind pick so you know maybe nervous about some of the pics I buy Pro be willing to bring out you know a lot of people are are kind of assuming that this could be a top Focus game plan because it does seem like a mismatch and Nails has talked about it and we were talking about in the cap to check in Novi for going for some sort of a counter pick in and getting StarTalk options to actually play through that lane so if you are expecting that and it's pretty risky like blind pick a carry on the stair I do think that somebody should be able to withstand is Camille matchup you know Camille obviously with jungle help can get a head but it's difficult for her to really just completely Snowball the way because Orin has sold wave beer and for the most part even from behind can kind of just if get the tower and defend the real question though is you know Ken the rest of the team pick up the slack as far as damage is concerned and can they be those that wincondition but I mean somebody's going to have grade engage there's lots of squishy members Pumas going to have good engage with the ultimate and Cody sun has been a reliable carry plus you have contract on the grade so they're not lacking for damaged by any means courtesy set men here again as well and we'll see what can happen now is it good to us once again feels you just joining us back's against the wall dignitas must-win here for a chance at playoffs or they are gone there season is over and we will wait for 20 21 to see the guitars play League of Legends ever again someday in Viper top side grass provider will make him a stronger will hurt his dueling again someday later on with flip Force going to be slightly weaker but honestly from my experience as not like we talk later if gold that your items when you the match up the runes are less of the factory rep you know 35 minutes but obviously can be relevant matter I think honestly I concur it like matters more and more likely to have the extended trade and competitive play let's be honest Almost 100% of time before and it's just going to stand at the chart not even interact with you once you're at the point where you can actually win the fight so no grass for the part where you actually are writing a lot is incredibly effective that pussy Camille passive makes a lane you're so much more effective here for Viper so if you can get ahead if you can get that gold eyes are saying you're kind of hoping that you can get strong enough to where you can kind of just put in and try to ignore the orange try to take our plates or at least be able to have priority so they can roam around and you know threatened the enemy jungler threat midliner and things like that about that one and just step out the way because Health Partners in spot trades against some rocks as well so very very small early start there. I couldn't bear for his own jungle three camps in right now taking a flu buff down no problem get this. By the way for the Lee actually is worth staff as well but if they do aggressively word against you no feeling comfortable enough there so far early farmaleaf Italy as expected of the Seas mechanic very very strong baby the jungle are most liked most tied your mechanics than any of the jugular I can definitely see that I think I think that's pretty fair to say you know some other ones that are live with more complexity Lilia I think it's like fairly complex now but maybe not had a pro-level you do for pro players in the expectation that they cannot get the all kite the camps perfectly and whatnot I could definitely see Emily being in the most difficult in that regard remember they were actually playing pretty well again, I know that was a fairly winnable game they did end up falling down a but they had a respectable showing in Phoenix was actually going for a full tank set you knows it wasn't set with back-to-back I do think that again it would make sense here for him to go full tank and he's really the only true Frontline Iran the team they have a lot of damage from grass the squad with the in a pretty much pure damage top laner and, as well as I need to leave here to do me adding in some extra damage there so I would like to see him just go full tank again and try to play as at 4 I think there is a lot of damage and I really do think you can get all the way through. Going again for the rest of us because we take so much for the Viper but it still might be this graph is taken away sleeping around the killing of War going to get even more AP from those zombie worth coming through that's going to feel great for him to question is we going to get stopped and really no contracts going the other side of the map he might take wolves he's got wrap this up for himself and he's not fitting that gramp they can't post Away by Darla Pursley as contract until you see if I put you on back in the Top Lane you don't even have an opportunity to go over there because then you just be flipping a coin because you don't know if he's actually sitting in the blue buff brush in a waiting for you and then you can get hookshot over on you and it'll be pretty easy kill so contract had to be more defensive from that situation someday or if the Flash no Viper is back up to the top right now but trouble he'll be just enough but now go get some hot cocoa Ralph Lewis Johnson has massive Ford Viper now in a little bit trouble will be able to back it up but if you go to work the bar to do gay that extra utility but you don't have that straight up leaning prowess that a champion like, can and you can see Cody's have been poked out quite a lot here no app remove zoning am off of this second Coco there and then prove your stuff's too far forward and get chained up and once you actually get that full roof it's pretty easy for Johnson to land a lot of those Gill shots and just straight-up chasing down Cody Sun year they have absolutely everything there really well play by David Tatton who would have needed to hug what do you know towards that little alcove you can actually see through that wall so if you actually move down you got tether you could actually you over the wall and break that tether immediately and then I think you do survive to me that shows a little bit of inexperienced actually on the Bard PICC and it made us something he didn't even think about that because a lot of really great Bard players will utilize The Alcove for magic Journeys to actually you'll be able to escape some situations like that at me to cut a function have arcade shift yourself away though take the nice little time to put it does not matter it means when a fuse get temporary control over the bottom River butt and the day. I feel bad about that one cancel the contract. Part feels good to run to first Blood. Augustine tickets at 7:16 or gold lead also very interesting I don't think I've ever seen, I noticed that bends that's really strange that I'm kind of wondering you know what exactly is thought process is there cuz I I don't think Natalie will really be able to effectively keep that stacked up yes in in all in that situation do if your ears are you jumping can you use all the all the abilities in in cat form then you are going to able to stack it up fairly quickly but it's not as though you then stay there and keep it does not really how I buy to work for her so I'm curious if this is intentional or or maybe a nice pic but difficult and pick rate and went right or both exceptionally low for Concord so it could be pushed Champion but this this almost feels more like it would be around because if you know where I can see it yeah yeah I play but I'll just be like 15 or we can ask about it we can do one better than me but we have a flight now again and it's damaged on the Phoenix without one Dead Rising 2 words probably probably full tank I think it is is smart here you probably not going to make or break the game either way it is something's will have to track you see how it doesn't go through. It could even potentially be in a more about looks of the secondary choices he wants you know he does have zombie Words the movie with you if you want that plus presence of mind but I still don't really understand it cuz you could just go secondary either way we'll see how this does work out for it, but things looking pretty good for digging cost in the early stages soon as they are winning Lanes across the board yet or is just about that even your volume button Jocelyn have the killed or updated form of the top laner up form jungle to upload the farm Midland so and look pretty happy about that me of things hate mid laner left lane
star-studded Squad yes you can say hey some of this is the Champions he's taking a lot of Champions in action here I'm excited to see how he developed as a player he does seem to have been of that Killer Instinct he's not afraid to go aggressive try to make things happen sometimes it has bit him in the butt in some of their losses but overall I think he is been a really impressive player and I had a lot of fun watching him throughout his and you're in the elsya have a lot of fun to do it again key or Bortles of course are on the outside of class looking in right now the playoff bar is 5 wins Immortal do not have it would have the easiest remaining schedule in the LCS it's honestly one expected to be as well and visit us in Evil Geniuswhen's put Immortals can still catch CLG they can stay ahead of the guitar second look for winds like this I want to see if they can make that pussy if it's possible we had a long talk yesterday saying look I'm glad of an LCS player again I want to be a playoff play with you to make that would happen next and pick up right away in June as an excuse. See a lot of Iowa right now in the lead in the ALCS. And I'm pretty confident about that we can get confirmation but I'm from the first one we have got to see something that is definitely not as much as some of these other pics but I really want to see what the pairing is going to be if they have something specific in mind Jaco known for his thrash known for as Morgana maybe they want to go something like that type of Route you could even go get more of an aggressive option than being out the Morgana which is been paired very frequently with the Caitlin but double Marksman and syndra picked up here for hundreds of used as you said you know theyeasier to schedule remaining but they have lost for their last five games so they need to shape up and need to be playing clean down the stretch if they want to maintain their playoff position because they are just one game ahead of a mortal's right now they're on the cusp there too so if you drop this game Immortals has the ability to move up in time with you and be happy gonna to be a hundred thieves codes weeknight is Team Liquid flyquest who are arguably the two hottest teams in the league right now at least two of the three hottest so if you're going to win if you're going to get to five. These are your best chance to do so and that would be a team that you are you know been fighting gave me a tiebreaker or such poor as well so if Mortals if you're going to do it you're probably doing it today insanity is on damage yet again his third Zoe game of the split the set an alarm in 50 into the fair even about talk about down there as well so only a possibility alarms getting the girl got respect then coming through stuffyeah I am going to expect this to be Top Lane set but it could be us on it it is getting more popular is a pretty tough matchup that being said we do see some junglers feeling comfortable to just try to play it offensively just expected I can't say I was expecting the voice crack band who has not brought it out yet we have situationally seen it but it can be difficult for Jen to deal with because Jen does not have any way to dodge out on it but fruit pretty interesting I think it's for spices for pick because I'm confused with a draft order right of the day guy is just not that surprising or special either so bored I get right but yeah. I'm not sure if you needed it for thatlet's hear they are with with some occasions for all that they certainly have really slow but it's anyway maybe something you can certainly get another tank down there in the import regardless so yeah we're still looking at zero takes two peas and support tanks Alistair or Leona aren't that tank it's also possible they could put the setup stop playing for a Laura mango something in a little bit higher damage in the jungle from a really wanted us there are ways to get more damage in the composition you also could you know how vire damaged top liner to match up here at your work is actually pretty good into Gangplank I'm not sure if we'll see it Allure Amanda Morrison General have been one of the teams in the past that have been willing to try something more out there pick some kind of crazier things it could be awkward trolling us a bit with this hover Sion will come out so I meanyou have a decent early Ladyface you're not expected to dominate the GP though and then Sunday is such a strong player that he should be able to have a relatively free Lane I do think that their opposition here is very low on damaged you have heavy amounts of Cece and there are squishy members so she can get to those squishy members you have the ability to lock them down and bursting out in a with with some of the damage here no warmth we have some signs of the path you can do things like Titanic Hydra or sometimes even stairs get a little bit more damage in there so there is some options as long as far as that goes but I feel like when you play these has the cops if you do not absolutely nail you're engaged you are going to get kind of doubt you were going to get slammed because you're back line will not be able to keep up with their back line and your tanks are going to be kind of caught in this middle is worth like a phase rest in a phase Rush Graves GP is is hitting Barrel chains on your tanks and your front line is just getting slammed so it's all on the engage in that case they have to have the purpleturn off the great novel is all coming across the locking down those members and then if you can lock down that grows lockdown that's injury could burst them out and try to win that fight all right take one is a bit small for a hundred things that got a gang flick of the topping for Sunday and Immortals get the first gen of the LCS splitted means marks against a line Bingo because Zoe got picked today so congratulations bark you got another Point here as we got some CeCe in the bottle let him is just going to recall any way like you're patting the stats and nothing is really getting games here. Like you're getting spell peace on Earth but you know what I'll take spoke with you can get it and I actually disagree with you a little bit what they do yet is they push him back and then they can walk in safely Vision right if mom catches is high on health then I do think there's a little bit more risk to actually walking in on this in Fade Out some cash. Have a pretty strong level one so I think there's a little bit there but I agree overall it's it's not going to amount to much and they didn't end up being even dropping any Awards this yearBrendan so it doesn't matter though you don't know because I got removed for years ago the like little vision that happens if you drop a war that you have an animation you can tell when someone were to brush that's gone so I probably could have pretended to Ward and Smith he's going to go ahead and knock this thing down give the last it to Insanity they're going to share XP alarm I believe out of range of that one but on the Scion statistically very very good matchup into Gangplank has a really I went right in that matchup overall nothing from Wayne County for the game cuz to work out well for you so we'll see if that comes through at some point but if it's important you actually do have pretty good time in the early phase that you have the ability to actually push the GP you have to be really careful by the passage UPS on level 1 start from Laura much are not sure if that is almost to be honest with you I don't really play a lot of Zion myself but going w e doesn't have any ability to fight back and he's actually just getting dude on cooldown plus the trial by fire is very dangerousdevil to Smite fight gear potentially Immortal is roaming office it was a hundred fuse bottom Lane and it's Andy's coming down to it's enough to keep you safe so very interesting jungle pathing contracts going to read the enemy blue Drake write his own blue is there in time to defend it that's I mean very adamant that it happened this way end of the day contract code for the risk and it's not rewarded and this is actually the Flash and someday we'll break his shield and he's got to be careful that second barely hit them alarms at 200 house already flashlight that someday is Relentless in that link alarm only has two Cs and we have to go that way but the way it didn't look like it was very good for a hot-air and you can't really base not too far if you could be the way it is absolutely screws pushing away from he has gotten a fair bit of Health back but I mean if your Sunday you just hold this wave let it come to you you don't need to do anything aggressive he has traveled far is sonow you got the three Cs and you don't know where Graves is here in Gray's in your try for us because they all leave one of three CS at least afford a refillable potion all right and a control board for the Braves game he is comparison a fine nothing could possibly go better hear true Viking use for power Spike late is great now and I'm honestly so maybe there was some texture them's not heard any with the w but it's such a long cool down it at level one and you can't really fight back and then like I guess it's a process if you use it to absorb some folk but it's a shield breaks you can't actually pop it for a turn damage so I feel like the Q is just better but I don't know maybe I'm missing something in some 10 million Master Point Zion can let me know exactly what the fuk brought us here is either way somebody play feeling very well you did really good use of the trial by fire passes at 3image burn constantly. That every time he did actually kill the barrel off every Stitch or passive and he is much more difficult or I'm going to leave early learning phase goes for GP tomorrow put these going to get that Gene and towards the Triforce reach can't pressure him anymore okay to head down to the bottom of the Mack you going to go through and look at that and it's not about to go through the body no fold forward Cody sun it's a flash down no gang it also seems like he said he wasn't going for the gank right as soon as the super saw the work he started killing the war and how cool is flashing forward if you're going to actually go for that flashing gate I feel like she needs to be continuing to move forward so that if there is that the power from Tom kench you can actually clapping back in slowing down chilling like find some sort of ability to catch up then it just seemed like there was not on the same page. I'm just as well you ain't heard me but I don't really have to care about this one he's chucked a potion of Isis Farm is fine he's got more minutes to kill for the Post reports if you wants it to an end of the day does Caitlin is having a nice easy time here in is Laney face firming up nicely but now that you won't respond to it yet again contract and Dick Smith you can keep doing that around his mother anger comes in but again to save them can you describe a better on that happened to honorhealth on Dorsett is pushed all the way out of the river all the way out of the Jungle has no help build up right now he has his feelings might there's no way you're going to actually win that fight against Rays who had the challenging Smite which is so much better for the dueling plus just the ability to pay you out shrimp Rock the phase Rush on butts with quick draw crazy able to create that space and now we'll just be able to start off this Dragon probably going to need some help though is that you can take quite a bit of damage doing this by yourself but for a heel and have a honey fruit but I'm fairly low going to finally walk over to have a chance to go get her to shut the way things used to be safe today contracted to damage these feeling good about picking the early aggressor in the don't go back to take the dueling lead and feels good as Santa to get the same as in a Roma mid lane. Close but small Leach Wyoming overall in the early game as Top Lane is still double CS 5226 stop playing is Boom so I don't think he's feeling really good about their chances in this game has been such a big wind condition 450 used in early so go someday so goes Hunter to use it often feels like he is really good at snowballing advantages and actually making that count big time so we will see what they want to do as far as a playing this they don't have really any engage that's one of the things kind of working against other thieves so it's it's not as though they can just like set up bought it and die very easily with beauty also I do think that the idea here is just going to be trying to Play 4 winning Lanes try to snowball through Jack is in a force your opponents to come to you at those usual ejected do you have to drag and things like that and that is how a hundred things are going to find their fights where they can then try to cut it out and then slowly kill off of Mortals in a bit low on man has a straight back and forth with them day has as well as could have backed by alarms cute weights around Macon Xpress W Inn Express q and get the occasional CS barrel change. Looking to land there you can see 60 ACS now highest-end is feel bad for alarm take him imagines he wanted to getting outplayed it so far and I think he picked it more for their cough rather than the match up in a sign and I don't think he's making sound but either way it went really bad for him and they're cheating by coming in here very early and you're not expecting to be able to come up here and there in the early levels but some day has been able to win the trade season of the get the farm. A great lie here does have ultimate so be careful but it could be a fight here as CIA as well but now he has to worry about open back with it will flash of a lot of stay alive from day does The Rustic 3lc all line up the grab the killed Pac West Runaway he's going to care for a while ago said summer he'll keep that man safe enough that is hundred thieves on the four for the kill the first break but at least the herald lunch was missing that was really well done but after the GPS
thank you very much Gabby and we are in a Champion Select Evil Geniuses and flyquest doing battle to see what else can happen EG trying to get closer closer to securing and upper bracket spot in the playoffs they can still be caught right now flyquest right now game and a half behind second-place that cloud 9 GSM club or just up at 11 winds like go to the 10-year themselves and the next when they've got EZ match of expecting them to reach out we have two 12in 6 will see the power bugle wow a lot of focused for the power of evil in a lot of respect to how well he has been playing and santorin talks a lot about how how are you evil and he know their job is often to to withstand the early game because he tends to pick for scaling pics to go more towards his King fighting style and as a result they feel like they're winning the game if they can go even they feel like they're winthe game is like they can it withstand the pressure than their opponents and this time she is definitely trying to hold down power of Evil 3 mid lane dance to wear them first pick Stendra so goldenglue tried to push power of evil out of his comfort zone with those three Band Away plus the listen to actually taken and there's not a lot of pics that party was actually shown still alive throughout the rest of the split is it Casio Corky and Catherine all have one play a Diana would be interesting this is considered a syndra counter in the 1D one and we did actually see him bring it out in the past I don't think he had a lot of success with it I believe you played it in the spring but not going to get locked in just yet not just yet I think yeah you can maybe wait till 3 to pick on right side of a couple of the other campaigns right here that will be in your kind of locked out of some kind of stuff going on board shows up you really want Karma or you're not probably would have not Lain very easily know that we just saw a class with that lame-ass, Force very very strong but not going towards still really only plays to Champion he wants to play as real or a family of every single time if you can Ash is gone a Fella's got nerve so he's on his real 3D I think this kind of concern though it is long term that is going to hurry G if if if your phone has been since he always get of winning match up in the bottom line because you're as real NFL use both have been kind of bird by that buy a lot of the other Champions Boston by refusing to nurse them selves so you would expect it to be pretty bad Lane for him on that bottom side and it really double stolen pics here for EG with what we suspect is a jungle pick up for the set we're probably going to see that in the jungle obviously solo does a plate quite a bit of set himself but is not going to be able to have parody of a picture of the could go towards midlane answer if you do that though you know if there is the ability for them to still Target and potentially Santorum instead of pushing down further process fighter write the man has a ton of games for example if you're looking for those but okay we know where can I buy Quest We Know Pua is important we're going to destroy the entire control make you really really want him on rumble or it'll all make sense but it means I feel like we should be poised to find some very severe counter picks and try to really take over those lengths if not in a winning one to imagine that out scaled the games if you can't punish me I'm going to get you know it'll aching free the only thing is though because that's holding his word actually do the counter fixes that didn't come through already for fly bites you can just throw more bands for the tollway right so it's just like 5 Bit Lane band can you really get that like super sick counterpick to slam Lane I don't know right you know what we'll have to see how deep are evil is capable does go have faxed he is the re ending band is nothing we seen him play in a long time I did mention the Diana that got offered it I double checked it was late one time and spring in a while so he still has that but it is such a different play style you're not just for him but for the whole theme I wouldn't be surprised if you just go to work on because that's kind of what they play all the time for a narc he does have a lot of different Champions played but we're gone is six games Pantone the next most played at 3 and then it's a bunch of candies with one play we've also seen him play the record alongside the Ezreal quite a bit is a losing Lane but it is more about how effective ignorant to find a good angle of device is buff backups if you want to go for the UPS real I mean that's possible to EG side right of course we're flyquest I am in to see what happens write the check and I feel like going to live so just goes to the fairly safe and easy Corky here on power of evil that's going to feel pretty solid you can easily go early hexdrinker and Spa the match up and then just go pretty well it came extinct cuz it was all worth for McLane dance you just put them on Courtney does that feel like it accomplish anything I feel I feel like this is kind of something that's how you know he is pretty plain these types of backups and they want to go with that model has the ability try to go in I think is quite effective against bi2 doesn't have any any part of that or anything like this will find out is the solo playing at top or it's in Torrington explain that to Jungle and they both have a lot of place on it you know second tied for the most played for Solo in toppling is the most played for stand for in the jungle so it could be going either way frontal coming through means that should be a top flame set pretty pretty nice into the Volver and if someone is going to be the building full tank that you can Alton and make yourself a lot more janky on I also knew decent ability to do try to gank of these Lanes specially, Mike the rumble of rock was pushing can be susceptible to Eternal gang generally speaking Center is not very susceptible to such a long soak before key because you're expecting phase Rush the gates a lot of the game Power gear from the trundle but pretty pretty interesting matchups that mean I do think that that flyquest Ave of the wind bottom Lane I think a lot of it is just going to come down to Kenny G actually getting it into her later on and it's just a matter of 10 gold will establish enough of an advantage here to kind of make this draft work while cuz you first pick Sandra and you put four or five bands on Midland yeah you're really hoping that that's going to work out for you when all of your drop priority entirely was placed in the Middle Lane on the go to Blue here standing in the Midland sign just couple weeks ago he's only got six game on EG this year right like they're going to hope this can be what they need for this one they got who neon ultimate Comfort here as well with the rumble they saw set already picked that that's fine I'm okay with the matchup statistically a little bit set favor. Horrible's do certain that we see from Hootie is will mid-game team fights come around and he puts out 7 million damage in the team fight is one that the teapot damage of what is there syndra Trumbull Azrael isn't Frontline that can certainly work on the EEG site for the flag beside as you can imagine and write well you got to ask corki the backlight is great you're ready to go on that one pressure give you a safe this can look really good for either side like I have been hotter as well EGR on a two-game losing streak like when they have won their last three they're looking pretty solid and they're just right behind that play if I spotted well it's also worth noting that despite the fact that he actually has play Rumble in the LCS the split it was his most successful champion in Academy while he was down there he is 75% win rate over a yes just for games but he was actually crushing it on the rumble obviously you know it's kind of been to known Pixies days is GP in Rumble those are the two that I think people have have the most faith in him on so we'll see how we can do again solo I do think so loved those is very stalwart and toppling the he's one of the top laners I think I value very highly because he's so good at playing without having a lot of attention sometimes they will play for them to try to get him an advantage but he can withstand it a lot of pressure can withstand play weak side and it is not usually someone who gives up a big lead to his opponent switch make make who needs Java a Larder player overall I think so low as it is very very least I think this guy in fight for number 1 on a good day I'll just get some lames up there at the top of them but I really think so is phenomenal and in this game I think solos been having a better year than the overall I think the favourite expecting good things out of Solo in this game even without a lot of jungle pressure overall I think they look pretty solid I'm a big fan of half life has been doing I think they are looking really really sharp it's kind of funny cuz the more I'm like okay I'm really really leave The Blacklist down baby your number 3 Wii CT Aceves biking up really hard as well and and they're also really impressive maybe build things better than Cloud 9 now and it happened I was like well actually are good quality receiving at a fly Quest based on what I've been seeing over the last six games the LCS flyquest or a world caliber team based on what I'm seeing flashes are going to world what happened I don't know right you got to get top free this summer split flap we do they're going to playoffs we do EGR going to playoffs he seems like he's fighting each other in the first round the flag must look at the team that will make up for it just getting so much more interesting for me though it don't like early on the earth like yeah okay well we're going to play some cod I know when and how does that mean Cloud 9 is number 4 in and who knows right they might just completely bounce back and still crush it in playoffs but you also earlier we're talking about guarding probably quality of the top 14 so if you have them up they're Wireless up their new TSM liquid you know 59 all these teams are having the potential or putting in performances at 2 to really be able to kind of justify themselves as potentially being mean to one of those 10 seconds can be a threat in playoffs right in a golden Guardian some people may scoff at that but no 83 in your last 11 games is very impressive and no Cloud 9 is the one of all of that Bunch that start with the most in the second half life are so despite the fact that there are the sprinklers Champions a Domino's in Spring a lot of these teams are are within Striking Distance it's feeling like now in flyquest is definitely one of those Squad 2 on their best day ever really been looked very good absolutely agree fly plus could look great today and we'll see you then get around the map is it going to be a small Leash from solo Sports and turn on the red similarly the dueling leashes fence Care on his rent often we have similar it starts over raw as you mentioned that one should look pretty solid overall as they're going for their early start on this one so then what are you going to write blows back and forth conqueror not a big surprise there punch them a couple of times it takes the better half. Dre I'll also say this is could be potentially a pretty tough game for wild turtle come see if I time I do think that ignore may have to play more defensively then fresh normally would simply because Nautilus Plus Mobile on to the Ashley's head very difficult to deal with you also have a lot of damage that can actually reach the back line such as Azrael all scatter the week even Volver jumping in there if there is a lot of diaphoretic all throughout turtle and I think that is what you do is going to try to do to try to get on top of that shock you knock him down so he needs to make sure that if that's the case he's in a good position to actually defend is Marksman there with the lantern is level 3 in can play on top of me wants to cause you no trundle doesn't tend to take chickens in his first clear if I'm going to try to steal those away I'm always a really really big fan of top-level players who all he knows is okay set least top price that's what I believe was through fog of War hot shot of course I spent that are on blue and pink is happening at I want to go to is losing farm right now the midline we was dying without him and that means he is down golden X beats he is going away from his land right now is go without being fought over who needs the help go to Blue takes away a Scuttle crab and pasta right back over the fence drones over the water fighting over dick knocked out power of evil as well what a chaotic early game is now it's been towards time to run away or it going to be able to get out of there they just barely couldn't kill Spence carrot ignore had this room that honestly looks like it it's already paid off that the pillar was easily escape room by goldlink because he has favored us with that they say all right we just want to fully turn him off so make him walk the whole long way around while he's losing Farm but ignores only level two and they decide actually for this so you know once they've fully committed to this let me listen to finish a romantic was great you set up a freeze for power he will you don't need to go for more look we're Goldblum if you just pulley freeze this then you're in a great spot instead they give up the freeze it's actually mean he's dying to the turret now they are hard to get you onto since Karen and it looks like they were going to be able to make it work but the Triumph you'll start coming through because they first down this level to know Shockwave that are sorry no aftershocks rash I was incredibly squishy so try it feels are coming through on Cynthia Aaron Kuni Rome's down and it all the sudden got turned around so badly on flyquest because honestly it's just feel like they got a big greasy I think you just freeze that way you have gold Blue Zone away your winning this this matchup that EG drafted entirely for and you can just be happy with that you out scale you don't need to do anything too crazy yeah I mean like what he sees the Oculus xol triple jump from Golden to the gasket wreck but yeah and the Daybreak clearly the aggression was punished clearly it wasn't over step well played the EG you deserve coming to head of that one that's okay to The Underdogs right now that they are seven and eight day roster swaps at 5 and 5 and the new roster is two and three right now in the lineup look at the baby go through and through with this group basement active currently beating Blacklist beer bottle and you can see the smallest to Farley's to bang it's going to be plus one then less they can have dropped this farm with nothing to contest it and it has a sister is backed by Questlove if they are a thousand go behind off at play obviously going to be regretting it a bit but they still have double call on their Market
very worrying trend for Cloud 9 is that I cute into a random Nexus was game with Licorice and Vulcan and they were unable to carry me you know how so I was pretty heavy to be fair that game but no wearing very worried indeed they can do it I want to see some pop office but I would like to see it again aggressive. Speakers full of Courts Olaf Remains the most important fan against Cloud 9 10 jongleur can fly ever find something else that I wanted to touch on quickly with the jungle pool here is that why burritos is getting a lot better get them so much actually been over 73% of the time again five 9 and that is includingReese first games of this place where you got to play it back to back to back so bad every single game you know there's not as many carry options for him to go to as there are for a lot of the other junk was the end of the week and I think you know when people are talking about the fact that the Irish always liked Ares you shouldn't be on trundle yesterday can consideration that most popular junglers that are carried style he hasn't played and whether that's he's not comfortable doesn't like playing with that first aisle is it another question to answer but I do think that cloud nine it is very easy to pinch the jungle pool and push flower off of a more of a jerk Harry Styles and as a result she knows they're they're having some time to show up on on the status of the trundles and and the day for us and things like this when it gets what they would want to he's been able to flyimage of the three Olaf pics it's been unbanned once since then and I was taken away is the first pic when they're on red side so yeah it has been delivered. Fayetteville a person to be more and more mostly a jongleur from what I've seen and pearl flake Caitlin by the way I think is most important in League of Legends right now I think she has the strongest Slater in League of Legends I think Jeff has advocated match up into a switch benign Rush pick up to receive as a rock but I really like Caitlin in the bathtub Morgana he was going to make TSM I mean things should be just like to just flip down plates like a pot trick to this fall it 10 minutes this game based on just can't be something right now. I make here that's just happened right now you go to work the pope support and be okay to work on his right arm affect exactly what I was going to say don't agree I do think if they if they went to Ward you know like a minute later or something and then piece of workreally good in to CC Champions at Hardin Gates Champions where they're easy to block of the black field jacket can't really struggling to Polk South Champions like Karma even pretty problematic yes, is in danger if you do ever get trapped up because you are Squishy in the end of finding into the Trap it's probably going to be death but in a straight have to be to wear Vulcan inventor not getting hit by binding they should have the winning lash-up I do feel now, plus Ash has incredibly strong push you can utilize the queue on the back line from the karma Diwali as well as going to help you know maintain but then the Caitlin is pushed back under fur turret and being poked out that could be a difficult situation so I like that answer here from Cloud 9 vs theoretically this still could be a soul in, but I am going to assume it is for the to be too and I think the TSM is doing the same thing here bending towards midline Cloud 9 also the targeting beards in here with a little bump in it does happen in the first game of the split so far in summeragree to point though I think the addition of, turn that mess around a fair bit I think we should see a lot of pressure down here in the bottom side right set and Volver have decent control we're seeing a lot of explosive Midland band skier as well you see Cloud I'm trying to get rid of some of Dirksen carries right live long and Silas off the table TSM didn't know what this key style is galios wouldn't be that surprising either it wouldn't I'm I'm wondering about the silence band at the if that's you know about 9 saying that they want to actually go towards something even liked malphite there are some of those those texts that could be devastating to have the ultimate stolen away your silence is not kind of generically popular these days a lot but he hasn't actually brought it out you know no one on PSN without you play Styles have to split so this is something or a nod to a specific counter they are trying to avoid Kenan also you know that would be a pretty devastating all to steal and it does seem like they are going to save last pick your for mid lane to try to interfere is actually available that could just go back to it if you're going to have I think it's absolutely Immaculate game on the zillion in their last game if he was incredible and it was paired alongside with Kayla I don't really see any any reason why you can't go towards a zillion it would be blind there are some a cup you have to be a little bit worried about but generally speaking once you get past the early levels on billion you are very comfortable in pretty much anything irelia interesting so this could be made or top we don't we don't know just yet it is a flex pack and they might want to go double Flex we used to do this a lot in the past I couldn't you know call is Allison what type of things were very meta people go double flex-o-lators and then just adjust bass on the matchup I don't think that you would want to be playing ghirelli into the canyon so I am expecting that to be can a baby see if it would be Top Lane a r l e n e will get you out of opting into that so very interesting stuff you're right I do think that broke or the Westside Lanes a peacock I think would be fine I want you again have some bubbles in your ear especially when you hit sick to Wayfair becomes a very good it does make it more about the Tea fighter and the Poke and they would maybe struggle to answer and so I could go with something else where is not profly broken plate of licorice or better than a few more than average in Kenner loses more than average against you know the field compared to this doctor so this should look at least according to the Houston have a great wife Elaine Morgana you're pushing a tenant good luck with that once he is going to make you dye it a little bit late for my taste in that can be difficult if you get behind and gold otherwise you're getting free fired on you get dark binded by Morgana and you're probably just dead before that thing drops is Ash throws damaging to you the same time though you got to close a team fighting on the other side right Cloud 9 disc look really really nice with the fact that pain in flank we just saw them his manhood entire game announcer isn't has an incredible amount of seats has lots of set up for the healing trap steel Gold Card binding even earliest honor or the set class from Les Mis on there potentially Kent trap out of that I will stay even if it is or irelia you having the ability to win that later on of microcephaly of Kevin is is that Kenan no winds pretty much all these ranged vs. melee matchups at least for the first early levels that you are going to have pushed I do think that Post 6 a really has potential to all in the cannon and where I can get more dangerous but you know there are answers there are ways for 9 to even deal with the TF and I think one of those is Kenya's year have the push right and if is your can actually keep drinks in a locked and returned it since he can consistently put it in you know we did see that there was that nerve on TFW obviously it's going to be a logger cool now which means you are going to push a little bit more slowly have less access the blue cards refill the man of the red cards push it out that's something where they could get an advantage of his ear has him locked if it's who we do is going well for the Vulcan and they can push with impunity because TF is stuck under store it then things can start to get tough thing for TSM little play hear the Cloud 9 did licorice comes down to be in range for Vortex P I believe in Fulton III Championship are you get level 2 off of the first wave of the Soul enter the bladder reveals it get last hit and liquor shops to the weeks that one awake in a little bit here to see the jugglers do is start their respective redbus TSM doublelift treats want to go right away into attacking this again bottling is really really volatile go to get to push has a really big lead in that one top link removal tool as well as you're saying Kevin probably feels comfortable in the dirty as time goes on that can flip when he becomes a reality be 12 years and having to play really far back but the fact that Miss Kika right here, you can see Volcan is going, as well they're indexing more highly to Wards Lane phase through this is not are you this is not Guardian this is no, going for, here and then trying to play just lay there going to have pushed they're going to look to pressure I wouldn't think that's also very nice about the lethal Tempo is that you hit them with the volume Proctor Eagle Temple and then you can use all that bonus attack speed to actually constantly shoving that way if he even more heavily and you can see as a result SS already missed three minions know when you are getting pushed in Non-Stop by this, by the sash it can be difficult at some of these minions are always going to come to the turret the right Mount of help and you can see the trailer back and forth Vulcan puts on The Shield is okay let's go hit you a little bit deals new it back and forth for us we are Relic Shield here despite this healthy stuff in the previous patch and I do think spell cease would have been viable in this game but with housing that's playing laying out that you're still going for the safer options on both sides and the guaranteed building coming to rebuild in case things go wrong I do think it's a good point because specifically when you are playing this title match up with your plate,, if you don't have the Mana regen you are actually going to run out of me that you're not going to be able to rescue on the cool down the whole time he's really aggressive betray you know we saw he use the key for the speed up Shield himself to try to dodge a binding and then you can go in for some of those Auto attacks spell tease would give you a lot more mineral gen to be able to to kind of keep seeing you up that he has a higher risk High reward because you don't have the same amount of Health that you would have here with that Relic Shield and you also have to be consoling putting air of yourself at risk to go for those place but it looks like they're trying to poke it down how to set up a dive here if they could get more damage Down Yonder SS remember there's no huelen double if it's TP so there is potential to actually pull off a diet but they're not going to go for it they don't know exactly where the set is and haven't quite got SS or treats low enough to to Signal a dive and ultimately speak it as end up skipping his drugs to take stop Scuttle and then write you recall by for a minute to get back where you started up in your pants come back up for now that we think we can head towards the top side of cases of play licorice has to be respectful the fact that he is in a 1 b 2 before too terribly wants because around try to stay in fog I believe he got seen and so this is actually kind of awkward for him he doesn't work there but it is on a pink horrible so that's good early damage licorice down to about 1/2 HP already and Prince of Flash not sure he had two Broken Blade could you again but there was no extra son either way licorice is I don't want any part of this when I'm out blood work and fight for a ward I guess but and this is now a really difficult top light and the TV goes back in 57 say about yeah that was actually really really tough liquor to put in a pretty bad spot he was doing fairly well informed but because he just had a waiver to tonight from him you know it is going to be broken plate in the lead licorice you nor did not have the cover their from blabber set could have been in the area to look for title play with respect to that and as a result the wave got frozen I'm broke up with me sitting in a great spot to see all so forth the flash so now the anther wolfcamp was taken on the way down words but because of toppling pressure they at least the night wolves weight room plus me to lose the time recalls coming through now crossing a double for the black shield on. Sit down with a Q gets the route and doublelift is going to be hiding in the back and side do you have to go doran's shield on Caitlin of all things how aggressive is a scar Moline can be how to put the more defensive option find going to land from treats that eventually double Focus recall off should be able to four BS or does so indeed they're not too bad this is actually a really great if we try to force them to stay around because his younger is behind but either way it will go after questioning if that's not a marksman teleport to Steve behind him and because we're out of a manhattan-based you can actually go for that and it would be pretty devastating either way they're going to lose that beat the whole way because this is not a Canon wave recall has been no will as a result and we pretty much even on Farm they're going to take this time and said to go for plates they are going to go for that rag in and grab the first dragon hear for themselves so going in the paper of cloud nine year they did have a portion portal to recall and we'll have some nerve damage but Pretty good overall you know it's all right there what you just saw that is what TP buys you the entire way was lost from the event of both gold and experience + yellow + Douglas to also help with the right to make sure it's completely safe but no one's going to stop that that is what you get for burning teleport about 6 minutes and Elaine yes I still think C9 could have played that bottling slightly better and recall in front of Cannon it would have still lost the great but they would have left left golden experienced regardless is the state we are now and where the game is once again pretty much tied in Gold double once again very close on Farm overall and hate going to feel pretty good for the early game right now is that neither of us 69 Soul winners have there flat so we have to track can speak actually make anything happen in this next couple minutes a few minutes have passed since they did get burned but that's far not much has come from it but you can see them pushing doublelift back about a third of his help knocked down there but he still has three biscuits he's not really in much danger I would be surprised if she completed this recall I do think that's just that him kind of messing around a little bit. Because he has a lot of sustained with those three biscuits + is Orangefield and Fleet footwork you know this is a fairly defensive kind of survival install set up and you can see Bleiberg and moving up here with licorice make sure that he does
looks like we're going to playoffs it'll happen as well of course if we are in a battle between Havelock playoffs for themselves if they win here today they lock it upper bracket start and theoretically ezzell Golden Girls can finish as high as second in the regular split they can get a playoff bye it's almost impossible to get to go their way but it's possible CLG or just one game above the bubble they are tied for Seven 8 with dignitas and Immortal just one game behind them take a playoff spot away as they have had such a bad run over the last number of weeks honestly so no seal G's performance it if it is indicative of anything of these last few weeks and he started for and to write in there now sitting 5 and 10 so that is a pretty rough streaking a one-win eight losses over those last nine gamesgolden Guardian on the other hand is fixing to i-83 over their last 11 so they are actually looking at you no pretty pretty darn good definitely not refuse me but it's going to be a tough match for feels itchy and if they want to make it to the playoffs at all they've got to start picking up some wins yeah I've been took to put it in a very kind of aggressive weight the last time seal G1 Dave's what's playing in the Top Lane and they beat Evil Geniuses who promptly signed gold lipstick Advent start oplinger like that was what happened the last time steals you want a game the other team made roster changes because of the fact that that happened overall to call the Guardians here looking at a winning record right now they have yet to finish and elsya split with a positive win rate and I say that because I think this is the first iteration that I think can do it today are on the road to do 4th 10 and 8 would be that tour life their favorite here again CLG who got set locked in already and I want to find a big thing that I think does whole world Blind Guardian of falias was Nerf gunin the last patch here in 10-15. A lot of things have finally stopped picking the champion and it's FBI's how to split Israel also you know it's not as popular on this page and those two combined for 10 of his games and so he is going to be relying on those pretty heavily or at least he has been in the past we'll see where he wants to move also take me to make that they can even hire a CEO do you for the remaining games at visit flyquest and seen I so this is probably the most winnable Dame as you said they are only one game up on those bottom two teams so they want to maintain control over their playoff spot this may be their best chance to do so golden Guardians obviously trying to get towards those upper bracket game try to picture of that for themselves and has been looking very good maybe going back to the Affiliates regardless it hasn't been that popular down to about 25% presents I believe you were saying earlier and hasn't been super effective in those games but obviously still can be a monster in the lake ininto the can be so if you guys going to be on that yet again three and one on the affair Leo's going to be his most winning champions who said for this little to get up it's locked in here is golden Guardians have the set that we have seen who he play we do if we go topless show me the closest place to eat near as well and Demonte on another champion that got nerfed dispatch Twisted Fate was also a spot to Mid laner and Pro Player of the previous patch. Nerves a lot of teams the Bandit Montego says nope this is still the song I want to place it to work for me the cooldown got increase on the W's do at your pic of car does a Vibe lyrics to Second longer cooldown it's barely relevant do at Max rank if it's going to be the same but you know you're not maxing that skill first so it's not going to be till 12:13 that you actually do have that equal to where it was in the past but if you don't think that you're going to be bullied around the early game if you feel he can still maintain the pressure I do think that having that Global style semi Global style is something that golden Guardians have been very effective within the past it has been Champion that hasn't really really good for Demonte they want a lot of games rarely on playing this will push style weather looking for back doors and making trades of objectives in 2 hours and I think it's funny that they're going to be pretty interesting to know that this is the reverse of the match of that they were playing with the marked and roll cloud 9 it was then actually playing at the FL EOS and it was a golden Guardians who took the coolest and were able to really push the pace and actually snowball vacuum to Victory against about 9 so we'll see if FBI can have a better better better time in that matchup in entrapped hold Downs Dixon smoothie you haven't been strong later to be fair they haven't been but of course I'm active looks favorite for that you're seeing a pinch band or not convinced that the Ford is for sure going to happen obviously even if he does have a question and you could usually reactively black shield the facebreaker and you're going to look pretty okay so I like to see LG Duo statistically Golden Gardens wind that length mass of flies look filled your favorite near going to see more. I could use a bit later in the TF it does have a lot of lame pressure theoretically you could just got to push in obvious you can sell black fuel door light to Black lyrics cold hearted and can try to keep the mate under turmeric with the w nursing laning phase Nerf it would make that much a Fetter as though as the champion recently bought unless that rise go stop waiting for ruin it can have at East Meadow Lane pressure and feel good against Amante TF tell me some of the outside Lane again later on if you are thinking Golden Gardens going to really heavily depend on playing Thailand to having a champion that Ken Stillwell Angel a Kinderkamack side lansinoh be pretty effective in matching robes as well with their awesome work obviously not as good as the destiny but still can be fairly powerful it should be that Morgana down to the bot Lane drafting board here a little bit so much pressure in that to be to who he has been a great lame player of this does feel like it's more about the roaming no failures I don't think we'll ever really going to go down with that set because usually only seat that before I can repair the long side sometimes it up a steak dinner but also at the cliffs. So they are going to go with the rain support hear themselves but I do think we are due also ship them nurse should be pretty heavily disadvantage against the more, and close ties for sure going to have more Lane strength than that the Paleo so we'll see how much CLG can get done cuz I do think they are very heavily favored in the Scooby-Doo and it's going to be up to Golden Guardians on Elite survive but for who you to try to get out of Lane and try to force that Morgana to match his room so that FBI can kind of just before me and out against 6 day and CLG say Okay more Frontline for Caroline pobelter in 6/8 of the damage when it comes to Mid and late game the new can I was up in the top five they do with the match of was Ruth a pygmy maokai I'm ready to play tanks out of this one course or it was nervous patches while baby says this is now my CO2 tank either way this is going to be right here no more flop season things going to be coz looking favorite of the duo pobelter going to be an incredibly strong the late game damage Mage on the rise very curious to see how his matches going to go against the Monte if cleanse doesn't show up for the TF of course Rises pretty good gig setup might see Wiggly show up down there as well on the Boulevard and a very big Frontline right you got heavy tanks in the one side where is not quite so much that is pretty good over there on the jungle but it's not good email kaiv Boulevard and so Golden Gardens less with front line against the healthiest foods to fight do you think the milk I was honestly a great pic here it's it's my favorite tank into Kenan I do think that you can withstand that much of a very well and especially because you have another AP mid laner yes that is is damaging physical damage but he's giving building tank if it's a t f and a Canon so you can very comfortably Bill towards you know early Spirit message or at the very least you know a cow into a Sunfire you could hold up well in the sidelines Malachi has these waves lyrics if you do go for that Sunfire route and that the discussed snap go button is pretty powerful just flashed with Advanced be there very many squishy members over on the golden Guardian side so I think they're going to have a good time and you in those seems like I can also even be pretty difficult for Canon to actually find those engaged because even if tenant find the flank or a good angle to get two words that back line now if I can just say no lock you down with a Twist event into an ultimate into that huge knock you back even more so yeah they're still owe a lot of reasons why I really like this guy pic and I-10. field you pretty heavily if it comes down to keep fighting unless there is amazing and an ultimate but golden Guardians is going to want to be playing side blades still spreading the map out a utilizing Barton TF at the try to find these plays inside lanes and engages where are sealed she isn't quite ready for it and that's one thing we talked about a few weeks back when interviewing and asking you know hey what's your place. What's it look like for you and yeah you know we feel like we have kind of settled in on a play style we figured ourselves that we know what we want to do and it's a lot of this a lot of playing around the map and being one of those rotation heavy split push Focus teams in the league and so often I feel like we see a middle-of-the-pack or lower to your team and we're like all right look just refer team fight grab them Alki grab a nautilus Skyler filios go hit them v e v you know cuz you don't trust everything else golden Guardians have honestly has I would say is their best split ever so far as it to the others are getting better year of a year and it's it's but time and again they're going through these kinds of Champions they're playing more their own style they're they're doing their own little bit level of innovation and is it cool to see if it is working but it really isn't it interesting when you're talking about having the best butt ever I agree and it didn't even feels like it's even more like that this is our highest level ever when you consider how good they've been over the last number weeks because they started out one in for you know this was not a thing that came out of the gate so they are now sitting at 87th Ave been very good over the last to know about 5 weeks 4 weeks or so so I can be very happy about that it's also interesting to know that not only did who he start the wi for that you'll Shrine every time we've been seeing that people have actually been going to still lanes and dropping them there in this case they're kind of just having a bit of a nod towards their weak laning phase in this to V2 he actually started the W but dropped all of those help friends down in the bottom Lane in case they are getting pushed in case there are poked out they're going to have that they're going to have cleanses wild orange shield on that B I do very defensive set up the exhaust even on the bar which is pretty a typical so I do think that this is some pretty smart adjustment given that they are expected to to have trouble in this to be too early lead to push into food will get more Farm overall and actually just be some damage wisdom on Tazewell check through his potion Moser wedding around admit in case there is a game that have all of our for usually passed through May they're going to find some damage but certainly nothing like a gold card for a stunt both will be easily under threat and have no problems here will beat any small farm Leaf evolve Haunter putting it on the top side went through a cold start switch in a bun B one I'll be there was no risk at all you're never going to die 2 amount Hendersons really really miss play fun we had together so far though so good for Haunter pushing the wave has a small family and actually really like that closer just ran through laying there and he made the read that we lie was playing too that topside and since they had to push with wants her up on that top side you know that would always be a schedule that you would be able to get if they try to challenge me help them on tape you have to push up Midland you have to push you off so you could have caught you take the hospital and then he can Retreat down toward this bottoms go to the opposite side of the map from where weekly is and by doing this you guaranteed himself both schedules on this first rotation and that is going to be feeling very very good weekly can try to look for some sort of the gang Ciara but the Monte is playing at pretty far back is on so it doesn't look like there's going to be any opportunity to get something back here for Whately time of the day nothing really done but a 5c asleep or both are as the first three calls come through in the midline OR checking on botkier is well where there's a a Farley for FBI who he was taking you know the week or early later in a Paleo safe I guess. Counterpick on support technically but I still feel like I save him work on a slightly as you can with black shield off all your self regardless though as the wave is going to push back around you spoke at the farm lead on the afelio so you should have no problem getting to choose when the recall comes in the only way that would stop if it said you know we would rather play for Drake instead will it will break damage so far that's not the case once again is the second Bloom we have now seen spot Woodley clearing his jungle there's really no chance in the folder to be surprising in the fact that they were kind of has been on the back foot in this that double pedal went to closer in the Guardians x 1/2 bushing fat lady even taken a turn plate this early on which I do mind fairly surprising and a given that you know Morgana plus this Calista are pretty drawing there are you Kathy pole vaulter was looking for the entire group and not quite able to get it you do you have planned to eat for uwt actually have that via Route now it is otherwise just a slow I thought I was he hasn't paid for quite some time so Demonte has that window the lamp is gold card before kobalter could actually get that route set up for weekly attention if you're always able to go with gold card has locked that means mate can always be safe and I spoke flashes in or something you know more than listen to press the button really hard here I'm sure there's a reason why I've been watching the lane entirely in the mouth but felt like with blankets are they had if they want to take them back and forth I think they could have as well and it you know that it's just the gas but not in my mind if I'm playing afelio sand in the coolest in a plane gets Calista and we're both just AFK farming and no one has idubbbz I'm actually really happy at the FL Leos so maybe he felt like if I staying in Lane he would deny the base timing of his opponent and just keep them both on these these small items you know this is going to be stronger on earlier items so maybe just felt like a we just people walked in laying here we just continue this passive no item farming out style I try to delay a little bit more waves and then do the 7-minute Recon said this should allow unless he's inspiration secondary if it allows boots and things like this it'll be a bigger power spikes I'm curious what else he wants to pick up here certainly actually say something
a little bit quieter in lane and Sunday in contracts to create all the acting up on the top side a lot of people have started to throw a lot more fans towards someday but extremely cheap stuff see what they do with your Twisted Fate right after that pretty much hundred percent pick ban this bar contracts the target is on your back from Right Out The Gate Middle he's only won one game in the ALCS it was in the hands of contracts throughout the split were talking about Closer Closer Closer number to All Pro jump lift in the spring split he's truly one of the big Terry's for Golden Guardians he is tied for first for most kills of LCS game to split end of the jungler no less yes close was great contracts blows most of his early game stats out of the water first Blood rate five out of seven 71% fruit blood rate for contract the man gets it donegold lead the XP lead in the early game he gets it all done absolute to nominal jungler in the early game Guess Who want to see him play around someday that's a big magic for us here at the band's going through a bad delay for Demonte I was just as you were talking about before with the grades of Italy and the contract Olaf comes through foreclosure Golden Gardens want to pinch early games done with and I will still want to see them go to push a drum style midliner for Demonte have been taken out but you can still do things like Echo but I have a very similar purpose or you're trying to help with that big wave and get some rum. Threats of internal conversations about you know that it affected they said they actually came out I will say that it was picked as it wasand if we see around play LeBlanc which he has it all splits over like a few lysandra it would be the reason why does the same things that you're looking for you can be an initiator for Devante with a heart CC so it definitely does look good especially in those situations vs. LeBlanc but Olaf karma is the name of the game book that jungle her up we talked about so many time specially with this combo adding the speed and shield to Olaf makes your late game a lot more effective and not going to lock it in and this round a little bit of a beat there but still really wanted to get locked in in round two of their choice here before it gets bad to weigh cuz I really doubt that, with drop-down do the second phase of pics maybe if Elias the rest of the family goes to your FBI is going to play that every single time and dad are at 3 to go to play David championyou are right they want to spend the full minute or thrash was a productive cough what are they Banning what are we losing what are pillows going to be okay it lines up it's going to be, right I like how it was going to go cuz it was always a fairly Oceanside yes you might have to run cleanse against much BC that I be difficult we don't fight the lantern instead of his good comes out after it's a cold, and I dropped off the map so I expect hundred thieves to Blind something for a Ryoma gear you know Oriana Zoe those types of Champions Midland and then they can save their counter pick for red side for some day to get an advantageous backup for him Hitman contracts at work so beautifully toAdvantage 100 thieves on that side of the map so that's why all these Top Lane bands are coming through golden Guardians want to take away option for someday and someday trying to protect himself here I will say karma candy what's tier Demonte can't pick it up for the split that was another champion with very good wave Queen who wants to run down to help someone out everybody who you go on like an Alistair suddenly instead and the whole team comp looks different in the way it plays out you're expecting car but nine times out of ten to go down to who he there based on what these players have been doing but I could see it fit the composition you seeing more Champions with Riesling cage tools taking off the bath is Rubble loses the R button as well. But not been played by Golden Gardens at the split but it would certainly work the tenant is it take to be the Top Lane. Never feel good and all your matches what you got in a lot so I think I'll put in a fuel comfortable with it obviously have the to bill pass to choose from but overwhelmingly andoften a really good answer always like having a debt on my team to dump the cannon back out of Team fights if they can and finds a blank you have always tried Mark II Canon where's the teleport coming from where is the cannon actually trying to engaged and you just sold them right back out of the team fight so that's a direct answer right there for number one to your point about Karma she can build support and still it's a queer things to clear back wave if she takes minion dematerializer and spend them that way that's what I was doing a bunch in LPL and it is going to be the Zoe though most of support, At Your Service okay well push and roll pushing room that's the Zoe motto and that's going to work here for you well has put one game on two but it's going to work or Jana going to be heretypically say that feels good for Zoe but where am I going to be on another team fight May split is a pure tank yes someday can lock people down and bring donuts he has to contract to get and now I'm a little bit of damage but pure Frontline ER this is actually cute this Lexie or of course that can play support and more comfortable probably not to put the kennet yeah it is it definitely does better for that matchup and the set set it a whole nother Champion simply because of the existence of hexfly if not for the existence of that rude then we would not see a pic it in that role at all because so much of it comes from having your nipples cloaks speed after your your head flashing going for those constant threat of engages out of the project no jumping over walls in it and using your cues be on top of it and that really opens up more doors for him I definitely like itas far as you can really threatened for those Paul ince so, top comes through for hanser being Champion unique Champion number 10 across his game so far that's going to be excited to watch how that could use to one full but I like it I think looks really good we'll see how well they can do with a stamp overall and texture it does mean that set is there only hard engage on the line up Zoe can do a little bit with the Pope but it's often hard to make that completely work you know, one be 5:00 when there is counterpunch available to the other Squad rightly cynical and the key when you go over and then follow you go for a quick flash that's difficult but possible in some of the watch for He Is We are on a trip for our last game of The Weeknd golden Guardians only one game above hundred thieves right now if they win their up and sell it to game with the two head-to-head making it very easy to stay in the upper bracket part of the playoffsonly catches app will still get the Flash and are you kidding me you're not killing to finally first what I mean who he flashed to try and get this done there but I didn't quite have the exact angle so it didn't get them and they end up having it burn more Summoners they still get to kill do freak so so rewarded money onto closer on to the Olaf at the cost of The Flash from Olaf there's no way that you can really punish Olaf early though just as yams in especially with the first blood so every time you're very happy to trade your flash like that off despite his way out of any sort of situation that's not a one.all right well Red Bluff start of the one side hauntzer going to lie should you leave about two seconds for the by the way thank you and leave is too much are the Cavs going to go through this or do you know whose it is the TSM Jungle of leashes here is yeah we're going to take another look at another face jack off to get through on the other side to bring in for the stud that's why the flashing over that acts does mr. Wait till he sees that he misses the ACT then has to commit the flash I finally gets the third one to advise if that last Axe by going 90 degrees north and just guessing correctly killed by to flip like it was so close to not getting that kill yeah you can consider in this life for food if they check that one and then have to turn you away but also means no pressure by the way one spell exactly and you don't get even give the help back to your bit later like we're soap and seeing a lot of the farts been doing booty tho immediately able to fish around and they do see even that workplace so early I think it will be known you have an option for Lane ganking you can slip in there no extra Cypress towards obvious it's really important because of the fact that a flash list bar does a really easy gang Target and that means that who he playing that brush Rec Splash or clothes or sign up for a gank from that side of the map would be really really deadly so clear through all the clubs at 3:05 obviously with the extra-long sore in crease of the spell damage Rafi Autotech damage play a fast clearing there currently up to cancel the contract who's going through tough schedule we'll see if that plays out in the public stressful to go to be able to keep up with your query there so maybe looks for a top lamp play Fly floor plastic pots or something like that hospital immediately walks down to check Scuttle crab as closer alerts and hey I'm trading these topside is already taken by contracts so now on so I can play a little bit safer in the kind of match up with some days got the mini wave in a very nice spot though I might even be denying a decent amount, trying to throw out to use to just yes nobody calls come through double longsword plus blue Smite closer is very powerful in the jungle Hunter doesn't play a fair bit up but some people have a hard time letting crowd control on the karma as you can play pretty far away enough to walk up to get some nice hot cocoa in the back line that's going to be who he finding a stunt clutch comes through as well that was painful to Ruthven place to stay alive the Q is going to land on minions happy I cannot get any more follow-through and goes and eat some nice hot chocolate yeah pretty good a heel on the are eggs a side there for himself someday just say yes in a way here versus hanser the small Advantage for hot sore but since the minion wave he's on Sunday side going to start to build up a little bit year their reinforcements arrive quicker no harm no foul pretty good defensive War gear for Hunter and Carmen barely slippery hard to gank unless someday can get close enough Land one of those QC flashing With Yuri try and give your mini stuff to set up gangsta 3 vs 2 good luck getting away TVs coming in on both sides to show up if I can look like now something's going to land on a wine hunt Laporte pick a lock with a turtle live but now it is ever a time to go for Drake it's now your entire spots right here yeah so there's two choices to Golden Gardens need to do the resources I need to have a rotation to send somebody up to get the top way so you can already see on the mini-map Ryoma pushes mid-wave then heads up top waves Prime push that to you can try and stay one rotation ahead of your opponents and I'll just have all pawn to reset someday take over the mid-wave this is just more efficient use of your cell Elena since both of them were able to transition and they can still pick up the extra meaning waves in exchange. Golden Guardians happy to pay for that Dragon it with the gold of these many waves are going to lose like 1 melee the Canon minion waves going to soak the rest of them and Hunters are already here yeah that's the downside is technically the way. Had a cannon to the push was slow and it made it was pretty easy for Uncle to show up in time without losing too much gold he's comfy level six is there no problem in that side someday is actually the one who is a little bit hurting here is he's going to sit in Midland for a while receiving why I'm a walk down to that lane so someday we'll head back top but for now he's going to bleed a little bit of farm as the wave is slowly slowly dying contract level 5 time with Olaf your clothes and can't count and someday we'll eventually walk over to his land to get the rest of the gold in the Box a has to fight this fight will get sound but closer with the bubble Emmys has nothing to be had those are shows up at level deficit makes it difficult some they can't get much more done to have to go to regular me to Monta no scrub Sunday though cuz it takes, a little bit while to build that one back up in your eyes back top light just at the arrival of those minions even though that teleport bottom was very painful and detrimental to add a pretty pretty low on CS as we go get least he's able to get back for the second wave on the bounce back nightwell spell book of course here for the car must stay in for the Canon as they switch out of the teleport to go for a night he took the first big play and now it's time to play for the one of the ones here and the first Pieces come through child feels really really good enanthate match up with Kenan is super comfortable to Monterrey steel closes that's my blubaugh sorry but that's the way it goes please send you the topside hanser play foot sound of a tether going to be sun. Leaf in his hear no read out for contract kill picked up just at the edge of that placing Maelstrom they catch him with a stun two versus one closer went in bottom side is trading currently valve no health bars close recipe a little bit respectful to take the ferry to damage down to 500hp should survive
abilities to carry so don't give up too much ground elsewhere yeah I will note for a cloud 9 sake that they're bought Lane seems to be slightly winning with a pretty non-interactive Lane overall now the office there is FBI new heroic bid for a tail and that's going to happen timestack away for that but the actual two-on-two went pretty well on cloud nine speed for the Deeds of course have suicide scene I'm at the laws have shows blueside here for the rest of the way they're going to see if he is going to not be on a global Champion will have to rely only on summer teleport for that and I feel a long time coming looking at overall stats for the player 3tf akali so he's going to be on something else this time around clearly had been very keen to play the globals in Canton now I am suspicious of a cloud nine cop with bladder on easier I feel like operates really well when when you have either rangeMobility onion on the on the Cari Champion to be able to make some you know how plays aggressive plays lunar doesn't do a lot of outplay he does a lot of Brute Force Pro Car Guy hears already gave the number to hear they're going to they're going to change your going to have a charge for Stiles now a hundred thieves do they have a lot of options cuz there's a lot easier to control with quit hiding than any of the other Champions at blabbering normally place is the XP at 10 different leader of this entire amount of all 10 players he does really heavily out for his opposition was a champion that is good when does leveling up his abilities getting rank 5 in Phoenix and then level 16 rank 6 in Phoenix that's going to feel bare feet and exciting and I'm a big fan of seraphine with walk at you melee championship belts you'll be off of them she gives haste of Champions likeyou only need it for like this is the making of a good composition I'm not sure if it's been I think she's good in both those rolls through fire like a like a Renekton or something along those lines some days Renekton you look for an even match up in here at best I expect a hundred thieves to send that use last round of their first phase Pixar on Renekton maybe leave a car instead take away those two main possible you know Champions here for flights to even feel comfortable on and then work with the famed Renekton nidalee use this so so many times you stood him up with W Spears land and if he dies honestly if if the grass is not banteer I think that would bepretty big oversight four hundred thieves meanwhile Cloud9 trying to ban the way supports on the other side you do for possible leans into seraphine I do expect them to go you don't either Misfortune or Ash. It's a similar strategy to The Misfortune where misfortunes is better in my opinion at it because make it rain at tens kids and you can just cast it as the cert seraphine shoots out a projectiles but land the first slow so then seraphine get to snare for follow-ups as long as you land the vale so we'll see 449 if they want it kind of combo with that Wombo the other main focus your C9 is trying to get some priority in their Lane Port Moody or to work with so they can actually a powerful and so he can actually get you know to the the turbo cam chain so we can get more speed for the canteen in cages and the Bandit way who he set you see how to see you throwing some bands over at Fudge get rid of those safer waveclear kinds of Champions and you mentioned the possibilityso you could do like the najib an oven take support us and then I've gotten three Top Lane removals but the Alex Remains the hover looks like to be the lock-in don't fail us with right you can see out of the serafino so you can get people away and then kind of resuscitate your team for that so it does I think fit a composition Obviously good setup for Kaiser as well you have to crap when she goes all into the canoe very scary people ain't as well and navigate to see what the last picture club Manor going to be we have to be top and you know what are the two bottles of Vulcans Alistar as well playing this okay team fight this guarantees you already mentioned you know sarafine very good with Brute Force compositions Tarik is also very good if you have something I can guarantee they engage I think they need something now to guarantee like like you know a hectic ultimatum something to to lock your opponent's down to force them to fight with an aultimate decoy scooter with the turbo kente can run very quickly but there is disengage the old and then here looking like yes you cancel engraved but I would put more money on the new deal for topside he definitely can trade decently vs. Renekton we have not seen this matchup in a very very very long time but but we can't go Phoenix for for Wave Control while he's trading with a Renekton the difference and since we haven't seen in a long time is can he actually take the stand toe-to-toe trays with Renekton try and use your turtle stance healing back up off the wave remember Renekton can break Shields with a fully charged W looking for down there so be careful with your turtle standall right top right now and he's got a key Advantage I guess we don't have to worry about the stat check that for her. You can try and pull that one out but Grace obviously going to try and use the rage Advantage here nice little twist from from cloud at the end where are they going to you know not back down on game 2 already of a best-of-five in their pick and ban phase they don't they do it with the twist they give up their range Advantage Care of vs. Renekton let's see it. Fudge cuz there is definitely a lot riding on this your top priority is very important if you're facing Renekton Italy to try and break that definitely takes a lot I just wonder if it's even really killable like a scooter cease be enough to kill Renekton when like minions block virtually all of Grey's is damaged like I'm not sure you get anything going topside Electrictell me when the killed because you have a bunch of birth they locked out I don't see the easy way for you know this this top site for cloud nine am done over there beside feels like some set up to the minions play around bitter Bots and you're only ever counted income for the top side we'll see if it comes through. It is a best-of-five first of the Season between Cloud9 and hundred feed the winner of game three four five hundred take is going to go into the lock in finals on Sunday waiting for EG Ortiz fight back, did not work without fudge brings in the top Greys for Selective pressure with such a lack of enthusiasm my heart just dropped and then I probably got a gay could you counter gagie is so important because you can turn this around so effectively and remember Top Lane being a long way in keeping your vision control of your side brush is way more difficult the most difficult for any of any of the laners there so there are a lot of opportunities for a champion like you do it does have to rely on just move speed to to take opportunities of controlling the brush on the top side of the map slipping in for Lincoln's for brush King also big big big Focus router is always PVE as everyone is well accustomed to now that it is actually become a premier pick and an Elsa gay and LPL except one of the most spectacular actually for this last week for both of those leagues trying to power Farm try to focus on the dragon control try to focus on your Rift Herald you don't have to score a kill to be able to have a successful top-ranking Caswell by the way you can just work with your grades either counter ganking or showing so he shoves the wave with full priority verses are in acts in a very easy for a grave to do to control that wave with a range of an ad with the alien Vantage and transition it into Rift Herald you earn money very very effectively like that just taking that top Psych show cuz you don't have to call a bottom side rotation over for it nice little damage there and Ice q auto could chuck and who he and you can't keep the farm going on the bottom side did go for a point there stands at 3 I do believe I might have missed that one regardless of course shopping around the topside Billy will be top sites to have to be careful this way is going to bounce I believe it was known that closes on blubaugh so but we'll have to be careful because it's capable very very soon and if it will take red you could already be yanking I would be very very surprised and flattered went for a point in bearskins because you can power clear your entire or jungle and get to level four fours go to craft demon Spa what does Champion Energy level for to get the Bears dance rank to Phoenix really really really improves your clear level four. Even sponsor robot game even ordered it first blood for old are baby let's go players season 1 championship with the speed of the clear again for your attack speed by the way the gay cop who he uses the speed you'll get out of the. Philip range of the queue get right back in. Ensuring this kill blabber is not going down without a fight free 204 the Udyr already and when a champion like this get the lead in the jungle now you lose all PVE control yes Natalie does not have to fight that you know you can always run but if you're always running giving up camps giving up territory giving up Vision on a map then that where the the objectives start to roll in for cloud nine to two very important early kills here for flapper remember he does not have a flash so using your bear stance speed to be able to dodge Spears and stuff is going to be important oh my God. so freak sometimes people also would ask me why why do play who Do so much. It's very easy to fall off your mechanics are the champion it was also previously thought that you can't miss Spears I'm starting now you can't honestly yeah maybe you thought he was out of it or just just simply misplaced it but that is going to cost them you don't have to spend their resources topside attempt to dive as well teleport from Perks comes in to defend this time and this is all going the other way number 100 thieves very clear game plan coming in good shape select to go for the engages and they pulled them off all game long this time around though Cloud 9 waste no time and striking back and there's lots of land surrounded play top felt I felt something has twice as much but I did just based on how things were going to let you know what they look at 3 for fudge sundaes back every time you don't have to kill fudge I will kill your bored it said but can we get any minion XP not really yet know I think I got a three-way light so far this might be number for they do get into the experience range birth with the rotation over does alleviate the pressure and even with another attempt your 400 these continue to try on that that top Focus that nidalee Renekton trying to build on their draft it is keeping put down and see us and he is here with the early visit towards the grave but as you say unsuccessful in scoring to kill true self lever going to feel pretty comfortable pushing on to Art 7 now it has been an equal can't count for both junglers Bowser has Farm equally to bladder and they just haven't threatened to kill so they've been as active just once been more successful and you can see the 600 gold lead to Cloud 9 is the result from that one gray is from behind though he's barely a champion damaged steel caps all ready for when they match up again down the line and you know doesn't have much you to speak of you can temporarily blind the rise that's not too bad but not that you will have the combo deck painting his life to make sure it happens now can you
how to get to the better of this foot so far though yeah for sure I mean that last time around we we had the matchup even in rivalry week at CSM took that one as well since then they made some changes you into the bottom way and I think you'd look really good for DSM I'm moving up from their icademy roster performing quite well with double if so we'll see how well they can navigate the gank this time around cuz that was one of the big things I remember from passing the first one weekly he cleared award and then still got off a successful gank heading towards bottom side like two seconds later even with TSM Vision let's see if they can track the enemy don't go a little bit better this time around pretty standard bad so far away from doublelist in TSMyou see a lot more the flex fix screen Target to hear 2nd round purse that Vale to shampoo the case right there of course we're expecting to have an early game lead overall he looked like a player go to print says it's you bring them across the Templars of game is TSM TSM psmt is it okay for plants pretty well and that's kind of the way they never shake out right now so we'll see if seals you can step up your game these teams are only three get the part in the standings if the last couple weeks ago well if he's healed you could pass them it is possible Right candidate is the iPass work in the field that that is a possibility if they can play with you well we're singing it is Diovan another chance we are seeing increased involvement in the matter of course we've seen somebody there is fence that champ is gone and so was I have for 3 tomorrow to ask you to pull the arrow exactly it's the old and they are the feathers and layingI am to the matchups put there ever been a couple as well in ltk and LPL into you know asriel and he's in The Misfortune as on top of it but they are way from doublelift kind of pushing him towards the Azrael which he does not have a place on the champion actually summer Adderley airbag inflate exactly three Champions counting from one of senna good night dance place before the split this is number nine right there and don't get me wrong but if it is Botley you have a lot of pushing a lot Polk and waterproofing yeah it's also really stayed away from the Azrael and in recent memory now Korea obviously they both had a lot of place on the champion Diantha All-Stars highlight clip where he gets a pentacle with Ezreal so I'm sure he still has the fingers for it on the other side for CLG though they get wetGraves very safe jungler here to be backed up by galio most players like playing Graves trying to Oak View's your early range advantage and a lot shuttle crab fight a lot of aggressive lose looking to arrest their opponents either taking phase rush and then having sommerfeldt ignite a lot of the time or even I've seen a couple you'll cleanses and stuff if your feet are freezing PC second grade games that has been on take duty free much full-time he has german-speaking like really low. Is he is there trying to be like the facilitator for the team but he's incredibly incredibly low gold share in the late game he had a daughter could all sticks and pulled out there and it's up to those two to carry as we just saw door lock on Dick the top a couple game to go do you really want to see Graves take out of the farm getfolding jungler and be one of the best things are factors in teamfights light games we will be a yes I am going to be on tanked let us play around if I go to diagnose I want to see that style I want to let him go do that and play robot Linx procedure make a difference and see if I liked it a lot of podcast more conservative place are the Reds tanks or or safer play he did have the Wukong game yesterday I had a pretty good match up there and was able to have a really good performance I think he's had some of his games overall do on tanks in Oran and Poppy specifically so happy to see him on that they do wisely band at the Camille they don't want to let ruin have a twitching often they also don't want to let theLeo Carrillo combination go through there are still others foot twitching options you can take if you wanted to open that up when they are one of the ones in the patch was a bunch of the extra attack speed in the mini form when you get your hop off and you can try and use that to whittle down or need you harass him after trying to avoid the combo and kind of hard. Fort warned to get his Pitbull brutal proc combo off on our because of the evasiveness and actress fee that you get one or otherwise a lot of Fighters even things like Ken and sonar is more of ruined still going his way I don't know if you could really get ink for car into orange overalls on other lightsa client with Ash Graves only difficulty is armor stacking for your fault line is going to be effective is Cassiopeia Browns on a team flight top 40 SF I love this in the galley I wanted to see it more as well as been to be the best performer on the entire team for TSM now he's got the power in his hands in Gallia you can really abused that match of the poison to my asthma is really good at stopping any sort of the opportunities to create plays for I'm within the mid lane off of Weakley moving around through the jungle you know you were trying to use your Graves matchup it's pretty easy for Grace giant Dodge Charger viniq use Galileo classic try and get that ultimate down on him early to back up those invades ash brown on the bottom side even allows you to go for level 1 invades so that's what I want to see from c o g they need to use this champ select from the very beginning toearly Wards down deep into the jungle maybe even go for a steal away on one of the bus and and try and use that to snowball there early game plan ahead alright well I'm going to be really important and very soon here as CLG npsm do battle counter logic gaming their friend a hold on their upper bracket birth in playoffs they have Team opponent's team's right behind them looking to steal a spot away drop in the lower bracket of course that's before that we just talked to yell when they still got a lot of work cut out for them 2 and 1/2 games behind a playoff bye with 5 to play it can't be done but it's going to be difficult a win against the LG of course it's a step towards that we are on a trip let's see how it goesyeah TSM have a lot of good scaling options Cassiopeia obviously is going to be a monster should have a pretty pretty good Lane as well as being able to get a death cap upgrade later on for broken plate if they make it that far so you see TSM playing defensively they are working already and watching openings for that level one that I was trying to Shield me to go for the even go as far as to Ward red and blue for themselves as they're really worried about it and weekly going to start on the blue side still does have the option to go for it but the early alert systems to think good for TSM trying to avoid any of these scenarios in which carbon starting red you can even have the super cheesy like level to you you risked a lot when you do this against the graves Graves can punish you at Levi stealing away camps in a bit even afterwards but it does have the option there were you have CP at level two kind of rare for most jungle championsnot really quickly write both technically don't pass for the Jarvis negative armor on Red Bluff make that pretty easy grade finishing up flu and they going on the graphing a second shouldn't be too far behind but really really early harassed york-penn both Washington case there's a flash Auto he wouldn't have lived otherwise posted felt a little bit late gives himself the thumbs down to that is immediate claim Kingdom 40th yeah that's why I can't like I was like I really wanted to see this more into the prevalent galio but person abuses it even harder than I thought he was going to be able to fuse it half of that for his poisoned Chase's of dad who is that stalker chasing pobelter back through the lane and forces this double Summoners absolutely insane yorkson let me just even talk further about him because he hasn't been up and down your today's been so good for them extremely consistent he has the most solo kills with any player in the LCS right now on the team as well and it would Cassiopeia having this goodstart burning both Summoners maybe with a juggler like Jarvis you can even see some extra pressure coming through I would definitely highly recommend it currently no warts on the top side so piercing goes up to that side to make sure they get first vision and that will give them some areas to try punish and Friends hope out there big wave building here as well I will bitterly damage down there Has Broken Blade going to fight of the top light and wave ruin of course counterpick in the match up with Fleet footwork to keep his boobs be sustained solid and she stay away from those pillows not get knocked up right now no more control for either toppling anywhere near topside roof that's down probably that right now is fika with your first win the fight at sing spell peace Retreat you probably got to get a lot of folks down you want to keep the man to pull up so you can keep going for the shots you like it at throat a fair bit of work but don't go to the more defensive option ROM Ash can run you down and I'm always fine with him going to fence it when it specially as a mid-length galio that you're facing so you're like a decent chance we get some board members down here in the bottom side with you with a scrub set up but I definitely feel you want you'll try to play offensive Lee as well in and buying extra gold going to rest meat goes out in the item higher it's a good 20 or so more ability Power by mid to late game at that matter right it can be a good teammate or not we're killing it be Champion regardless though we have some look towards topside is the key was down for broken play the bad apples bit short because here there is a gank he's kind of Duty sticking around another word comes down for real because okay will a top pressure I can get some relief site see you on graves pretty threatening so spend some time since I don't wear your safety be stuck in the wave see you later yeah it's hard for days rest Graves who Dodges the EQ unless you act like you ain't got a fog of War something or you get a really nice one good surprised the grace is going to run circles around you and chase you down real hard on the exit do you have to play after laner tier for the drive-in and Main Lena right now obviously Purex in being able to get his phone early Advantage we could try to keep this in for him but quickly is going to definitely pull further and further ahead in the farm since because spending so much time just trying to track he's been tracking weekly on weekly side of the map where he's getting answer while speaker is falling too far behind in CS go back to Liang it's right up I ruined looks like this normal to make the same kind of choice then she like that in any low-impact Lane going to Russia call items and just go into your real deal from there so it could have been picked up the build towards Black Cleaver no surprises there in the olden days we saw things like one of the ruined King and raise blade in Fanta Fanta hair that's probably not the option here but who's going to feel real good probably going to be a Teen Titan Go for him and it go for the big stars on to Cassiopeia get through the back like on a crack them with the galio on top should be able to get it no problem they had slain pressure as well as bottom land you'll recall there for counter logic gaming and speakers definitely go to be behind in the 1 verse 1 verse praise but you're not really trying to take those one first one we mentioned before trying to be a team enabler what's a busy to me is actually TSM has the lowest first dragon rate in the LCS despite being a team around bottom Lane and the fact that I would say he's been eating pretty well overall has solid gold install XP leads a good later they've never been able to pick up those objectives very off at this time around though they will get that one little bit of kind of pressure right now for CLG is the cargo sent back to bake pick up some more Mana regen in this game pieces be picked up here as well and might mean a recall can come before too terribly long upgraded boots for 6 a.m. he's he's going to wait around for a while and ultimately it's just the farming era of Ezreal where you get your tear your call just trying to last it charge up your Mana item here no problem and wait to grow into the two core item real big carry used here roughly on cool but you want the faster the better that comes online on the same time as you green upgrade that's going to feel to be good and out of the power respect is not always exactly gold gated right it's reloaded to make sure using to you after he's a time and everything else toppling still a bit of a broken plate holds the fart lead with four minutes even to kill so really feeling good with this one right he hasn't really had any intention from guitar pick up for now done yeah how to see in the next 2 minutes Air Force EOD is some looks with the galley open Spellbook switch over to ignite he's got flash ignite this galio is ready to kill level 6 this is where you want to start seeing the force come through Wiggly's already got the level Leon Graves they are looking for with your grave starving match up sticks sticks off that crap though so he's going to have a few more options. Even if they do you go for the invite but the play still the same looking for the set Up Stix he's got his ass Cheryl you can get your
all right very fancy works at a moo banzet number one near Jensen honestly don't deserve more bands from Cloud 9 Benton has been at one of the main a big performers to your 14 liquid doing a lot of the work right along there with corejj you know and the bottom went all right let's get our stuff situated to this one of the prize bladder the early aggression is so damn powerful backed up by Nipsey backed up by Vulcans world have to walk for his wife we believe he couldn't Champion is not in this patch but maybe one day he'll be fun to watch for down the line and you're seeing any individual agency bands right Cloud 9hippos be limited feels like a Leo RTF vs. Hela block that would feel for okay so they're going to leave out the possibility of Galia I mean Misty was even tweeting out about please bangali against me so I don't have to play for the team does it fits five nights ago well I did lock it up every single time on the other side though for tactical I mentioned the bottom Lane till it was already banned out that is one of their more proactive combination but they have so many game with the fellas and trying to go for the later style this is a big question that people been wondering are we going to try and just wait out Cloud 9 early or are they going to try and take the fight to them signals the first option they are not going to try and take the fight to Cloud 9 in the early game if you're picking broxah a trundle it's a lot moreI'm focused objective Focus yes there are champions that you can have successful gang sign with pillar running at them and getting the slope but obviously not going to be something that rocks the prize the contestant bladder with too much early because Club Band band in early so that later on Spotify this is actually a Luck Stone Oak bottomland Shield bottom Lane that really just as so annoying to to play against this is something that Team Liquid types of styles they have used in the past when there has been healing Shield combinations annoy the heck out of peopleneed to get to like at least a core item or two and some extra levels before you'll start to just get so freaking big that they can take over these fees dragon fight if your phone is not stacked dragon versus you very early on then your team fire powers what comes through Sonos a lease deals and Lexus are we sealed applying for multiple people when you get to Lux pass through on on both of them it just provides anything's the matter right now we're evolving around bearded dragon twice as long as your opponents don't get off to a very big early lead that then that's where you can to try and take over it I like it you need chords JJ and tactical some form some way to try and punish them if you can fish for some early kills even with a triangle coming down if blitzcrank can do it all for you right you pillar that set of a possible blitzcrank pool and that means that there's not as much burden on the jungler to do soMichael the creation of the gulf and poor JJ can have his hand through the work couple of thoughts here I have Zona if she is a heart before is a stealing support you want a snack at manifold you want to Stack Up have to bind as soon as your manifolds infinite at least one that said they are lacking a hyperscale and crit marks when someone can aptly burn it down a front-line tank impact on Oren to me would make a lot of sense of like Sion orshan would work here as well then taken away they are diving in hecarim Over the Top Shot in the back like I'm so excited as a shield from all Laneslisten to pack with Olaf builds for him if you have a charging in there where bust a very long time ago do the fear duration for long-range old he's got you can get your Luck's field before you charge in Azure running up Sonos Shield you got to stand on top of you for a lot of beef bottom Lanes side of the map primitive it's one of impact very best Champions but you steal away a possible impaction and U-joint kit for licorice I really like what they said up here my question is ya handsome liquid finest can they are trying to get some blitzcrank roaming kills. Members of Cloud 9 and a break apart the synergies that exists here because so much of this is all right we've got this double Shields bottomland soda and Lux we're want them to join these mid-game team fights that's where you get all the value we don't get all these shields for everybody else I've got two thoughts I'm going to go for 1number one Good Luck stats part of this one but this feels like one of the only times that not considered a season opener where does this is us that we're all five players are playing a new Champion the first time this split play going 15 games anything like yep first-time set first time shame first time Hector and first-time setup for Silex yes events play as Sunnah before in his League career but in this play it's a new one I put up the plants that look for a good look at you proving it it's got to be rare after week 6 or so regardless the other part is this is probably the best mordekaiser pick I have seen in a very long time it is going to smash soda so hard in teamfights she cannot get away from him she wants to buffer entire team she cannot see her entire team impact me getting a ton of free ability power I don't know how he's been supposed to win that says we should probably go to be second item when you coming to teamfight phase me. To come through I like the Mortal. You to break it apart as real is safe in the back line to have to grab that you can maybe get away from Akronand are there going to be some Dives in this game yeah that's what I talk about is breaking the team apart whenever you see a team with this by Synergy like you're talking about you want combo breakers from wherever you can possibly get them well we'll see how much going to happen if we are on the rift and if the Killer Instinct is going to be enough from cloud nine or Team Liquid know what they're doing it can get through this one no conventional Marksman physical damage profile a little bit low so a tank line can be really durable here on the TL side we'll see how well set Bountiful Concentra and got a point out double spellthief bottling prevent and valgus of blabber to be poaching a crap ton apartment about link is that a technical term there I definitely agree the poaching will be revelant defensive word invade with a blitzcrank here and they are scouting easy evasive maneuvers for Cloud 9 in a good word that comes down to where it can never be seen by TL on the way Force they can't know for sure that Ward is there you can surmise in her that maybe there is a deep or the blue up but they sought to yell walk forward then turn around so the best we're going to get from TL is trying to stop lever spacing and see if they know I just love that are battle of the top teams is delivering already just in champ select free top of North America are actually innovating the only showing a game from season 10 is that Wonderstone atop gave that that's the tea to play and then for Lux there's only been one in season 10 as the support in lck for that TRX game this is this is pure and a Innovative right now it's and again it's going to come from one of those of a bottomless out things that we used to see where know we had carry Sonos and we had a lot of the active healing style ones this is going to be another one highlighting the shields Guardian before you get pallets. So if they wanted with her to see us has been in Bolton could trade off last hitting Bailey minions leave the castles up and lose 14 gold you know for a pinion but no get that money back from from doing spell decent cooldown to Golden Compass pretty closest as a result of that one I don't want to point out as a Keepsake two things at once I love there is a pregame interview from Reaper the Cloud 9 coach you said yeah it's kind of a rocky rose rock and we're going to go back to comfort pics to lock you in for Speed I love both of them. Mid lane get to pull back on the Jensen gets away from the Sun but it still goes through so full damage reduction in there as Here Comes Rasta outside. We're looking for a pillar in to hook flat look knock it's going to land here comes to look pretty soon it will not go down at full power at the moment they don't have to burn flashes for either supports player in the bottom side still looking pretty clean he recorded they didn't use his course to start that out so it takes away some of the threat nisky and the Midland yeah but that's a pillar that damage got Tristan has manafort spell combo and Brockton to Blue Buffalo chop is not going to happen taste of that how you like that for I Got 5 minutes later. Have a lesson to do push-ups a wave into the tower I think Jason will be able to clean up a decent amount of those as you can see he is still play quite far ahead and say yes Eva lynskey continually going for the aggressive plays now I might have to flash out might have this done be careful in this depop sambuca through the summer with heel Fresno and he's got to get this done but here comes TT Shen but cordage a severe as well how's it going to go not going to get back to the are the flash comes out really really good play buy licorice now finds the top of his rid of damage to kill Corte De Nosotros no hook up you got to be kidding me send crabs the kill well-played licorice Russell can't get any more this solos combined for a Kilim support hell yeah is delivering on all levels Cloud 9 fire away is a bit late they get the first blunt it is a liquor is in Stella 442 midlane impact now it does get the Shelf in the top side but as you can see on screen bottom ciphercloud night also got to push the wave all the way in and knows what it does mean is it going to start to wear a waist soften up that turret play as well then liquor is able to get back to topside pretty quickly after using a cell for cuz look at a mini nap right now before you teleport it down he shoved in the wave and one for his recall so he got on his item and he doesn't have to go back to face you just went straight stop after this really nice to meet you at once again licorice boosted music you pass through then able to get the glass out of Jensen and if I hold his tot the whole time he's able to get for JJ with it notice he also tried to block or JJ with his champion model staying on that side forcing a little bit of extra movement from him around the edge because the last impact Burns flash to her health left they're going to go for the flash on of a turret and Cloud 9 have found the aggressive plays they want kills across-the-board all right maybe it's only delivering from one side 3 cuz we keep this exciting game they are all by Cloud 9 Team Liquid right now struggling to deal with the onslaught that has come right out of Champion Select they did go for the play bottom that we are looking for sandbox it down there trying to make something happen with for JJ with you switch prank full but the shields were too much of them the bottom Lane is just looking to deny right now scale up as you mention and you know you're looking for a man is killing on him you're already purchased for Sona you're trying to get levels in these guys so that they could bring the big shield for your team fights meanwhile blabber and licorice making plays on the top side of map just like they have done all split long Team Liquid though this is the big move for them first move of the game for them to get a real advantage and they will at least get the first dragon here wow Sona and looks are still weak yeah Jensen had to push in Midland there as well shove then took the recall so they knew oh min-seok vostok to start I'm easy 3d one by was not going to show the tick that went down well played the them good pick up there so we can drink of the boards for Team Liquid 1,000 gold leave the Cloud 9 side as a SWOT liners Sheriff arm back and forth actual see if it's pretty close and Vulcan CS count as one each on taxol side his to get some of the matters of anything that corejj last just be back at school anyway 5356 be at fault line on the board as well can't notice blabber uses the ultimate rides beginning so he goes Unstoppable no chance for Jensen to try and deny him and knock him back or anything can you get a really nice combination here killing Jensen on the minion wave so that this Farm is basically but that is not going to Jensen still level 6 on the syndra death for him going to definitely set that the possibilities here for
standard goldendoodles contract when he was already on the academy team this is why don't they are staying with Viper in the Top Lane deer as well and he has his work cut out for him all right off the bat I like a t t Target band Phoenix no azir will make it through that's one of the most important things to bet against big dots of course the other one everyone's going to shout Viper eat in the game keep ribbon within your mind usually teams will use their second-round advance to go after vipers ribbon not feeling like they are going to early pick it because we need to try and counter pic real quick and then what that one through other side is both are basically Champions the rumble and Gangplank for a man for me biggest one obviously is going to be this do E4 goldenglue he has had his best games by far on that champion and what most teams that actually ban the rubble and left Gangplank up for honeycontinue to pick it and continue to win with it great he is Haiti a leader of all 15 players who have played on dignitas or EG so far this split the money is the man doing all the work type per second is his Lane make bang bang also time for second by the way at the top player not playing lower on the other side? There but regardless I hope they can pass know what's going on with this one has a fellows walked into 20. Suppose a little while ago full of air has only been played by a Viper so far has not had a game from Dar. So you can slightly expect stop laying there and then I think it would be a lock in for each she has played literally just Affiliates and Azrael every single game except for the one little weird Center game that they had other than that though one of these to Champion every single time that he does it again immediately locked in a belly or no questions asked with Azraeland it's very it's a very small just didn't read a guitar tab for out as far as that 80 karrie pick and he's been so consistent and caring with them it's very reliable obviously ashes amourjayda V Premier pic into a failure to both due to the rain to Bandon Lane but also a sharrow select easier to land on that champion there for the case there of course we are still in 10.14 movies out here are not in this past year so probably totally proviable next patch regardless to give that man some more spaced teeth as they still play his first fresh game of the split Phoenix Oriana Odyssey solid we know Jonathan play the sound of a should be just fine there okay been at the day then it's pretty easy for dig I think if if he don't try and grab that for Golden gluten in round one not only is it golden glue specialty but Zoe also does fight well until Oriana as far as most champions in Lane do with the range Advantage there so I thinktake to have an easy band hear the Rhythm band we already mentioned so all going according to plan so far for this champ select do you mean on Yelp Bowie and then Gangplank is the other big dick that's been great for Hootie that would be the easy priority for me we'll see if they have other plans here though there is the game play be alright meanwhile other side of Yugi following up your Ribbon band because you're probably still never mind how could they still looking at buy for the topside most people are only worried about his ribbon and if he can move Barbie curvy tonight from aphromoo things I've been harping on in the dick games they need to have dardoch on something that can force plays and aphromoo that can Forrest Gump play so I like the thresh deal from ege even though they did have to give up early taking this doughy they'll get another chance at it here I think that should be a no-brainer for them and they didout of Bard and threats to app remove should go a long way there maybe they'll go to aphromoo some sort of like Leona are Nautilus or something because games in a row they have had my stuff that cannot create ways and what are the games look like freak news best ya engage tools on the border Tulsa Shock Wave after it starts up but do you want to see Jonathan a little bit aggressive player would like to see a man strong jungle matchup of course the boulevard May well be his we're going to see Zoe not locked in for give gold and blue his third unique Champion across board games the galio come through easy. I like it every since they increase the range of Blitz book I feel like there's a lot more angles that you can go for it specially around the river she can join people over walls pretty easyplay with with a lot of people trying to make rotation to Scuttle crab and stuff and obviously I do mention it's pretty frequently picked into thresh because you know what GameStop in place and we will have to eat the cookie counter their graves picked up for Doc it's definite offensive jungle and they have plenty of specie elsewhere so they are going to flex that volibear to the top very strongly feel even after the attack speed nurse and of course the W nurse for only few jungle Camp so it doesn't hurt too much there I like the free eegee's save toppling for last leave the set Flex pickup Replacements Karen you are on Cinder hooktheory on this one can meal toppling to beat up Viper he must be confident in his full of air mass have iMovie novela bear is an incredibly, what are the most picked operators in Pro League of Legends you got to have it match of practice when he says don't worry Camille is the pic for me they threw a couple of bands by Rubblebucket Click by Jay-Z argon kamila's neck don't worry I got this and look at the engaged to writeshow me Chevy's to run forward and be the Galleria Target comes down from Camille you cannot get away from the galley or knock up go to glue can easily follow up and there was a bounce house ready to go for bang to just breathe fire on the back line as far as actual champion dive there's not a ton there's Volver Shockwave and that's kind of it otherwise I feel like being is fairly safe to do a bunch of damage the backlight key of a damaged cheerleader in the LCS he is going to be set up in the stamp and he almost always performs cuz I think that the initiative in the team fights is going to be huge in this game you know whoever is going to get your controllers in place first so that you can be the one with the blitzcrank pool or you can be the one delivering the Shockwave combo first that's going to go such a long way because like you're talking about we have some of the ideal Champion combination for those Big Y Mambo set up both teams have built Arsenal's to take on these Dragon fights so I think we're going to be in store for some some excitement this gamegoing to be a positive change from the last couple of of the games that you do fans have been crying about this one I I'm going to guarantee it right now just after 10 select this was going to be way better for a little bit slow off the start in the first one but they are going to look a whole lot better here I like to see it happen keep in mind on the lights are currently games out of playoffs there to do they have five games left to play Counting this one so do their key opponents they must at least pick up two wins if those other squads go 0 and 5 otherwise make it three make it 4 but they have to improve now if they have to pick up some wins in the very end of the split that is the road here for dignitas on the EEG side they are three games behind Team Liquid for a playoffsVice ability very difficult to make that runs but they can hope to do it otherwise he's going to be kind of stuck in that 326 section and we'll see you in the first round we are on a toothache and du Freak I really wanted that fly to I was talking earlier just like about extending the hook range for blitzcrank write something that's most solo queue games where there is a b c l o with a voice crack in it you can go to that Russian people often spend their support player in this defensive position that was the banana Bush where is daisa was sitting and you can hook them before they can react out of that midlane side brushed with new blitzcrank but I think they did not actually fire it off I was sitting here jumping eyes you are talking did the happening and we'll have to wait a little bit longer for the excitement I still hold true on my promise this one is going to be more excited than previous onesand we already had that Demonte versus dig Revenge but they've got dropped because of the big contract in money that was attached to keeping this player around and sent to Nene traded a way to Evil Genius has spent a small amount of time on the academy team in immediately has been moved into the LCS Squad he could not make thick pay him in cash but maybe he will be able to make them pay it was an LCS win that's a pretty good it's already been a good start for the new lineup on Evil Geniuses 2 and 1/2 record with hunie and gold and blue in the lineup and new chips are both them here and there for the game on this team and you got really pushing for gold and blue kind of shutting down the lane going to buy some of Phoenix's farm and there we go it'll most recent threat or Phoenix can just take some Auto Tags and keep the land in a bad spot show up on the wrong side of the plane on the way van shouldn't be too badyeah I like the move from Cincinnati to get Vision first before retreating down to the bottom Scuttle crab because it's pretty hard to kontest Graves on those If he if he tries to meet up and you start to use any abilities on a scholar craft first and you have nothing left to try and get that $0.05 go to those pushing them and what they look back and drive cuz he'll be careful exhausted on cleanse it away goes for the smoke screen and then Spirits here around as what we like that combo I got a credit app for Lisa okay sniper Laden with a gravity off him and my Boyz II Men Let me take that hook and trade it back good play my Afro Johnson could not talk to you until after I pee before it until it afro specifically this guy's been playing so much better in summer split then we had with a Teleport top the foursome off of the minion wave though early flash out of Viper because goldenglue is here that wave is getting denied and that is allfor the Viper will not on I-78 minions now all eight minions they're denied by the goldenglue teleport melee for his efforts baby to probably right before we saw screen but definitely a decent help or even though they don't get the Kill by force flashes down is teleport it was also expanded trying to get back there and of course as you mentioned to some out of that experience denied now there is a Camille one trick on European West where he's got really good informative match up videos for every matchup for Camilla comes out with one every day and even though I don't play top way I've been watching that he's just so good at explaining other little intricacies in every Camille matchup I haven't turned into the volibear wide but I recommend that you definitely go check it outthis time around he's he's gone for a grassroot almost always recommend going conqueror or press the attack Concord ghost so well for Camille obviously in melee melee matchup practice so much. Write this is Major Lane way easier and you can see us to tack up the grass on the minions you can go for your W Landis low plus to heal and even with a control you can get your crap Auto attacks off do I got some damage on the bottom side is. Excluding fudge making sure the pot leaves not getting dope anytime soon foot Comey I feel like a little bit I'm not trying to sell you out cuz obviously I've watched four of them wait for this is to be going to burn the cleanse away to come not just yet but still gets a lot of damage in cannot quite land to Prudhoe part of the punches being watched by a two-headed Health left buttock easy fight them is laying for the help our leader of the EG yeah I want for them just because you don't ask curious and I always like getting to know high rated Talent your insights but the volibear what I don't know if it was there or if it was super far down but they all have their little even your way straight on and stuff like that the orange one was pretty informative as well definitely recommend checking him out but again Dragon picked up here for thanks Karen actually are they going to do anything about it I control it inside the bit but I know they finish their recall so it is going to be E G Dragon no problem really far left over the bottle and he's like hey ya bass like I can come over but we have no idea what Ashton what's are doing all right cool we see or difficult sometimes right when you like okay we don't have vodka tour right now this could be tough but they had to go to the right and you can be just fine with that one soeg small gold good job back there for this one but otherwise you got to say Drake is going to feel good. Keeping up just finding and Spencer and I see first level six. This might takes down all of that you can feel really good about the chickens being is paper on the Move might get a red pustules well he's definitely going to get it I mean Phoenix has control over mid to push gold and blue under the tower so good pushier again another instance of laners. counter jungling Golden Goose China collapse I doubt whether he's got to be careful has flash but no old is there going to be a re-engagement hook might come down or play at least you can get a self write for the flash for the tots and a hook to make a little aggressive but they is eg kitten
look at those nights here where where they have like the same gender proximity and then you look at clothes aside as I call I have more kills assistant I've Morsi is betta 15 in the early game Guardian kind of are they very good that you're the game it is the 15 + where it gets better on the immortal side of snippy can use his incredible better experience with a patient Immortals I think he'll bounce back from this to a start that took down TSM just last week they can do good things here against Golden Gardens I could have been a 6 and 14 right now they are forced inside of playoffs top 8 make it The Mortals currently alone in Latin need to pick up with at least two to get into the playoffs yeah we'll see exactly how they're going to continue forward a but it has to be said that they have had a much better performances sense actually swapping in know that last game that we just sawreplay of against Golden Gardens that was the first time they played with this new roster they won that game they then went on to lose four straight but admittedly three of them were gets incredibly difficult opponents E90 l e g a wintzer event btsm with a platy how close they play TG clothes do they have been much more competitive I think down the stretch since swapping this team despite your being still tune forward this Rod Stewart on incredibly impressive record but they've been competitive with top teams and honestly in both its yell at me from actually winning and it was them making the mistake that actually cost in the game but something I want to talk a little bit about with the Guardians is no people talk a lot about their early game and it really can has been good but I also think part of the reason is many of those game they're drafting so heavily towards early game when you look at the early games in the split going through things like Natalie and Jason just like all in on winning Lane and that is where they are establishing sometimes these big gold leavesand you do as a result when you play those outcomes that are full early game you have to be able to close quickly right so your cough might get you a gold leaf it doesn't necessarily win you the game though and we seen that time again to where maybe you know you can get it if you could do that more and get over the line I think about him could have done that but yeah you get 25 35 minutes and will the compass now weaker so if you don't have to go anymore there's no coming back into it we are to the shop the quarterly pick on a Fella's FBI puts out of damage overall 31 has a damaged hair very high for a bot Lane it's 4% of what I asked me through no surprise or two coming through no surprise alarm is on take Duty quite a bit 33 gardenside May well be a top encounter could also be a chunk of a closer look forward to mate I think it is something that you know maybe a little bit nerve-racking for Mortals I do think they goGuardians and allow their wins has been due to side lamp late husband due to global play making on I think it's BF is one of the big enablers of that they looks good when they have the doctor and they look good with that the TF and just weighs kind of spread them a try to Happy's kind of obvious go buttons Immortals you're very obviously drafting 40 fighting for later stage of the game you have a double front line with trundle just read through any of the front liner the Golden Gardens does pick they're going to Banning away the Olaf the fall of beer is in Italy grazes take out the table so a lot of these kind of guitar picks for closer are getting banned away they may be trying to push him toward something like the least in that are comfortable giving bad over because clothes are has been one to off and pick you know Natalie Graves full off those types of Champions to really get those big early goal please send fan here in case that set isn't going into the jungle I think it's been the best look for closer so far in the LPS to split is on the lease and there's the bandAaron golden Guardian save a fair bit as Oriana and a zero off the table Corky's Zoe and syndra round up a chance that it's going to be played in the ALCS itself down go to go to the one final band to be a support to be intimate could still just be closer playing set jungle that is a possibility I'll be staying for five of the six Champions black cougars play this would have been banned the only one that's not actually band is binocular in which they did say again 59 you could function well with the TF so is a possibility yeah I like a massive Buffett n14 I was wondering when we're going to see it come through the bus to Jungle overall responded the bus to the lanes because there's a do they do well and a drop off on the Q but I like my listen to it you still directly if you can match that yourself that said it's going to have to be taughtit was getting played at all I have seen a possibility all right it's closer play Gangplank counter pick top of your business Alice's baby just saying like I wish we could pick this cuz a lot of different was pretty weak now so that is probably there at their main concern I mean you could have done something like what that jungle that place I was off I think that could have been if I answer cuz I was actually a totally good matchup into the warrant I think that's a very comfortable that that is actually where I would have liked to see them go if they wanted to go that route what time was top pick whatever support you want that goes jungle and there's 4 ultimate that are incredible to steal nowcomplete the name game for Silas the only thing missing is like mouth like mouth I didn't like the Phil Holy Grail of all this this is this the guy you like yeah unlucky Immortals I like this Insanity by the way has been getting really good damage numbers so far in the LCS I would like them on dammit baby car that is one of those I think this incredibly incredibly strong very good pick overall they've got Ash Morgan which is a great bottom Lane I think it completely screw the board wants to do kind of all times you got a lot of folks got a lot of sustained pushing down the lane with trundle for a Smithy we know he's going to that one you got or an engagement, which really solid I mean there's lots of ways for them to engage is also a lot of ways to make it easier to hit the skull shots to engage you have the wall of pain slope of the pillar slow those both sound very well for or Nolte as well as a Sheltie even binding to be very hard to dodge if you're on top of a trundle pillar lots of ways for them to start the fight I do think of your fighting front-to-back they should have the advantage it's going to be very difficult for some of the Champions actually fight through the carthus passive no carpet is charging in there with orn on top and and champions in that mix it becomes so difficult for your back line to access their backline I will say there is some kind of some kind of planet of the side and you got more. Who can black shield a gold card if he and sit on the other you can just bar don't your teammate when they go for the car this record in court that well cuz we know TF might want to pick it up at some point so get out make sure you time those probably but that should be doable with the coordination is a lot of fun stuff can happen here in this game I do like Gangplank we've seen Gangplank how to make a Resurgence here in the LCS he's been really solid overall we saw who have a bad early game into a masterful mid-to-late game last week CLG day you stood in got wrecked and then went great in the mid-to-late gate like GP does a lot there's a lot of little bar Jeep ETF like they're going to get in there pretty good fight but right as long as you're actually be able to slow down to the soul snowballing or not just go of every single Dragon you can play Sidelines with TF TF joining up with GP new GPU vaulting bot Lane then TF Alton Alton 242 you could stop these types of situations very effectively carthus does answer somewhat you know if DF old somewhere car this can all to help out that fight and try to swing in your favor a bit but I do think they're having a good ability to play the map it's is going to be perhaps harder to execute than one world has drafted yeah here we are on our last game of the day 6 Immortals 2 and 8 just on the outside of the playoff Four Winds right now is a place with hundred do you still having one to play Africa's well that could improve the five an immortal game to play must win at least to most likely to win three or four they got to go about fifty-fifty over the back half of the split if they want a plant that is my prediction here we'll see if they can do that it is an uphill call for them go to college right now are in position although as a Losi to make the difficult we'll see how they can do I think improving so if they have to walk back to the wait someone's going to face check them what sorry they're going to find hawkmoon versus CC more damage across close to me but low and they got to be respectful now cuz closer to help checking the potions Golden Gardens of course able to easily run back to their own side of the map no problem but there's a deep word for immortals and closer you don't have to recall here right but you're still at happy to be coming at you through the jungle is it going to start topside I think that's the answer you know that there's a ward left are you don't really know know if they're going to stay around and grass you so he doesn't mediately went out for the topside GP will help lecia Emmylou he should be fine. Machete so he wants the books on the Singletary can't obviously while you do start dating time for second goal but you know he can't even just do something like like blue and then Robin and red and be perfectly happy to try to recall off that you know maybe you have to boil your smile a little bit earlier but we'll see where he does decide to go that has taken on who wants to go to drop or not there will there be easier nice little hit their from hot to a pig give me something I have to burn to heal early so that was a close one there at the end of the day some of those FBI has to walk back to lay in The Mortals are crushing so far did I crave finding just the one binding be enough air from Jaco he has been such a good Morgana player throughout his career it's been awhile since he's brought it out but you know that they were one of the bottom Lance Vaccaro who is love playing we're going to Caitlin for example you hasn't answered his Ira Khan and things like this and they have always been very solid at that that one Vine not only forces FBI back to base take your to and Apollo is 13 cold to poop so pretty good about that so I will stay and help and help scaling of a squishy before that change anyway he's actually getting doran's blade help for free so always get a life skill item for a crushing ruin takes you have lifesteal you have they sell coolers just 453 think the only riskier is is what happening now if you get Yankees versus unhealthy are in Halo has no flash notification go off at once again closer finds ways to make the early game go well the jungle different standing about laying is Apollo a taco or wanting that to be too but a good gang cure comes through from closer to start the Doctor Who how to find the latch on the wall didn't matter if they're just random down and I'm not sure if it would have made any difference for Apollo Taxi heal from Ruth b c everything made the judgement call that he wasn't getting out either way just decided to hold on to that he also accepting the death he's returning back to make sure the hawk will work it out but thankfully for him even on farm and the kill went to the sets you're going to be happier about that than if it went the way of your fellows I'm ready for the game State 500 gold lead to Golden Gardens I will say they have to Champions who print money the other pastimes to go to the Monte and Hans were going to have inflated gold values vary slightly golden okay this is what team is playing better than winning because they're doing more in this case go to grab the gold leave because their Champions are bounced around just printing free money so it will lie a little too few Yep this is one of those things that you say it like that that's the key part is that it's balance around having having extra gold right though you know being being up under gold on the TF when your family even is more like saying you're kind of even in power but either way they doing that first blood in her to be happy about that know we'll see how much is for an alarm to pick up in the Top Lane but it was good good early Laney face you're from the orange unless you really miss play on GP it can be pretty difficult for orange punish you whatsoever and if you can't punish GP in the really early roles then it's pretty tough when she pees on shein and start getting some of them for the bear where do you completely control that way it's definitely the case right here and whatever you want to take the recall he is easily got Sheen money this point in time they see we ever was going to have around 1,300 gold from all the farming roles we can see who's came through for the Monte extra couple of rings came through for Insanity on their first three calls see how long they want to wait until the first things do come through on to Big Lots of burn through this man a fool eat the bear oh there it looks pretty heavily damaged down he's going to get us how far back regardless so it doesn't do too much that's okay can discredit back and forth as the business clear there waves in V1 see a difference here in the mid lane 4748 plays on the map Insanity just wants to sit here and farm and he wants to keep the TF locked under his turret so if you're able to do that on the spot just got out of the all but one more cute actually would probably meant you could die there would have been a lot closer for sure the month did Russia Mercury traits we has the
with treats in the lineup I like the swaddle up yeah yeah I couldn't see how she's can perform over a larger sample size of games and if he did get that TV to kill in his debut yesterday that's obviously feeling really good if they can pick up another win Eire know they are kind of keeping Pace a little bit more with of the top of the standings as and liquid you know we'll be within Striking Distance if it can grab a win here today but likewise on the other side has been struggling to be honest I haven't been able to string together or really any consistency throughout those are kind of leader half of their games here it's kind of surprising for because I feel like we talked about flyquest it was always their consistency that was praised most liked that was what we look at as as the team's greatest strength is not they were able to know play these kind of slower Styles games that they were so good at to finding the power of evil with so reliable and as a resultI love or maybe not in peak level of some of the other teams that are absolute best but they are always a really really solid Squat and they feel like they have lost some of that consistency perhaps trying to adjust their place I was in the current meta trying to play more aggressively and at times failing in doing so you know allowing themselves to throw away leaves at 4 what games do the course we have the lineup back up here is Blacklist has put wild turtle back in there were one of them if they were four and four with mashed turtle is back here at Ashton Place and Academy we back on this one here and grab Center for themselves as they have seen as the 421w showed up at Citra came earlier is it split so I wouldn't be surprised anymore to see Devils play something turn on Mark's been down there but I also wouldn't be surprised to see in place andfrom split to yell it was rough always work out for them there but to be honest here this is a champion that he will play a lot by now I do think that it was something that you can add to it before he always hasn't had the most except outside of marksman but he has been able to pick up like every men immarksman ever throughout his career right you know maybe Draven or something like that not the dream has always been more friends anyway and it kind of one of those teenage pics of that he will be able to pick it up and see what kind of animal are there going to bring hear play Wukong skin Academy so it could be that stand of Wukong volume that they're looking towards I could be something with him for me or even things like send it TK have obviously worked a fair bit in the past week and play kind of more of those standards towels there too but I always want to see if you're going to have a farming Santa some I formed of DPS elsewhere and I do think that this is already shaping up to be a draft that I can get behind Oriana yes people always think about the birdplay Rihanna's High DPS especially later in the game Olaf obviously a champion that can build full damage and really add a lot of specially in those early midi instrument is this is something that you can be supported with this an ultimate Euro La flying in Saint Al's comes across allow you the extra tank unit and the added damage a coming through in a flex deduct more you know who it does feel like a pretty well crafted for 3 on the other side quest draft I think looking quite good also volunteer respect you to go junggle a very steady pick here to Ken's graph with Olaf front damage rating is pretty good there is a strong leader and Ash in a power from the center here in the tundra and of course I Do I Do by the way I want to give Credit Unit I like the idea of early Senate and then waitwith a farmer has a lot of good luck the other half of that polish have like 19 possibilities all the TSM side we met and fresh going to get rid of some support for the ash down there, as well, again there was a lot that can be played the TSM I took him to save toppling for last I think they round outfought laying here and then give broken play the counter picked as you were mentioning that they have DPS in another roll to the support of senna you know about the retainer Top Lane I do think that they were lacking a little bit in the engage right now it was kind of just Olaf run at you and that's your engage so I think is fine allowedto round out their bottom line based on the picture from flyquest what are the problems that sometimes happens when you do go to the Senna plus military South lot Lanes is that your opponent's can then pick a specific to match up that is really heavily favored we already had ashes a dominant later and then you pick something like a rain support that is really advantageous gets whatever to get them would go for you can really get in a hole in that bottom line We Are Kari can't farm at all. So they want to play this I think a little bit more than I do think it could be looked at as a picoway to that is something that obviously cordage a double if you play a lot of a Pantheon Sapori here I do believe yeah it's possible that they're going to put some crazy but it should be Pantheon the Portwood teen pop out a little bit more people going press the attack obviously you camp rock that 3 hit combo very quickly for the bonus damage increases the damage of Ashton a lot of Cece and set up across the board here I do think the internet options to go through all three lanes Renekton with the sun pant down with a stunKendra Scott of the week like you can pretty much go anywhere so it is 3 bra more the defense of option if Pantheon books to engage on your Santa the brahmas there to try to block the follow-up from the Sandra from the ash as far as that is coming through I'm going to go with that more defensive Auctioneer okay well very large out there by that you can absolutely rely on a speaker has been hit-and-miss please had some very good games but if we do see warrior build I expect it really take over on the West Side the wild turtle is back in the ignore ignore has been a very strong performer this year he's got the pantheon support that's going to be fun cuz a lot of really good engage out of here right Pantheon Global Center for across the map if you Lance has done the arrow is guaranteed by the way if you really need to but this is going to be very excited to watch for the reduction of course grab for solo at the top is going to report this game till I got to see that Warren was I think 95% of the actual top are there said okayreactants give me counterpick brutalize this guy full of jungle was the pretty pic of this drafts of flyquest I think our boys has a lot of really really strong aggressive plays and every lane and I would say that in the style of games where the Joker has a lot of options become so important for TSM because oftentimes you know you have some Lanes where it's like okay yeah sure you could go there but you're not really expecting it you know people that don't have any cactuses with your playing with an Ezreal laying or whatever all the times you know your kind of going to be sitting back and not a second the jungle play there allows one of your lanes play with little bit more freedom in this case you don't really have that luxury on TSM you have got to be scared of the Jungle showing up in any single rain gear so it does mean now that you have done was going to do a really really good job of actually tracking santorin throughout the entire game making sure that they're well aware of where he could be us so that the Lanes on the other side the map to play more aggressively in and not just seat control across the boardanswer the question can be a course that could be kind of brush I believe in you know we could have been there but there is a war that is over that wall is bought from LFO is is probably about as strong as you possibly get the speaker's you still cannot immediately there is a fight return to the ALCS in the 400s from TSM but because they knew they got spotted they swept out toward you're allowing your opponents to have to prepare for that if you checked into santorin wild turtle and ignore her we're already on the Red Bluff View windows but because there's actually them getting spotted they know they're spotted and then as you're going to double if you're actually getting the words because moving forward and just absolutely gets burst down to Turin very intelligently started Q there for the stunt to be able to walk him up for his teammates in in TSM just was not work on that and date I think that once you're spotted you either have to continue to move forward as a SWOT is a brush or you just have to say oh that sucks it didn't work time to go back to my blue buff and they have since you didn't either we could speak it kept going for resting kept backing off Jacob over first blood and Flash yeah read as the other three of TSM we're literally attacking awarded that is rough stuff word for a ward as DSM go so you know it's the flight for a horse so early Lane pressure here doesn't surprise me at all if there's no way Santa really deserves Lane pressure when she's the 80 carry that I was just too busy knocking down mittens with takes awhile for you so okay there's a girl before they can go fight for the first Deport I love this push to waive support runs and Wards heater blew up or drop isn't very first and we had to push my bottom late is XSport even deeper there you can see how things are going very very far for his Ward actually spots at way farther back near the Grumps start near near where the woke movement is because they want a blue bugs that Olaf had to do this is worse than The King and I don't even completely blame him like half the first step was the recipe of his fault happen is on him for going when they're heading towards that one is just like okay they did call bought missing but are you really not allowed to go for your own blue stuff write it and that's that's a situation you have to evaluate because I think that speaker was expecting but that was just in his day for a car to to word it out in her ass right you know if you see someone missing but you're not that concerned us to be a full commitment but that does she have three buff into Des on speaker this earlier and I talked about how when you're playing these Santa, there is a lot of important enough to damage as the Santa alone to really make it work right like you're not going to punch through the Volver in the Renekton quickly by yourself you need Olaf you need the Oriana to be having good games versus down 10 see us getting zoned out like it at your juggler is just screwed he's basically half Farm you got three boxes died twice in four minutes if the cat is really concerning not just for the visual before the overall team composition how it's going to function here. Lolita course we're still here as well so that is a wave yet to be fine but still feel like a leaf doublelift out about Elizabeth damage but very easily play around this Pantheon feeling good that you're going to prom and broken blood is actually a game if it's a scrim u u u f f the game and you go next like this is a 2000 gold eat at 5 minutes with a composition that is is focused more on on early and they came out with say on TSM side I don't believe that they have enough tools to to make a left at like 1 benign carry so I don't think you know you can you can make this look like the kind of UV style games or watch it takes over later there are obviously lots of opportunities over to get them to come back but they are at incredible disadvantage early on and I'm one of the few kind of Saving Grace is here as is bleeding so it's pretty well down in the bottom side and that they will be able to grab this dragons those are cool things working for them but very concerning start for TSM okay do you send you got to work back and almost 2,000 gold deficit with a mountain drink to your name and in front of Drake spawn in about 5 minutes we'll see if it's possible as you mentioned yes there is a Libra TT the bottom like some of that it's the fact that turns to a couple of recalls off of the kiltie got an event to get to complete some Farm but it is done with a small farm lead I was kind of gold leaf first let us go to make sure that's not really the case but stop when fighting back and forth. I believe got a me when does he was still in the middle of Bella's breakfast all of his six first Broken Blade comfortable enough to keep battling back of the wave get Broken Blade wants to try to push this out I Look to reset this speaker is up there and he's sick now so if someone gets too aggressive there is no opportunity to maybe get something done but it does seem like there's some some kind of pains around that area so they're not really confident to do it even if a backbend coming through from PS are you a good step in the Bog Bulger could be up there and is as can be spotted now though so we'll see if there is any sort of the class or just give me a little tonight for apps Ben is getting jumped back and forth by POA Centric Lasley considered a strong counter to the Oriana overall so yeah he's going to kill this matchup going to retain at least 10 CS difference if you're sincere about the wave and we'll see as Pardeeville just every single time by the way we're at the wave go make a top with a pretend you might be invaded make the ball in afraid that you might come down the river is it okay to pipeworks go to That's Amore. Very slowly and it's always very very good on that for a while so pretty nice attack speed there. There's no TP on on anyone except Broken Blade so there's no way I can respond to this so it is probably already did Rose Kennedy coming in will see how they start this up a lot of the Waves as they turn off the turret there was no possible way you survive it was effortless and the gold comes over so I can assist for power bi I want to know if your son is out of math Easy Auto command couple of slows they're really good chunk Pearson 4th to go to pay for me we used to be but I got you killed it again Crystal now but it'll do if you're just so squishy at that point where did you just one more time your accent is out of man that they know he didn't have flash so
booties with Envy powering up right you had like a thin a marksman you have no hyper carries actually boost up with a stolen, so I just think that he'd be in a really drafted for the yesterday and they got run over pretty hard shell so I will see if they can if they can make something look a little bit different here today because I I do agree honey have had much higher highs than Kumo of course if he hasn't left his career he can absolutely dominate in the Top Lane on his pics though I want to see him get a shot at doing that has game because I think the draft was a was a hard it's draft if you look at things that's leave the league in bot laners or most importantly damage share meaning of EG relies on bangs to be the damage Perry he's gives you his welder to give up for Success on him to be to carry and it put it on farming Centerplay with with wrong with a Karma with with supports kind of all across the floor and that was the comp I think this cough work because of the begin do that kind of performance go to who's Ariana is not that she and I think the draft was wrong for each I want to see if that kind of look and so I can I give him a pass because of things that the cop was bad and I want to see what I can do with this one here thank you can go if you want to go Priscilla Lane, you can go alongside super aggressive dominant Yonkers right like you can do it with great so you can do with Olaf like there was multiple ways there is to make those competitions work I don't think they went for any of them unfortunately for a Jeep but they do have bang back on a hard carry Skellington fighter Gear with you fellows very quick picks you're coming through from Cloud 9 it's kind of been a bit of their signature lately they seem to really quicklyUgg booties Rumble over his way A GPU know his is another pic that people really do know who need for but not going to be flying that against someone like licorice I do think it would be pretty ill-advised and liquor it hasn't been going through a lot of foreign lately either so I just don't see him really finding a kind of matchup that he might want to be able to bring that out right away on to act as birth of the split but obviously you very very strong Champion more black police enforce good as well and Zoe in her time and again more and more recently as the safe light pigment liner to round out your first set of 6 to build a bear can go either way so through that ends up going and Cloud 9 have to wait and figure out what their last week's going to be for the second phase of vana lot of headaches looking for dusty rose going to go yeah you know the blank is one of the things that people often talked about it being kind of dangerous for Zoe but obviously that band that previously so I could be too worried Stendra can be a pretty good one into the Zoe overall to such a state champion know when you are able to do the Palo Alto Urgent Care from anyway just back off and has keep your distance obviously a lot of food bility given with that mood speed increasing spell teeth are too pretty much always playing felt it feels like these days on the do it all so it doesn't even work Everly's play it at Freddy's offensively on the way of Licorice and he has really been liking Kate that as well as the Wukong and set are his most played I will see if they want to try to continue targeting some of those because you've been away from the more difficult for the GP event he does have more of a chance of actually kind of bring that in my Barclays come through bartash just saw that lane just the game of go into ketosis sign that nearly Lenny face but they certainly one of the game overall is after how to spell a barber for these Vulcans time to show this one Cloud 9 is leaving toppling for a laugh when people said they should have done against hundred when Papa maybe don't let Top Lane you know get the counter pick and Crush you as we saw with Sunday to Cloud9 taken that left this thing okay with what you got and he plays Rumble he plays set that was with Champions and we'll see if you bring something out like this one is the karma is gone as well the rumbles kind of mentioned what is it going to be as yes Alistair got a cool stuff on pulverize in pain for the blind pick you up Hoodie yeah what is it this is the first time we've seen it this flick I can't remember actually else are coming through it all and yeah checking on the campus of pics this is the first Alice are pick this split and it is going to be the rest of these are incredibly difficult to go up against that being said if you would stand it loosen often does fall off pretty hard at compared to somebody's going to jail but set would be much more of a say Fick looking more towards if you buy more towards those later stages of the game and that pussy feels relieved in can still pick on someone like U P worth noting that booty still has not picked up a win Xin Academy is it busy bee caves he just lose both of those eyes most play was The Rumble in to have a 75% win rate on that so your dad is going to buy that has been banned away but we'll see if you can pick up his first win on GP this split is a has always been Champion associated with him in one of the best players on it in the league for a for a long time I just like the Vulcan Lucian have her as their XT what's the world together last year and he's like hey Julio I think it was kind of in your career was playing Lucian against TSM yes you are that one goes I always I always enjoy that I like bringing back the old player stories old teammates old jokes about players on the seafood eat very very good Vulcan outstanding in his own right and going to be if I went to see EG yes a bad loss yesterday we know there still a fairly good team I'm expecting them to end this split on a positive when rape Cloud 9 they went 17-1 in the spring split they lost only one game in playoffs I don't see a reason why scene I cannot just keep that same record over here and summer 8 + 0 run to end out the split-pea they can do it here as we are on the ramp for a second game of the day I'm already way more excited for this easy game them I was for the one yesterday after the draft I think that they're playing worth of their strength GP is nice in that you know it gives junio where he can kind of a pop off and you can carry but it's also not something that requires your attention constantly knows it's not something that is a lane counter right it's it's more about the scaling and he can just kind of sat with Dan and try to play that up by himself spent here and it's going to keep more options as a result filtering that since she going PTA we have been seeing you no more kind of variety I think with some of the volibear that ruined some people going phase Rush some people going towards you know even like conqueror various things obviously more in the silver Lanes but PTA has been getting picked a less but it is still very very strong for the one do you want to get to lease in early I can make your traits really effective there and obviously is the added benefit of that bonus to damage coming through in team fights for your teammate so now we're going to see what the jungle starts look like it's bought size for both junglers leashless in both cases here is well worth noting that the nurse to Jungle full of DW only heels for half on Jungle camp and the other side of it is that his base attacks because that about 5% so we is a slower clear and a less healthy clear this is been pretty substantial volibear jungle probably still his best role but brought down a fair bit of liquor straight to it he doesn't easterly damage the grass still goes on but it is actually afelius playing lethal Tempo that is is really quite uncommon these days I feel like conquerors by far the most common and even after that the PTA is is I think a little bit more common Del Sol more for a kind of a late game room here it doesn't give you that much benefit in in the lane itself but you can sometimes uses a sprocket off a spell and then try to push in the wave he added attack speed and maybe that's the strategy here from Bank looking last actually interacted more just keep that shove or you poked with a cue properly Tempo and then just hard push the wave be careful the fourth level, Dallas-Fort can be threatening Hazel could always go to bed before Verizon to with Aftershock you wrote back on the Alfred that point so then into the wave comes back pops the guardian Spence Karen I think might know what level should be up to see him coming through as leverage was the other way around and this is hilarious. Right bottom jungle where is he where is he I know he come get my T-Mobile iPad so it should be a double shuttle for fence Garrett pushing up in the midline to so that is is the benefit here energy does kind of get escorted out is that room from goldenglue is rewarded by having that settle on both sides in a nap and they know that booty is really the only one have to be worried about a gank eventually right now. So he can try to play a little bit around that and so far so good for people Geniuses right you got pushing in most cases who knee is bleeding just fine of his licorice licorice pick up pretty early recall to grab refillable in cloth armor we should make his Lane pretty comfortable who wants to wait till Gene if it all possible which is really close to him right now 3 call comes through and should be comfortable just going to knock down waves at that point that she doesn't go all the way it looks like he was afraid of what he had a man in his lungs hurt but Mana rabiee play Christian Few Good Hits are the Bears going to land not really do any party at 1/2 HP with Lady face starts not not the worse though at least because he did get it and okay trade back on Blue course I thought I could have been a lot worse than it actually was actually had a burial place behind him where he was keeping into which licorice couldn't really run past to kill us so that allows you to threaten a t z Trail Chainz I think that's kind of wood to sueded licorice a little bit from pushing forward so that's a nice horse out there from who need to have that in place and make sure that Ray didn't go to too poorly but is is falling behind in farming evidence that is somewhat expected to be pressured in we'll see how much is he going to pick up at is torrid Outlet not really pushing down since I control Ward was able to make it look for the cake but ultimately nothing happening on the Cloud 9 side very very small Fiesta episode presented. But they so basically just betting zero Matt Ladyface I've never gotten for a play this man could have negative and region labeled be any different yeah I mean honestly if it's pretty dangerous to go in as All Star against these Tetra Lane in a pretty little three you're not going to try to engage at all you really do need all three spells and that you didn't post that there's so much slowing between the ass and this bar that if you go forward and it's not like an instant kill or something you're trying to retreat out of their Alastair doesn't really have a lot of ability to actually escaped he's going to be looking for this wrong now since we could be engaged on a is Russia's lose feed those look what a Flash and wrist that nisky still actually the east of it down so just give it only it'll flash or cleanse get away but they don't wanna breathe cooldowns didn't take a nap and knock him down still control Ward and give three to Gold over the Golden glue who is up three Bs in this Lane you look at how EG putting in STL yesterday glue as a result has the worst average goal difference at 10th in the league at -1000 at 10 minutes he got absolutely slammed by Jensen yesterday this Lane I was he doing a whole lot better and some of that you can give him a pass on regardless EG play the fairly close game Cloud 9 up and gold over although very slightly as it's a big top lately for licorice that we're really dance from uni will take us out whatsoever but this key is here I think you're pretty dead no matter what he has orange is black licorice he's on top of the birth of punched the old man is going to be afraid killed the very least Golden Globe you know takes one for the team if he pees in house. Is an auto away from Taxi Cab Place follow your heart break if I ever get away their you think he will come back in and kill off puni puni should have just counted His blessings that he didn't die of the way than compact actually Farm it up instead that who need my settings the Killer Instinct he's going for more and it's going to cause me to lose to Ace probably losing a fair bit of this one he already lost a full wave at furlough is extra chasing over 959 do end up as a result still coming out ahead on that play but there was a lot of hesitation on that. I've honestly it felt like they really kind of work sure if they wanted to still go through with it once the Alton was dropped when she became through you know what you really just want to start the day off with licorice Alton him into the wall by half of men you have a guaranteed Q the sun everything falls up the ultimate from cintra but they just text so many purchase know from licorice you're walking over it and no one was really starting it up so it just felt like there was split cons or something there from Cloud 9 but then who he has a child life are passive the flashes in for it but the Steve Garvey really came back up there for blauer giving him enough help to get over the wall and to come back into the execute weiand a kind of setup for the easy CC out of licorice it allows that kill to come through a furnace get the very start of it also I think it's more Miss play there for him and the day though fairly close game difference not absurd but I got to say for the back at the split Cloud9 they were totally down 1500 Sport in the game it's a routine Part 9 definitely but this is a this is also that the aftermath of it is so not only did junio verse Jason not going to kill he lost muscle weighs and guess what happens when the way it means it pushes away from you your jugular is now not on the top side there jungler is the wave is Frozen on you so you're going to lose a lot more minions off of it but I just had that first two ways that he actually lost a minis are going to be tonight to the Tower and licorice Kansas Tennessee freeze this will see if he wants to push for some reason but I would say you just hold it with your jugular up on this topside and soon he just actually it is Tony tried to push this
of course we are here I am free cuz they'll is there and feel she is facing a dignitas and I'm excited to see what happens vlg what they were tied for second early on there still 5 and 5 which is over the Lord has over four times vipers KDA in the LCS right now I'm obviously also in my tire went right so they can do right at the base. For a swimming sperm adult baby diapers really been improving you know maybe they feel like he picks up their issues is going to offer them something against these team and we have heard the nlss talking about the fact that the LG don't we focus on topside at all maybe to your house wants to do without Focus graphite I think by will be suited better for that it's all speculation but at the end of the day we will find out what is going to happen there. They did have a good starta but to be fair you know their losses are all against kind of the top teams right so it is just had a schedule waited more towards the second half you know when you look at their three straight losses to actually close up first round robin with TLT attempting I write that it to the top three teams DSM you arguably third or whatever or depending on what your current power rankings are things are shifting around a lot but we three of the hardest teams in the league be lost through all of them are fairly unsurprisingly so I do think that they they've been relatively par for the course you know that they were beating team kind of below them in the standings are losing teams above them in the standings so we'll see if they can actually do make more of a surge in the second half try to challenge those games that are sitting Atop A like this ish play Steve are in middle of the pack being consistently beating as you mentioned teams are better than them which I'm curious if they think that's because they kept the sameroster from Spring split bar in the steps to confirm last week and you will find 5 teen boys to go around 9 and 9:00 or 10:00 and 8 which is obviously like two or three times as good as well but is that good enough for them do they want to retire I look for that world spot everyone says yes but is that realistic I'm kind of curious what's in their mind either way as we go further into the draft Ashley coming atop CR80 Carrie picked up going over to Johnson we have seen set games from bike rack for the top played in fact is shampoo in the LCS is fully you know top claim damage Focus fighter so we made me dig at you mentioned play around topside Viper open think could also go to Doc theoretically could go to Port but I don't really expected you paired alongside match would make that much sense but I do actually really love the pic I think it's fully blind pickable doesn't really have any Mastiffs that I think are on Sanibel that can actually deal with it in that bottom Lane they help out jungle and it puts you when you are against you know I really kind of jungle focused style draft which I think a lot of the gravesScott's really are you know they often become about Ken Gray Zeki bully around your jungler can he be no counter jungling in your face constantly getting advantages in that way and act and help you. That quite a bit using hot shot to scout out when you don't know where the grace is so you're done working avoid them if they already to 72 matchup definitely case could be a lot of very very good obviously I think I can stay on that one is Over Yonder is locked in for Phoenix 3 Midland band support with Ashley Zoe's Hatfield you grab her right away so it is filled you haven't you blind pick their mid later dignitas get the opportunity to counter pick for toppling leaving that set at the flex be hard-pressed to have either stolen have we not know it will be interesting to see what they can actually show up then we take the bus is coming off of the two a week as we were talking about earlier was very impressive but one of the things that peopledetracting from that was both wins world Phoenix on this year right and we need to see him perform on more champions from that he didn't look as drawing on the Morgana and and definitely did not have a good game Auntie F so now bring you another new Champion here for him in the LCS will be if he can actually have a stronger game I do always loved it the Oriana paired with some sort of hard engaged and I wonder if we're going to get that something may be like you know a nautilus or even at work on or just some sort of way to actually have that go button to set up the Shockwave how can often make it much more effective I think it's actually against someone like do Eli crave Champions acne with that hard engage you can vary off and lock down and can be really really powerful pairing with the only hard to get deported after always played this split is Leona otherwise he's a lot of threats aren't they can engage but they're not I put my body in Champions typically so Bard is the second most it goes for it yet again so that is the one right set can a champion is and thenwell within the Shockwave but that is the only good Target on dig right now we'll see what it ends up being as last remain flexible in top jungle we haven't seen dark play NLCS yet we know he can play it throws not that hard to learn sat dongle and so will see that was filled you must have guitar player knowing it might be sent might be something else and going to say yeah enjoy the orang I'm pretty surprised by the Cannon Dam from CLG to be honest cuz when steak has been malphite you know that that is a matchup that you would want to play Canon 220 to me that didn't actually signify that they were looking to play the champion Canon also what is totally fine for Warren it's something that you can kind of withstanding the early game and it's become more relevant later on so surprised by that but the Canon Dan would suggest they think that the Top Lane has yet to be picked for Viper I do think that bharatiya knows though it is not taxable to me and then Shockwave off of me you can set up in a similar way with the ultimate you know if you hit an ultimate on to Zoe on her grave than on any of these carries Phoenixtimer 12 Contessa ball on top of them while they are in the safest and in time the Shockwave right as they're coming out of that bar at altamed and I can be quite effective yeah definitely can't be good be fun to see if that coordination works out give or take the toss that you mention it as they all sealed he does not play around top play true it is on an island and what is island of a Viper on the Raven we saw it before they could not get the win against the others are saying we're going to try this one again and this time around I think it's a lot more successful Viper is notably an amazing Rhythm player and this is Beth Champion by far-right you know all of all of my first best game you think of our on the ribbon he's had some incredible carry performances and I do like the substitution if this is your plan going forward if you really want to focus if it is specifically targeted towards a team that doesn't like to play around Top Lane now the question to me becomes if you're sealed you can you adapt right can you prevent the snowball up on that top side where it is not always the easiest Champion to actually snowball on but it mean if if he is constantly getting focused consoling getting to be one know he is going to be put in a bad situation and that's going to potentially allow a Viper on this room to take over the game so we have to see Ken weekly help to protect ruin up there and they shut down this ribbon because room from behind is pretty worthless generally that the LCS level especially when you're looking at some of these carries which are pretty difficult actually take down you know you have obviously have a Grace who can become relatively Tanki Israel with the death dance ice-born type build you know a lot of these guys are going to be able to itemize pretty effectively against that ribbon so you generally have to play from head yeah I will say though in watching vipers games on riven's so far I haven't seen him need to dominate Lane to be absurdly effective in teamfights the man has at least 20,000 games on Riven at this point in his League of Legends career that means he will find those open to mid-game he will find the Byzantine fight and he'll be equal to the Bourne and then do three times the crowd control of damage in the team fight the damage sure you expect but like the man will find a 4-person flash cunoc up and you be like guess she's in the cage tank now I do not want to understate this he has been having a hard time donating else yes yes even doing very well in Academy either he's got a negative goal-difference there as well but on the rivet it just hits different the man will find opening in mid-to-late game into my eyes are always going to be on this for the play Make Em expecting at least one highlight reel clip in this game from him will it be enough to beat CLG I do not know but it's going to be a fun game to watch all the same and I like to call out of of the the key flash right you know because I do think that ribbon when it comes to the inviting Riven with flashes is basically a separate champion from women without Flash in a room without flashing a team fight as really going to struggle to actually ever get on top of these carries to walk through the Nautilus in the orne you know with with the amount of damage that is actually required to be able to break down some of these carries you have to get on top of them instantly before you are getting your knock down yourself so your timing a flash becomes incredibly important against the Revenant I do think that you know that was one of the areas that and we saw Kumo fall short on when he actually went to the Revenant think the lady face went great you know the coordinated well with the jungalow they pull up Dives but it is much more difficult to actually team fight on Riven I think that is where you can often see kind of those highlight plays come out from the true truven one-trick style player the people look so many damn thing and they can land the combos perfectly factually first one down is going as expected blue bus routes were both sides Wiggly leashless where is Johnson. Faraci team players and give Darla Cadillacs of time there so early start is going to be nice for such a great lady bipolar II by the white chunks gets down but look that is what you do on level 1 you drop some help pack. Is a phoenix take the most absurd trade you would like it's okay you got 350 Health waiting right behind you yes it hurts the early landing on Barge if you want to learn a second point in queue at level three major without magical journey but end of the day it is going to allow Phoenix to feel a lot more comfortable in that mid-length that is really nice but honestly you know I don't think that's a trade you want to take with those help back there or not it was a pretty poor afraid I'll be down his boss I did you get level 2 first then I forgot to be careful now you know it is one of those situations where it's like a it's essentially a potion and 1/2 righty 2004 like 7075 on the setup that they do actually take with it the runes and masteries a charge but you know what does she have the extra potion that have which is very very valuable you still want to try to have the extended trades are chipping away at someone a pole vaulter is actually just playing crafting potions a very likely Time Warp tonic to hear and he's going to have a lot of sustained so I will see if he needs to actually keep the wave away from is Tourette because in those types of situations get advantage of those extra Phelps Ryan you need to keep them from pushing even fully and resetting otherwise you know it's not going to matter if you have a couple more potions in the bag when he goes back to base spell thief seminar use right there. Otherwise yeah I know big problem there early gold lie cuz Lane put it in those size right now you got ruin of the very big c s Lee but look at that it's 15 million for life or to kill what even drop it in the mail if they are Easy Auto couple accused he's using ketchup in farm no problem maybe once in the middle and got really nearby as well as why not to bring the flash gets away from the little bit of the damage does FTP to burgundy. Too much difficulty was able to avoid the sleep you know that would have been a death sentence if he did actually got tagged with it but still that is a great gang from Sea algae it's not like we believe that any time waiting around you just going to walk straight through mid lane on his way to work spot and shut it shut up and listen or sometime get the flash out they didn't expend any Summoners whatsoever so I think looking very good for this graves in the early stages you can actually put Kleenex even further behind it gives Graves more abilities play crest of flame or ability to invade we could put Bellfort and then control that midline in be there as backup if you actually need them and so far the lanes are all equal basically identical CS across all roles that stop playing scraps briefly fees it damage of a viper gets grasped back but does he is a damaged over to ruin all the same as do you recall and TP came through for Phoenix recall and TP comes to purple halter he's got spell books are going to be a real Summoner before too terribly long anyway and very similar buys on both sides boot portable doran's Ring versus a lot of really posting that crap thing on the football field. What are the premier room choices in Pro play you can see that ribbon is actually just having to go back to base do with the Wavin you know he didn't actually want to risk fully pushing it in the way of will eventually come back toward them because it was over closer to ruin our backup faster over there and eventually push back but you could see you know if he stays around you are in that kind of position because any time as a top laner wood right outside of your opponent's Detroit you're struggling to get that way pushed in your so simple the gangster so acceptable to roane's and my room is going to have to respect the potential of that but is able to get the fault if your Smite was used early play wiggly wiggly lose the big chicken. Krabs it flashes the flares and thanks very much that's mine good sleep on a phoenix as is reasonable damage the man is coming to listen or the out of Mana you think I'm a very hard time admitting he's been keeping up on a farm for the health bar betrays how close that lane is going to do that this is kind of problematic now though that he is actually out of Mana he can stay around now but you could be losing a lot of them sure he would like to try to wait around as long as he can to recall on a Canon waves we lose his less if possible but he has a passport for the first time second time when you go back to face know if you base that A4 timing you're just losing those menu for falling behind experience then it does allow me to get a lot harder to last hit some of the minions under Tower when you don't have any manner when you're completely reliant on just Auto attacks you know there are some minions are going to be awkward help mountsin and they can be finished with all those girls are allowed in a bid for the magical Journeys already there 6 a.m. get back to Lane suppressor put the fear of 6 and 1 both want the damage of level 6 set which is not going to be in a whole lot get some damn it you know what something down there but it's not going to be in a whole terribly time good thing for a coz that weighs the boob has happened
and trying to set them up for more success but it's not what he's been through the gate Champions if you keep going down the list might be want to throw like echo or or rise or something in there EG have the Bandit Twisted Fate themselves which is one of these flip pushing options always like to keep open someone three-run possibilities for later in the game and their ability to play Sidelines as a as an Avenue for victoryand see what comes through I think the bands can open up very quickly cure a Zorn gets off the table trying to get rid of Tanks here for days we know Kumo has been a very good early in toddler he's one of the most improved player split Davis parish and Academy obviously at least we saw that game yesterday was not very good thing. You're just what I think it's a good choice there is well but yeah I think there is a lot of room can be a very thing left up more and more over off their through be going away from the Azrael combo with basil suppose play Champion to split so we're seeing a lot of like I like it Target band that sings U players are showing that they play at that and I want to see if we are going to follow it up with is it is it going to be more of the open up there you go it's just the karma kind of take away some of this before its speed and shielding geology they have had priority on Jungle picks for weekly in the pastkoala bears a great Flex big does ridiculously strong this is still 1013 by the way so hasn't even gotten the attack Speed Turf yet and we just completely it does so much that you never have to reveal if it's going a top or jungle until the very end of your Champion Select provide reliable tank that's in CC no matter where it goes and it does allow the opportunity for somebody grab the most picked jungler of both Wiggly and Spence Darren and buy more than I should say the v-neck camp in the pool so I'll actually locked in here just to guarantee it is clearly Comfort Revolt side and look it up bigly I went and do too much of a stats last week in ready for this game really is arguably the most selfless jungle in the LCS he has absolutely Rock Bottom Cas chair at 50 minutes and Beyond he can have a ton of farm and just as look y'all take my camps get your golden come up on football throw a stick say I will you know do something else like the weatherhave been probably above-average CS year and I went looked at Rouen he's also I'm coming from a high against monster trying to get out to the late early dinner will be the first one to lock in the mid laner for our midlane featured matchup lining the year and the hover already I like it Ford azuki looks like the echo locked in here this is one of the Champions iconic campus kind of mentioned at the very beginning that you associate with him trying to have a sassy Nation all in Kill predator on the mid-light match up and having options for playing side length later on yeah I dig this may just ask him if it gets really is forte and it looks really good here we got his birth Vlog games but yesterday going to get it for a second game of this place the day I love seeing players play the champion at Styles they are good ata big fan I want to see him take over face love seeing that overall meanwhile pobelter to be his first as your game of this but he is what a big bear tooth filled with quite good yesterday couldn't have to win but teleport fly away though we are into Kobe you talk about why an aggressive bottling for sale do the Kapil reply calypte is locked in that could definitely be there and I'm curious what we can see how to seal team do with a Cutlass the ultimate maybe we ccog boxing on like Nautilus or something for Smoothie it's something that he is used a lot for Point click initiation for the team and helps out so much with your volibear trying to find those in cages where you step in front of people if you can have the Nautilus Plus Calista combo that is just tremendous amount of Cece and connectorshinder the Play Making of echo later into the game as well yeah it make you second-guess how early you you want to use your ultimate cuz the whole play pattern for him is to Decay trying to dive bomb into the back line and get your your full combo off onto back on either is here or Calista before getting locked out if you get hit with all these different forms of species it's going to really reduce that picks value and kind of force him to play sideline only well if you're going to be easy not go for takeaway here they're going for the simple prom to protect back line without that has really need the help of any of the weather lets you get some very safe Frontline here to block things off and CLG can move around to locking in the morgue well absolutely destroys Robin the match up even if you fail to black black shield the stun it's impossible to screw up at any realistic scenario Slaughter what you wantyou completely sealed you should have walked over the bottom line and bake Point comes through as a blind picked off later actually like this game because your matchup but you already know that the enemy jungle is trundle and it's not the best at Tower diving early on so I actually think they should be okay regardless of what baby. Freak this is how we got to Chase Bank to the covers basic na dog with the Riven bring it back. I mean honestly I just been picking a chocolate blah blah blah I think about killing the Gangplank early on trying to chop him.so I actually do want to see spend staring problem in up there what are the stats with both of these teams is at both smoothie and Zazzle are number two and number three in Duo proximity so the supports room very little for both of these teams are both of them are above 75% of the first 15 minutes spent with their Lane Partners so it's much more on just the jungle influencing those matchups and if you can split the matchup Riven vs. Gangplank allow Kumo to actually make use of this counterpick and Elevate him this is going to be one of the few times Wetmore one of the teams again puts their top winner in the spotlight and really tries to play off that counter pick for red side well top it was a lot of the reason why they would impact took over that one on Chene as a kind of pic into now we get the ribbon-cutter pic into Gangplank and I'll see if they can replicate that success of a second-place team team liquidwhat is nclb the middle of pack right here at 5 and 5 going to have to put to go last time around but I want to see how much higher this team can go I do have hope for the squad e g mean while hoping to rekindle That Glory from Spring and whatever skills you have to get there alright super excited see we get a riveted ALCS and it's actually not at the hands of Viper it's in the hands of another one of the younger players going to keep a quick eye on that both junglers look like they are going to start on the bottom side so like ice and think it is going to be on them to influence the matchup fence Karen trundle very easy top to bottom to top side clear volunteers should win the fight over Scuttle crab and so it means that we can get there a little bit quicker and depends on the shove I would assume I was here as soon as the weather gets a level two level one is here doesn't get much of gold level two should be fine on keeping pressure on does UK and help Wiggly in establishing control over the top Lane the other things are seeing the jungle is here right try to kite the cancer to make scampi sauce Spencer and backed up in autos for Instagram the movement to that it saves one second and I can't there's no downside. But you're not slow you just ate it once I found the clear has a bit later flight back and forth to do cake it's a good sucking a pole vaulter and they took their supposed to rain pretty effectively they're pulled out there as you can tell what kind of focus on the minions of get the shove which is Yuki gets another proc off and I got to point out that she has way more sustaining Pope does to regular health potions is 3 and 1/2 back three sacks of corrupting is more Paducah and just like just turns through his health and Mana punch to go and look at it would be a kill already hope I have to recall early in this Lane and we're highlighting exactly why this is a signature champion at 4 to zukey he has the killer mentality electrocute Echo continually looking in for the trades get to the triple crock on the passive been staring though he's actually rushing instead of going to the Scuttle crab going for the cake with a big minion wave Taylor good slow a lot of damage knock up day is finally flashes but they're going to have an update with Red Sox the shop is on his first Blood path right top side and already top difference record head right up there for Kubo and set him up right we clean out a surprise get a son get some damage buddy I got the assists per day is one sin for a q that does nothing to build up their of the the Epic Odyssey of the river Fight 3 topside starts out with a little surprised boo let's get to know each rate after the Red Bluff into the game got two days now they went straight past this big can a minion wave pillar really nicely place they get the flies out of days and you still able to chase him down feed benefits of ribbon there with all the mobility in the champion and getting the killed in to Kuma's hand is so big and then continuing to try and punish the Gangplank big kill going to go over this Lane is pretty doomed Christine what end in an obvious counterpick match up where they need to cap it and they have the possibilities here to straight out of champ select Spence Karen repeat gang stuff that you saw how close it was with days being able to use that they kill on low health and firing back if if there is more pressure up there if there is Capricorn possibility your maybe they could actually turn that one around but with who does SNAP teleport down and cold start for Dave's he is really hurting yeah I will say this is not too bad current level difference that actually sequel for now as well I'm sure there's an XP Dell that we don't see it yet and levels themselves because tuba has almost always down please fight as well just pushed enforces to Ricky's off and losing Pharma to go to the fight it's obviously worth it but he is not bothering him as hard as you might expect those pills because the CF is getting dropped disposal also weekly technically at level leave there because he had counter juggled on the bottom side but Dragon picked up by ET in answer here so they'll be super happy with the infernal bonus stats nice little fruits there for the early stages of the game and since Karen has all the rest of the little chance to go back through and clear Wiggly only took away the ground but we're going to go down to the Atlanta Zoo Kay ultimate leaks but how exciting the early fighting has been at 4:30 back to lay with the boots of speed him keep up in farmed is it okay going to make his own recall on TV back in with some extra items himself so there will be a momentary I put farmwise these two players are pretty much neck-and-neck and he's going to get a window to move now as well these these 30-second Windows where you get to force a recall and and have priority over roaming from mid are so big you see pulled up they're actually canceled his recall he was trying to get off a second recall their clutches UK continually keeping up the pressure you just goes through these trades over and over continually honking out pulled out there keeping the pressure up in midlane even though the Cs is even it is Zhu Zhu que constantly forcing on him all right before your wave a slow pushing away from you there is fog of war in the river here comes the hard and Gage Miller is on Jesus how's the Way to the Top lyrics Stay Alive right I mean junglers down there there's a good roaming down there CLG know they're strong side of map would be bottom side and e g to sending all resources constantly camping the top side and camping this Gangplank CLG they take away the blue buff so there's some sort of answer but it looks like it's going to stop at that they don't wants to defend the crop available for weight loss uw's but not lose the Grump over to get to take that feels but yeah I'm a little sad that the counter play is what time does XP on speed on quickly but the game status fill 1000 up for EG in the Blues have traded back anyway maybe with a teepee up a topside it really wasn't tenable but I feel like maybe should have been dope enough to put him off the tour get the plates or something I mean it's really cool to see easy putting so many resources and so much faith in their youngest player
champion and him merely winning Lane vs ornn and having The Stand United Team Liquid the first 20 minutes of the entire game yesterday versus CLG and I feel like that strategy versus golden Guardians 18 that fully Embraces the mid lane roaming with Demonte trying to play around closer invading out of the jungler if Team Liquid are allowed to get Global Bike shed that's a perfect defense to try and counter the golden Guardian style fashion averus FBI Vera specials in open pretty long known as a family has been very good and that's the hover already feed liquid trying to deny some of those marks pain from him put him down to a baby and is real or a Calypso or something else and of course that shame as you mentioned not Bantu way probably not stolen by concert is going to be full of God is not able to fly exactly what they've been doing a lot of reasons and again in factHauser into orange to be able to have a very easy Lane phase where you can also shove it up and have Lain pressure in addition to being able to use the globals definitely be there the bottom land of Israel, I feel like it's so annoying to deal with defensive poke long-range to CSE super offensive now we've got basically woke up Landing Modpack use on tuna paleo slain just kind of the way that you want to play the early game so I think golden Guardians to invest in some pretty good Mouse overs from Team liquid soap some flavorful pics but I doubt they're going to lock you in you know this way in or anything like that and it's just good to be aboard the classic late-game scaling combination of Australia suorin but they threw in elyson in the mix up again for braxas most comfortable on and all of League of LegendsI'm looking at the golden Guardians Drax if it did not have to grab Azrael on a second pic right there they chose to get it despite seeing the evelio so they were trying to rush down to get the lease and they could have gotten that first pic do not to its death at wait and see what else can come through if they're not going to kind of pick top link they're not going to go for a blind Midland covered by the band both had very good early game little girl doing I would say yes better uncle just died of Rockledge and have play making tools all game locked and the thing that was talking about event golden Guardian further investing in this strategy I think they they've completely got it here with waiting on their jungle pick up are the reason you want to pick as you do when you don't have to and you're not rushing for a first pic is looking for what team liquid show first if you have foreign land on top side and a Bellows on bottom. Both of them blinded as far as matchups go from the golden Guardian standpoint you can invest very heavily in early game favorite answersat least it does have Mobility Advantage rate UPS man ever meet up you can taste them off of dective and at least it has to get tricky and try and no usable Billy the ski lift or Flop King's first but by seeing the rock the lock in beforehand to Golden Guardians now half that's very heavy Poclain bottom line with an Olaf jungle that can go down there and control early Dragon make a try and win souls before Team Liquid versus orange pretty good scaling their unique champion in Hens game of Orange Grove mordekaiser X1 of pics to Champion pools incredibly wide and I think you have weight gain with your back bite marks with a big tank up. But we've got a counterfeit top length we're going to free form u4 golden tail give me one of the carries I think Hunter has been a lot better this Flippin lastit's still a dominant man has stepped up it's a big factor how cold it better to me in this place is Orrin which is one of the very few matchups that kale actually get picked in competitive League of Legends right now is because you can get your tail past the early stages where she's basically a fledgling of a champion and get your excited to get to your extra range for the champion and I wanted to see more team putting their top winners Disney's carry positions so coming off of a Sunday Camille pick this is really exciting the trend that were not saying in North American League of Legends I like the little bit of spite their added by Team Liquid solute are there at LeBlanc pick and it's immediately countered with Saturday to fold counter in Lane face trying to AOE the wave and get your Wave Control and use your teleport to get right back to the Wayne after first purchase but later onsee the LeBlanc and put a stop to any type of hope that you tried to go in on your name for a second game in a road diesel block flying under right now to get off scot-free pack go to be loaded stronger as you mentioned go to the match up at all so that means it's one of those lights off of clothes are doing Ward hotcakes and knocking people in and then you had the Monday following up being a second and more often. It was closer leading the charge. Lee walking some people until it down two axes but the the hard engage not really only on damontay here will I not be as real and kale to be a kind of another threatening backlighting Pulte liquid into them but I always am going to be a little bit concerned when there's not you know the most the easiest engaged without their own lysandra can sometimes be too little when you get a chance of going to be dedicated disciple and an impact Advanced recovery needs to so I normally and fully onwith that but there's one thing here when you have a kale on an Olaf team it also turns the olop into another option for the late game which usually falls off very heavily if if the guys can get closer some early money having the kale later also brings that extra looks to your team comp where the Olaf gets to charge it as a juggernaut and start the fight as well with knowing that have that long immunity to create chaos within the enemy team and that's why I'm very excited to see this this mostly LPL and lck pick where we see Calles picked into a horn and try to scale from the easy early Lane that go against against it into seeing what Golden Gardens can actually do because it gives you multiple options you can keep fight with it you can also play your side length later with it very effectively jungle pathing right now you're going to see solo starts in the blue buff for both drunk lose your baby or it comes down at least a little bit but not required both used junglersvery good at taking their own camps and standing up by themselves means a dual lanes are going to be sitting there at the Lane right away if they want to do FBI who he could have pulled us into a freak and if there was Elisha M. Pease you like this yes. Me to Casey Randstad clothes are easy going to solve the blue goes on Prop afterwards if I could just a little bit if you want to want to point out to lunch answer is becoming more and more the count pick up here it's guaranteed golden coming out to expose yourself to try to help make you get the vote for the golden come and makes it very safe and easy yeah I'm a huge fan of starting out and thank you as you can in support role supposed to because of what I planned it I get autofill that I need to her as much help as I could possibly get but I still think the Azrael karma is going to have pretty good folk advantage and should be able to know her ass tactical Encore JJ pretty well during Elaine Paige crush them under turret and set up for these possible Olaf dragon that we're looking for a cute does Miss there so that's a nice quote on windownot for courtagen tactical try and do something about but since it's level two for the golden Guardians no possible rebuttal and so far perfect CS4 FBI 1 million drop by tactical open the case when you're against the more aggressive of the two lanes going to have for today help knock them out of the melees of going to be just fine overall is an Oculus without much difficulty and Dominion go down back and forth and it's just the early plane crash Denali send are they good to know for certain there were no T4 is he could have done a red start Solo or a blue start solo so his actual location should be entirely Unknown by Golden Gardens would just be a guess there is some of the respect they have to pay because broxah could beat any Lane right now the game plan for Golden Guardians is very clear when Oak Demonte actually are going to have to try and leave around the minions good job there by 10 to get me the full combo and chain off behind minions in getting a big person Demonte but that's the game plan here because I really like looking at the early stage of the golden Guardians are trying to accomplish herewatch free one-v-one time for kale vs on if your kale does not get interrupted early and gets to scale up to the ascendancy range bonuses then didn't your goal is really complete for the top side and it allows closer to transition off of getting safety and vision for on Sir into fat bottom side poke into Dragon Focus for them so you see his priority really high on clearing up to the top side to get Scuttle crab and popping the scryers bloom which reveals that since the ground was already taken they now can assume the location of rocks that even though they didn't see him directly or you can kind of extrapolate and know that he has to have clear towards the bottom half and alert FBI and who he took the weight on a closes arrivalI think it's like a lens once again though. So slightly down in farm with more minutes for impact to kill so it's really late for Kayla never really is there putting clothes back and forth on Sat really talked about this one but hopefully not going to get out of this one impact health and Mana for a little bit low on so much simpler baby wants to recall before too terribly long the TV back into Lane maybe on his first you know bit of Triforce her first bit of racially or something like that either way Quizlet going down to wait there for Monte small midlane leave here for Jensen farmwise overall but a close gameyeah number one golfer how to get to level 6 first so you really get start playing bottom side they do get pushed in so cord to 10 tactical taking their window opening at see what car did they can do with its bar if you could get any sort of vision he acted in a movie there newborn baby this one right here this is one this the last non-canon the wave like a du-rag on a hard shove one wave and then recall without having to bring TP which Appleton have disk is the way if you spend all your mana on a Wii stuff down we're seeing clearly stated last week. So those would like as not give me the timer where I think pretty close to BSR time like if Taco Bell sitting well and I believe he was this would be the way of your last hit graphite yes or than recall backhand Lane and Castle going to end up missing that opportunity I think that is an unanswered by Azrael so this feels like a small missed opportunity that fit I'm sure he has a reason why and we might be a fly out here but you would want to push that we've been recalled yeah and it can't be affecting them with scales objective here having to use your early teleport to be able to bridge yourself until your levels be fixed because I was in for Gayle you get to your 525 Auto attack range where you then actually start to be able to do something versus the Oren and first by Berserker grief and mediate teleport back for hanser so the question becomes do we diverge and have monster walking back to Lane because of the necessity for our to me for impact walk back because of the necessity for haunted have to teleport there and that's a sun to queue winning half help call JJ with the invade their deep into enemy jungle they do catch them off Jensen's LeBlanc able to capitalize on it that is First Blood phone is over to Lovelock we could throw a wrench into the thing for both plans on Sidelines if you start to have Jensen actually roaming up in and trying to get those pills on the other two side land everything could slip for the golden Guardians Team Liquid get the objective afterwards as well very nice early control of the vision on Dragon in the river plus remember there's a Teleport discrepancy during this whole time when you have that the confidence of your top line or being able to join you can die very deep into the enemy jungle knowing that there is going to be an extra resource for you to use the court JJ proksa combining their to go to set up the kill for Jensen you know they get the gold of the ideal place as well and cordage a right back out onto the math with rocks are right behind him looking to get some more support jungle roaming action you mentioned earlier that pop when was going to report for Golden Gardens in troll Hunter is safe closer has several times now make sure he's gotten top scorer xtra-vision and make the room stop or the gate for the top from Brock said that much more difficult to answer has to go to safely farm with desert breeze it will run away from date the consumers the ideal first item on that you're really really am a champion as well so yeah he's going to be pretty safe up there closer wants to go back in they can BBQ on Brock's light is up for one or not because they were afraid of what the world might be there was nothing that hey MIT is missing didn't know they could have stolen that they could have taken the mid lane without much difficulty sponsor should knock down to Florida and if they can crash that Harold 300 ultimately be too on this flight going to make it hard for Jensen still looking around but can I have the keys to the Orioles down three Chase golden Guardians back now they're turning around there with the supports roaming over they pull off blanket defensively got to pick the gold is pretty much equal between the team across teams probably feels a bit equal up to the K-Love great on one side but it's hella failures or on the other honestly I was getting pretty excited I wanted them to fight that as well because even without lysandra ultimate if you type back for your cool down on W then you have a kale ultimate and Demonte can try and W root Jackson when he goes in for the pope and if you have kale Ulta
Creations that you can only really do by playing the game by being in these matches and we are already now into champ select is giving absolute Banger Cloud9 and TSM this weekend classic they had the academy they want both of those so TSM looking to take him down here again what would be the most important match 90 n round robin tomorrow yes the early drafted than Siri Siri rap OK I am actually wondering is this Wukong bought is this actual events or or Vulcan playing at you know as as the farming Wukong that is a strategy that I've actually been seeing uphas popped up a little bit in Pro I do believe but I've seen it until a few quite a lot as kind of distracting Center we're going to have a senegence playing the two types of force out rule for adding picking you do have the roof on his power farming and in grabbing all of that gold and you know really it can be pretty powerful strategy of course this could just be Wukong top could even be Wukong jungle article that out scoped out of the flexibility is there a horse's year will be near Blaine we know now it's going to be Misty's azir vs. your sins LeBlanc you would think given their kind of typical roles said it would almost be reversed as known much more for getting out of Lane for invading with his jungler for really kind of playing this up-tempo style and is generally is not that unless your plan is just a AFK push in the lane and allow you're going to go today that way and it was actually pulling off that when we saw a clip of him in the heightthis one but going to get gate number two on either of those roles has like incredibly high band presents you know it is still the most banned by far in the world right now and it's almost always band on right side so it's back to Cloud 9 left it up here not only did they play a game did not get pant they didn't first pic is a very clearly wanted to get this over to DSM I see if that was actually the last time I remember there is getting through picks Advanced but they were the ones giving it over 30 Mason going for a blitzkrieg Calista and trying to punish you in that way so I'm really curious to see what cloud 9 strategy is going to be to try to punish this Veracan blue be paired with the bars that does mean to be a really strong lady who owe a having the double ranged characters down there can be very punishing if you want to send Wukong down to that bottom Lane as the farmer can be pretty difficult as a melee Champion into double range to be able to pick up a lot of farm without just getting for rats completely out of the lane well we'll see what comes through here at set is locked in and I can't be certain which one's going where but yeah I mean set to go junggle top or bot Lane was what is going to be set at the heart of the pork and pot line BBQ number down there with sent over there I will say that Center did get box to Lasting scent like play Katy Carrie sent it to get stronger if you packed because we see the occasional player play it I feel like the forecast for Hugo spectral sickle but we'll do the rest of Champions are at is going to be one of those Champions guzzling because Orin is I want to pay the top later for my prediction is born being flexed around and that'll probably just be depended upon this matchup I do think that mordekaiser you know obviously is a pretty good match up into both but particularly difficult for torn so that could Ornstein bought the farm but with the current raids what was this way we won't speculate but it's really very very strong are the Santa has a good amount of her ass is trying to create face for this week on the farm you're all in is actually quite strong there to you know if you can land the center of roof and into the knock up there from the Wukong you all had potential is pretty powerful obviously the Senate able to give support and added damage with the ultimate for the week on allowing him to dive more deeply with the ultimate Shields there also and it is a little more of that kind of team fight style of composition here from Cloud 9 which I guess is is less difficult from them and they have been more picking like roaming and skirmishing and winning lanes and all this sort of stuff so I'm going to be really curious to see how this goes because I do see ways that TSM can actually win this I think that they have an advantageous Lane toppling I think they have an advantageous play mid lane actually give them Pantry winning Lanes here whether or not they can execute on that is a different story but I mean you have your verus barred against the Wukong is trying to farm that's actually really really difficult in the early stages LeBlanc Unit has the ability to it suitably out a z or potentially in the early game you know he can be a organ 50 50 matchup if the if there's your kind of just out push do bong soon as you can to gate that a bit more guys are definitely favorite so this is interesting and we already know that kind of club band plays their bottling weak side of of the players in this game the bottom two and goal difference at 10 or Vulcan and then Sven beneath that they are they are very typically behind at 10 minutes the other three on cloud nine go ahead obviously TSM very strong a lot of latency the real Cloud 9 flip is between 10 and 15 is when they get all the money when you start giving up and playing Team fight that's a really big really big games ranked for C9 but I agree the early Lance are going to be very interesting we know licorice tend to be super down up the top sites put second place in gold Sprint at 10 and not top link is broken plate on the other side has the two best performing top laners an early lead David they're going head-to-head and imagined as you say is going to be Broken Blade favorite your liking all these lines here and we know it is an outstanding player through as well as a speaker is I think the second jungler and goal difference of of players have played more than like four games there is a lot of good stuff here on the TSM side I expect the early games look for the explosive I think the team fights to be really interesting because as ear as to do so much the heavy lifting in the overall team flight status Wukong not the same persistent damage that you're going to get out of a verus for example so very intrigued as to get where these team comps move around as time goes on as a group up as to get the TM Fly and see what the players loaded up and ready to hit the rip is finally time to jump in to Cloud 9 versus TSM hello and welcome to summoner's Rift been giving the thumbs-up because we have to match of the week here Cloud9 and TSM a battle between the most dominant team announced his history and the winningest team in LCS history TSM got all those Stars the Jersey Brothers trophies they hoisted the number two team in the LCS right now would have only two teams to beat Cloud Nine all year hoping to bring it back again it's going to be a really exciting game in a such different styles of compositions coming out for the team because he actually on both sides so move around the map to match aggression you know if there are any games for me and you have to be very wary of those types of plays and minor thing but this is actually yorkson getting a deep Ward there you can just start the distortion on the Block you start over the dragon ball drop that work is very safe. Actually looked at those types of plays because you can just double you right back over that wall it is worth noting I did look up some of the Wukong Bots that so it is actually 5 and 2 and pro play across the major reason so has been fairly successful obviously fairly small sample size know of just those seven games but is already doing quite well yeah of course we got to see Matt Lyons work out twice as well dropping said it would come into various Lanes so other teams have gone for this exact sort of setup for you do any of the match up there is 10 to be very frail or the game has a lot of range but doesn't tend to matter when you can close the gap on Wukong he's so hoping to infuse baby low durability got a grasp on set up really really nice as well of course you're cute by Plies on hit you can like whacking they did once wait 3 seconds then Q through and you poke them Plus at graspop so your your book is very good there it is for example if he's going to go for that I've been seeing which is just grass Senate and it's it's full-on like tank like frozen Mallet Rush with grass and you're just playing to be incredibly annoying to essentially instead of having a glacial augment you replace that with the Frozen Mallet you apply the clothes with that you're constantly stacking up grass for the bonus no permits Health that you are getting and and yet to talk about the terrorist versus the Wukong you know various Bard your job down enough that they can't look for an online because the all-in is very fragile especially Post 6 as you said he's very frail doesn't have in a tremendous amount of Mobility out of the all-in with Santa and Wukong can look very very good but if it were calling is poked out too heavily before it gets the opportunity will guess what you can't help and that's kind of what these two lanes are going to be looking to do it you're very a typical bot Lane you can expect the Wukong send it to be behind that they should be losing as far as Farm know that is very much so expected but I can't look for kids later I have Elderberry to the mid lane Mesquite high can a little bit too far left hand slide I don't know if they thought that they didn't I don't think it looks like they might not have another pick it up to go towards the Scuttle so suddenly First Advantage comes then puts a storm down blocks away and easy swiping through a play buy speak and grab that one takes a camp out there lies the total Florida cross tattoo done with your supposed to get to trade with electrocute he wants it back and get that for himself and that is what that looks like because you're not able to really reply to that a very very well done their metal trades infancy what kind of a bill he will go here we've been seeing more diverting bills from the Azure some people are going last chapter and then just sitting on that pretty much forever you know going to Nashua to some people are then even just skipping the Lost chapter all together saying I don't need that man I can actually just go doran's ring in a dark seal and then go straight towards my nasher's and death cap in the interest in these types of Morty pipe powerful items so very smart word if he has no problem there going to be a vulcan's going to knock down the next to take the following for 18 goalie camp but that will let the camp despawn and level have to go to the gym later on still is next be taking my speaker well done to him check out the top link temporarily is partly to licorice Broken Blade is going to whack him once real quick not sure if he got the the craft off in time and overall the far pretty good for liquor stuff like that you're not really looking to to fight the mordekaiser too much unless you can kind of Pokemon down if he makes too many mistakes were just about withstanding the onslaught getting as much pain as possible getting to your forged items where you start to really become very very useful ever clean those device and noticed that the Vulcan is actually the one playing the Santa know I wouldn't have been surprised it was actually the opposite a lot of people when you do other family center actually put your your standard parking player on that because they are so comfortable saying any of this Marksman Sol Champion generally speaking then would probably spend with the playlist I'm playing melee Champions and bulking and now it would be engaged just the wrong timing on that motor set up differently regardless though still for the double thumbs up a Vulcan 5% so him and misky obviously went at it pretty heavily but why is he wasn't sure if he was going to be able to avoid that sun or not to go commit The Flash in nicely done there they'll get the pee pee out of spend it is going to be a Sheen early on to very aggressive option he clearly is looking for that first you're not feeling afraid of this matchup and no will be going for or the most burst out of his Triforce instead of going for something like the stage or even write speed to try to play it a little bit more speed run good poker cannot get away from doublelift hail of arrows either so already spent at 1/2 HP and he couldn't have afforded to buy the full fee you know $200 no difference you could still go lots of Ruby Crystal and be like yeah you know I want the stats now so don't I know you know it's it's very clear what they want to do what would you see that it's like I want to kill you right that is a reason you by The Who by the genes the same things and only when you see no really isn't and stuff go for a defective items they are looking more for you all in less about just being able to get through this list is up quite a bit a farm and they actually kind of had held the wave in a pretty nicely it real quick out now to work and because he's keeping much later he's going to have the better by I will have more gold there so you know a lot of longswords sumle Fallon
O'Reilly this short cooldown for cloud nine and it actually was not successful utilized one single time that game that's what this team has been applauded for hire walk-in tournament they are very well-coordinated they are also very good individual players they also need to start getting their individual credit they have shown up very big here in the lock and turn them in now on red side though they do probably go with the same standard bands does D'Elia follow hear the maybe we do have fudge I'm going into you or Duty or or just plain front lines with some sort of hard and Kate Spade purse details of ID expect a a top-line change for that though I expect one here as well I didn't really like orange booty for fudge it was one of his worst performing championsBraves was I think similarly lackluster so maybe it really is going to Orem UT down the line I'm not sure either way though yeah I think whatever has been good and I am curious what this crap is going to look like because we talked about fudge replacing licorice we talk about first replacing Misty Bells keep mine is taking over as head coach and instead of rebirth for Crappie engage base tile for game 2 or game 3 and we still were not really sold it and they're cops have looked that good you know this is a coaching changes bring a recycling first team head coach has been around the block for a while but there still a draft I feel and it's kind of execution and with the players it one of things I had felt the payoff is still much disengagement previously weave with no car got to be so aggressive do for work a thing we're getting going to get at least some of the pieces and it's similar look here Lulu also locked in to provethat's the port can be a normal Cloud 9 coffee doesn't make it a tight back and she'll top that doesn't need you to have those supportive no Tennessee Tech to come from and you can have the heart come from somewhere else you own a and who deer have very good tools that you can't use as we saw a little bit of extra something to get there probably from the top play it again we're building this up all the way towards the end of the draft for that take care of meanwhile hundred thieves are flying picking their eight socks with the security 9 that they can throw band number four and five towards fudge the further Whittle this down a bunch more pics of caixa for FBI Hillary a bit of folk if you really need it but honestly there's a strength is that you could always follow through on your team's Hart engaged one of his biggest ranks as you are always going to be there putting out the damage on the priority targets already been locked downrescue team music all broken hearts brawl controls the bottom Lane seeing the Lulu here that has been honestly gave the entire season so far on Moonstone seraphine was still be highest damage performer on his team not going through any of the damage build season he's still out for the most this is been trying to kind of one benign cuz he's not going to help with him right now as therapy jumper cables well yeah he was good on both those Champion so he has been the most consistent carry for cloud nine ever have been our players that's far for tonight so those are the two players getting 100% of those two positions and walking in the Alistar would be huge I thinkyou should lock this hovering over it takes it away from the cloud nine side because Lulu they've already shown that willing to flex it around definitely could be of course wanting to watch for is where it does go we do the 8 drop the Top when out of town but he's going to leave Midland for last year galio is still an optimist and been through that shape has outstanding tahm kench going to be alongside it not huge pumpkin fan personally Lulu is going Top Lane still and it means once again we only really have one strong silent for cloud nine with begin comes around it is going to be interesting and already you know people are going to theorize what went on and on about 9th Grimes last week that that led to this kind of look for 5 for the team looks like he is on Lulu Duty once again at least it's a start does overall in the weather right now but that's provide still that Dave D is for a decently well to with other male a supports and honestly I'm kind of looking at this Lilia ticket in New York is that be one of the most frustrating matchups Fort root beer because Lily at that have so much control if she comes to the fight having previously stacked up active if not take me to your can't get on top especially with the face red and blue flashing and flashing on top you can stay with in the rain and get inside the q's if she doesn't have her passive preseason stacked up you can get the taste out if you can't though then then it actually turns into she keeps you at range stove for frustrating long with a swirl seats float with the burn on you constantly with the ques so it's going to have to be a pick and choose your moment here for bladder on Udyr and again you expect very heavy PVE Focus especially early on from this Champion the biggest ranks for Luger have been near the adaptation of tiger attack speed bump on top of all the Phoenix bus that really get the most out of those Phoenix box not your Phoenix Phoenix bear at 4 even kill at level four was not enough to win the game for cloud nine they needed even more we are adrift once again been here on bot Lane Center and across the border 80 karrie soon as we have seen so far in 11.2 it's been cracking Slayer it's been attack speed scaling setting for attack bees killing overall got a lot better there is more beneficial interactive practice there cuz you're cute will give you one of the stacks and a outstanding it is a competitive build as far as you're concerned and it's the one that the pros are using I don't think you have to go but you certainly can and it's fine also really really don't like changes to the to the wind up there since the attack speed is going to help him and got that you know slight buff as well let's take a look at the starts though we did a flapper swapping over you drop your ward you can see this up in the river topside just over the pixel brush to see if there is any sort of variation in closers path going aggressively swapping over to the sweeper is pretty important for your early on because he's definitely one of the Champions that does like doing the full power clear into tank as we saw last time around it swapping over to sweeper gives you the conference make sure you're not over first drink at Ward if the if your lane or hasn't tracked it ideally they can they can alert you to hold present if you haven't been swapping over there laying as much but it it's it's definitely a champion like we do really does like using flash for Gangster Leon because you have such a strong farming fallback pattern but it is a doran's shield Vulcan invent is this the rats are getting the spectral sickle out there so probably not going to stay or something after all it's going to be in a baby amount of money or something but they are just getting her ass down generation for not last hitting that was one of the more significant even though we have still been seeing it primarily a t carry you spawn more of the souls from Minions that you that you do not last it and you get more gold out of them 1203 right now they're after all we're not done we have to go potty stop and go away from bladder gets away from her eyes good to see that one coming I think he may come over the wall and so that was on Reflux really want to be bottom side because she not supposed to go to the trip they do there is the risk of Lily starting topside and going down there that's nice passing by blabber even losing that much critically critically could have lost them all of the early game for clock on a flapper doesn't correctly flash that guys there that is just a complete collapse for them so very very good fight for him but you've been whittling down someday super heavily on the Loup Loup summer on keeping them in Lanes pressure Done Dirt our losses yes lobotomist the play last night before spoken The Flash out as well send her ass out from his van but clothes are going back in for the start of the map he's already gotten all the six Camp done right that's what you got there and is the tower. If they'll be getting done right here but it will be much safer recall on Focus I was just a consideration for cruggs but you know it's help or coming back from some date doesn't want to stick around too long meanwhile closer a very long time. On bottom side so it was canceled by blabber when you see the enemy jungler down bottom that teleport all the sudden doesn't mean that much he was previously re calling cuz he was worried about the reset from closer plus help from some day into defending their frogs but with the reveal down bottom you see on the mini-map fullkrug counter jungle there for this is the cost for foreclosure sticking around for the second interaction on bottom side of the map labber will correctly you microwave both those camps given the xtra-vision approve play by his bottom Lane and goes back to his own full clear so we are going to see an XP and gold leaf from Lab rats eat differently does in the jungle certainly you sense to always be able to himself the lead and it has to carry that into Cloud 9 mid game is over closer towards then he is just out of that would have been a kilt and everything but it looks like that skill shot instead of wave Dallas will catch up to you still got to be careful of round 2 in all this the control we're not going to be much of course wanted to get Vision with that one to see someone and the day was going to be much and there's just going to be the wave clear top side and bought Land staying alive is supposed to go back to the Jungle just because that is that is it should be a predicted Play Right Thurr you have bladder communicating oh hey we see the not reset from closer on the bottom side so I'm taking his full tops I can't be Scruggs and rapper Raptors if you don't see after the reset closer showing himself towards mid he has to be on his bottom side camps clearing his wolves into more bottom side pressure and they make that choice to fight but is not happen I get better way to you if he finds to spare just picking up a new kid in town freak fudge is the youngest player in the ALCS fully transformed over who he actually can't get away Cox and slow and throws up alot of damage dealt but can you waive dying to the tour de force looking was part of that chase down and so somebody heal for maybe a hundred or so of gold is love but it's not as bad as the Top Lane gig finally think the first time all series gives Cloud9 the first dragon and it's all in credits as Benadryl can they have played that bottom side without pressure so freaking well there's another look at the the top dive the mechanics are very easy to pull off so we don't have to restate those just route right there for Devante it to 100% certainty on your death for fudge he knows he's like a brother flash he's completely dead there that is truck cards that you have you know three people of Rel Rel warming up to the top side and what it means though he's going to be more important. Side Invasion 400 these clothes are get to take some camps back from bladder who had controlled full in come here for the jungle match up because of the top side Focus that closer it's been so much time there in efficiently you're trying to deny five nights bottomland they did get the flash out of vent and and Vulcan how to use his way earlier in the pressure but I still think big props to Cloud Nine's bottom line for avoiding disaster down there for absorbing so much pressure now it has started to surface in the nacs difference but Vulcan had been staying quite competitive in the first couple of drinks and it's only after that last big double wave was was denied to them that they really started to fall behind they're still getting a lot of value out of increase Soul generation down here sure they're getting overtime live with the jungle being a lead for bladder is a 1000 goalie 400 above what you normally get from the first blood in the assist so it is none of these winning in the farm game it showing even despite support Goulding come everything else going across money is a none of these pockets that's being answered by a dragon but probably still hunted these favorite hidden playing every mid-game better for the garden of the early game has been going so closer now getting the herald as well as box cutter was already on their side it's going to feel pretty comfortable you've got no one coming out of stopping just yet come out here and help make sure it's going to be safe you got something coming down to do the same and just her for good measure FBI we're on the way up to see that no one is answering and I got to go back to bottom line to grab their own wave they'll lose may be a minute or two unless you how much of a problem was going to pop that I
ability to actually perform with multiple different styles of compositions i e g on the other end as you say another were pretty high expectations for them coming in here too and I do think that those got even higher at the beginning of the split when they were looking so dominant look like they were really know picking up right where they had left off if they were continuing that upward trajectory that we had seen throughout spring as they started off kind of slow and got better and better and better, but they have hit some some stumbles now you know they haven't had a lot of of Queen games lately you know all three of their losses I think we're pretty one-sided you do for it for the opponent so we'll see how he does look here today. Just something that I've kind of had my eye on a lot lately it is really gaining in popularity quite a bit of this is a pic that is both strong and Lane it helps out your jugular a lot that is something they think people are really kind of underwriting about it in this counter jungling meta Hotshot is so valuable you know giving you the information of which side of the map the opposing Gungor it's on do you know if you can actually invade and seal to a cancer or not you know thatsuch a core part of League of Legends in this meta and Ash bring that very very well yes it is also a suitcase most played mid laner but this felt so cord the golden Guardians winds that I'm just surprised it be exempt to bite the bullet and say no no no we were so worried about you for speaking your kind of picking us that that's what I mean not on the table at all chords still plenty of 80 carries and still up Calista and Ezreal decently strong in this patch at 10:30 Nazgul the hover Ezra and lock in there for bank so, has gotten your really really popular because it's becoming a flex has been a lot of marks and John was getting Ryan and did these kind of double Mercantile, there are very popular around the world or mid and you can also do have a secondary interest I'll support volveras Affleck tr22 this could be gone. This could become a maid or support and so far he's been staying with with quite a bit of flexibilityI wouldn't I wouldn't mind the Kindred at all Kindred is actually quite a decent match up into the volibear and if you do go that route you're also denying perhaps one of the competition that you could be looking for a with this, which is that double Marksman style since Grace has already bent and Kendra would be the only one available but trundle pretty safe pretty standard Suzuki was the champion that he kind of really made his name for himself in the spring split that the chance that I think most teams did not want to do they play ever again at the same as brake fluid games that he gets to make his debut on this camping this is a a thing I had wanted to see from him for a while I'm glad he's back here on adding to be very very exciting going to get you out of this one and forth on the other side game for FBI only a second of the split but he played a lot of it back in Spring as well in FBI sent to be very good lately maybe carry such a nerd like a Valiumsomeone who is willing to play it even with you be banned out you know you can husband been going down in priority since the nurse on 1013 but as real as getting pair with a lot of enchanters a lot of these solid support and I've been getting seated this even compared with caramel with Bard's even with with Lulu and some of the style of Champions that gives you very, these days to pair vs girl with a rain support and look for in a little more of a postal Lane where you can play the Ezra out more aggressively instead of just kind of sitting back in an AMF gang at the Torah twitch a lot of those mail a flood Azrael Lanes do tend to be a lot of fun. They can get something else to poke out for the back lot of course we do gold got his dick in the car by themselves but as you mentioned chance like Lulu's still available on Parkland Ami will see what I can come through here I'll keep my Degan the volibear is flexible we don't know if it's jungle in the front door now or Top Lane blind you know if we're going to get rid of the dateyeah they both are honestly at this point and I wouldn't be surprised to see him bring out something like the Nautilus that if that is still available in HD is fairly low and engage in Outlook has been a favorite of diesel over the years, pelios very strong competition there and if you do go with the brown that would mean it is karma mid that's kind of how this is super-powered of Elio's but you have the defense when Brom you have the speed up in the shielding from that, you really are looking kind of just protect this one hyper carry style Nautilus also you know what works well but it's okay so it's going to be, support this should be lissandra mid I really can't get going top and lysandra is kind of one of those classic answers to La Flaca point-and-click CC the ultimate in particular really is powerful is LeBlanc have to dive in there it is very fragile if you can do a lot of birth in his reliant on the mobility on in restoring for distorting backwards and plus I'm talking into that pretty easily so this will be a tricky game for did you get wellflowers favorite as big as a locksmith top ten salon and I will say this is not for the landmass of it to bowl someone out there will be a little bit awkward but you can take the car and fix Goodreads in through it it's not the worst thing in the world we look at the match of overall but it does mean that engage options are available for EG to Wukong come through at the top when it's pretty easy with a clone for organized into and eat your flash can even be in there as well but you can close the gap barely effectively to start off team fights python catch as you said answer is built on to Ultimate quite well also does help to go out to the side Lanes to try to reinforce it will block want to play split for style it will be Volver David Lee sin gets locked in so not wanting to play Volver in thejungle I do think that this is a good early matchup for the fall of air into the Wukong you really do want to just kind of take a shorter trays at the volibear know so that will calm can't get as much out of that passive with really knew the extended trading patterns restart to regen a lot research get those cool down as backup but this is a pretty interesting game I do tend to favor golden Guardians like straight-up v e v I think it's a lot easier to come you don't but I do have the ability to get fixed if you have the ability to be out probably more effectively to the sidelines of the block as well and I will stay Golden Gardens Portland is somewhat limited it's it's at least, Shields that helps leasing can you live at that house full of where the topping should have plenty of stats but other than most other kind of turning on target once in a while you're almost on single front line with a trundle on in the side at a time catch there is well to make a lot of it look pretty easy on the EEG side so we both can be quite good LeBlanc I'm just not quite the same team fight Champion but just in caseblock is so good he finds the openings you find the burst and a squishy, support is going to get one shot at least once in this game I'm pretty sure if you can tell me he's a game at all intrigued to see how these cops actually do play out as far as starting out to fight through, the one side was Sandra I think the primary tool on the other closer of course can find those cool Ward Hopsin the kicks in and all that kind of fun stuff can happen but overall can be very exciting game I think these things are fairly close in in skill right now at Golden Gardens got robbed of a couple of their of their wins and if their record should look like closer. To eegee's and it does today and it's going to be fun game that should be really interesting is it was a very interesting compositions I think you know as you say clear go buttons I think I always always makes it kind of fun to watch it will seem to know exactly what they're looking for know what they have to prevent what they have to be able to ask you. And you know it it's kind of just who's gonna be able to handle that better but I do expect easy to look more for skirmishes more for controlling vision and finding people out of brushes with things like they'll Blancthey do think if you'd have like a full Envision straight-up v e v their front-line killing in the best yes or not look incredible tanks on the other side but it's going to be tricky for LeBlanc anytime you go in if you do get it up by Lisandro in a team fight you can't expect to just get hundreds of zero than that so probably going to be a bit of the evasive playing to go out to the side lane try to get some of the rotate try to catch them in rotation try to have multiple people go to one side of the map and it looked at a key at the okay to walk for as we get ourselves on the summoner's rift vs golden garden spider versus three and five of these teams will finish up their first round robin which is play each of the other nine teams once and I'm going to sit around 50/50 I'm going to spend a little time talking to Golden Gardens they have yet in their history of a League of Legends spinach a split above 500 they have never gone 10 and 8 or better coming to the split I thought this was the rust that would do it this the team that can find 10 or more I thought they couldplay Big Boss 2 games with dragon soul like if you just finished out those games that is 5 and 3 going into maybe 6 or 3 if you can close one out that is the kind of start that Golden Gardens have loved to have seen again very very close lost have kept them sub 50% but I think the back half the split this game included can definitely go well as closer does a leash looks red is going to be threw up there be able to help me poop form of what they had in the spring split where they were the second or third best team is the composition that they drafted in those clothes washers right in and the advantages that they threw away sometimes to actually not be able to close out those games because oftentimes you know in those early stages they were drafting things like Natalie like Jason do all early game you know high-tempo high pressure and they're crazy normous leaves because failing to close it out so it is obviously difficult if you draft in a more for the late game then put yourself in that advantageous position and we'll see you know what tourist style they want to kind of go back to his that's a cute little mini game there you could see as his UK distorted forward Demonte is expecting just okay to destroy backwards when he cast a spell so he actually threw his cue towards where the Distortion would go back to and just took actually just held on Interstate in for an additional Auto so dodging it out and there's lots of little mini games in this matchup with one of the reasons I kind of like it you know as lesandro you're trying to actually landed W immediately as LeBlanc distort in to Route LeBlanc and Proctor Aftershock so you can have a chance of winning no Trace it's already a play as they still wants to walk up can't quite find the slope as Fiskar knows he was not spotted on the way in the early enough clothes there a Boston butt look how long did Montag has already under 200 hp distorts away Stay The Life of Frederick Summers as he is up one Camp the trundle if both gates going about too much is generally not going to look this one-sided he hasn't getting the better of so many of these trades and then what is actually going to have to keep it back already which is pretty rough because you know if we could actually see to do K be able to just get this way push and you may not be able to do it but since Karen is here so I'm going to try shows up and they just asked for the wave in you can actually hold your TV and it just be able to walk straight back to Lane you'll get a much better by and still have that teleport available for a later on I'm Soo the case of the Shelf comes on the bottom side of the Guardians limit early teleport he got post down quite a bit FBI last in the same pole it's not the worst recall ever but it means his tears talking to be a lot later than I wanted to normally would love to have you do a 1200 gold or so first Recon Ezreal by to your TV back and then play the farm-out game FBI you do not have to be in that situation to what difficulty to Tunnel about little bit longer though it is that a gold Garden Portland is on low Mana which couldn't hurt your bill to trade back but they want to wait another minute into the recall so they can get the f word on a Philly ocean with low manifold and with the cold lead for Bank sometimes that means EG gets to have Wave Control and head to make you recall awkward for FBI movie what kind of locked in a position where you're pushing and you have low Mana it's obviously very dangerous potential ganks can come in there okay you can see it that much better by was talking about an additional doran's ring on top of the dark still at they all have both actually based on to buy there so I will see you tomorrow to take and get this pushed out and read that as he's looking to not sure if she's doing it did actually get a freeze out there or not but you know that's a little bit. You know you talked about in traffic and reason that they're dropping His companion was actually often to deal with lysandra and also the ability to play in the side lane but this is what your kind of giving up right you're picking at the Port that almost worthless in this to be too you're not really going to be able to engage 4 it into the karma and you fellows did he try to run at this karma karma just Heather's you and walks away like you have Israel in the situation where it's almost 1:00 be to ask and you are going to be expecting this led to be to to be losing Flash Tickets to roots on both sides and Monta he's got to be careful he cannot fly traps first what not a bad trait on a 340 G to Zucca able to get them something something back there has been scaring went to the steel in a clever little usage of the Tom Kenshin of our over the walls we didn't have the flashback out he could have if he needed to but didn't actually have to pull that song or so golden Guardians do end up grabbing the dragon but they lose First Blood and they are going to lose at least a couple minions here for Demonte the fact that this is real that is supposed to be in the bruising to be to actually got that first what is a pretty big deal as well because that's going to set him up with very effectively since Darren did hop in but I tried it feel that it was way too healthy this might did come down early but no one for me he was in position that night to store forward from zukie allow that changed the land that's it for the easy skill shot their front Bang honestly Demonte should have just accepted his death at that point but wanted to try to flash those last go and see if you get out and pick up by Golden Guardians wave manicured well enough that FBI knew he can grab this way without too much difficulty even after taking the recall after going to the Drake from the lights a little bit and efficient to walk back to the future as well after shoving his own way and it blew his hand it off to Jesu queso both Portland to feel really comfortable IBC Bank love and having a little bit faster is well it is a CTA Mount Rushmore on clothes
when when you hear that Mooney get signed to a team people start to think old man is I are they going to stop them out now then they're going to have to move a lot of stuff around but, I really stepped up that far in the ALCS to the draft Point EG and Azucar specifically all their losses they've been the clangour games that have been the kassadin vs. Cloud9 be of the karma that's not going to work out most recently the kog'maw game which cannot go split push very little Mobility champion and people are starting to really constrict their view on Suzuki and what he can do as a player and what the overall team should then do as far as their game plan coming into camp in selecting haven't yet. I think deeply the second or third best team of the spring split and know that was off the back of them being a very explosive very aggressive and then when it came inexceptionally well but it was a bunch of stuff you have pressure out of the midline now either for the first 12 minutes the game and stick Lasik Arma game we're okay yes he has to put pressure but he can't be explosive very much in the early game and you're waiting to scale for rent to Ultimate and and so they're trying those Styles and I think early in summer is the time to try those files I will always accept it to trying to Branch out because the topic do Lake playoffs that's going to be really comfortable for a team as good as eg3 lost because of those profile so when is it go back to Old standards Old Faithful maybe it's all right what they lock in a little piece of old baseball with is very good scaling Frontline very good scaling and back Ryan a classical belly first round on a red tideare we see so many teams do it over summer split what are Mortals going to look at a little bit more playmaking I like always trying to go this route into NFL Leo stronda opening when you get here at least in Naples Lee sin or a Naples Xfinity to go try and create a lot of those pics earlier in the game and basically our goal is what you're saying I'm going to try and create a play get a kill then I take the objective trying to lose the one who grind-it-out place off of you know a winning lane or something and focuses on Hilti TE a little bit more but listen and rakan double walk-in is so much more we need to find our pick we need to find our kills first then we'll go pick up the objective afterwards and look it up Priority on getting it to Moana Boulevard as soon as possible and all we got. Side we are ready to go for going to like his back if you're against the lure of whoMatt is going to be on tanked that's okay to play the game out but also means all right could you do focus on support bands work on always worried about tankier engage support breast also to me is one of the really good ones I always talk about it but seems like people Bentley on a nautilus more often but I'm always happy to play thrash into it take the school matchup I love when you see a good threats player interrupt work on with the plays and then hit you hit him with a sentence while they're trying to jump back to their carries in a straight line so I would vote for that little bit more skill intensive but I know so many people just love going with the not cuz it's that either point-and-click and obviously you just have the auto spell to be strong and they're so V tried-and-true Allura malphite is available it will not be able to come around convair did Mortals very easily could have went to play another organic opposition so it will push Infinity down his Zoe is still up with a new pic for him a Laura the weather Champions that he's super well-known rappers time in academy I do like it through the top sides and more Tanki auctions kind of grinding you down or got got to bust a couple of batches ago pretty far in the past but nobody else really picked it up you see sometimes like some spot games from with or something in the NL East the other other players that really like the champion in and enjoy the notes in my thinking is of it but like you said I have really liked his orianna play this far turn up Sports super well on State and now he's got a chance on. You know one of the most iconic carry Champs in League of Legends I like to come to the boat slice your Evil Geniuses are going again for a fairly standard teamfight base composition now I will say to do K is good on damaged Focus team Fighters his Corky game right that was the very first for the game of the slip for them right when they dismantled CLG very very hard on their first games we can play the backbone is really well I'd like to become a champion with some agency in the Oriana can be the big playmaker can go for Flash shock waves and what not as needed so I think this fits him very very well I still think neeg comp that backed up with solid team fighting bangers on a filios they've obviously got a solid front line here with it was a trundle with the vole a bear with a nautilus in the Corky start the workout help it out. Phil's well-rounded it feels good for what I got to go to do the Block band away means you got to play something more standard and it's going to look for the solid have looked pretty good on his light up they played some top teams very very close and I'm excited. Come out I mean they've they've put the 50 roster back in Apollo with hockey well and then the the rookie solo Lane kind of flavor it's it's been a bit of a Revival for for the team and end for the Brandon and people cheering for them again as underdogs the definitely still under dog's going to get CG here as this EG draft we've talked about having kind of a check list of approved azuki Champions and it definitely does does check that box so they are aware they are within the bounds and setting themselves up for success of course we know now that second place we got two squads up there tide at 6 into EG cannot reach that Mark at the end of the first round Roberts they will have to sit around for Thor so even if they went out until they get three matches I could pull those things down with them and it got a lot of that is been experimenting it feels like a certain degree and an easier still exceptionally strong team that I think they're still why the favorites to go to do very well maybe go to Worlds things like that we get the cops to the bottom of screen here as well and I do hold out hope for a more get the interview before you know where he's talking about well we can probably make playoffs do it but I think Mortals are our maybe the fifth or sixth place team I think this is about where I would pick this team so far you kind of threw out the first four games look at the ones they played so far and Andy's Games book 1 of all this team looks looks pretty solid and we'll see what they can get here we are still in some competitive Integrity right now so we can further dive into the Champion Select while we have some time again I talked about as soon as they were pics but I love this this type of jungle match up where you're staying right here is the initiative. Here's the ball take this ball in the early game let's see what kind of plays you can create and him and hakuho do have one of the above average support in Jungle a time spent together I would choose jungle support proximity stats this is this a match made in heaven with the most mobile Champs in the game I always love to see when they can make those jumps and play off of each other to catch someone out of position and so you look for these important timing Windows when bottom gets there first week off or they support almost all the time to head straight up Midland so they have options of going to either side of the map before we're looking to to place their Wards with their jungler sometimes they can you know go offensively try and get gullane and you and her got Lane is one of those so those types of time and where you're looking at a couple of these backs are or what we're going to keep our eyes on realistic leave you was well aside from posting Volver who can Ulta wait a little bit The Immortals jungle support power Duo I think have a lot of very good targets and these kids can absolutely come through so I am very curious to see how that we can play on coming into the week Jaco and expect the lead the entire league in Kill precipitation over all that they were they were best of the entire league those two had done so much. lifting gear for more than a year to other very very best players in and I think they're going to look really solid now we did have to remake the game at Smithy I believe he love the game which means we have to rebuild the delay so for all that stuff we are going to go to a store commercial break when we come back though meet us here for a little bit hello and welcome back to the show we are getting into the game before too terribly long you got our faces for about 2 minutes and then some of those ripped floor plates Champions and Summoner icons in the whole the whole kit and caboodle
it has just been TSM looking down and being like they are not that far apart in the standings right now so if CLG get this Victory Tye TSM in the standings to his point I think that's one of the things that reignites the Rivalry in the players in the team's themselves if you can make it happen on stage gear that's what has to happen honest I think it's much more on stereo. Back up what they've been saying and it's so true it is talking about how much he has sent was heads and shoulders above CLD it was over a thousand days since I don't get me a glass of eating Chia 72 Matt Street was finally broken a few blocks ago that you can yes right field is a winning record they were 10th Place flat split they've got the pants that tie for third place they wouldn't hear TSM tintypesecond With the Wind near these are top of the table teams that can beat a top-end morality at them against them fix a replace double if it won a championship with seals eat at the table to the same and its Affiliates blocked in double can easily be that botlink Focus carry that through fairly of everybody loves one of the best tailors in the game ruin probably going to be the one on Bolivar it's still going to be a flex pic but he was one of the first one to fully embrace the rework koala bear and try and use it in Lane super aggressively actually really like some of the early looks at they got with that champion some of the early wind I feel like that started some of the momentum for the comeback for the squad early on in the line of a champion play before in this split but not a highly prized looking atif you can push me into him he don't have a lot of defensive tool to withstand that there's life skills sometimes but not great and so I want to see if they could really take that with the biofrost and set up some more components to make this early Misfortune pickworth it is very good especially against Ofelia so I do like the mule Misfortune Pacific matchup but also I want to see the whole team comp with cc to set up those ultimate for stick say he has played it earlier there were some unlucky plays some Mitch plays where you know he would get quickly interrupted I remember one from a a prom ultimate but looks like he's going to have to avoid a couple things here Leeson and orange both walked in on very good hitting ultimate obviously on stationary targets and wanted to run in this game you talking about a we set up the fact that full of air is whatgoing to go either way they got really could have come through instead we're going to see how to get to cut a support role as kind of gave you a lock-in Nautilus here for Smoothie leaving Midland and a Top Gun go up in the air in a bit was going to be kind of guarantee that we'll be at the band start going through options to Keep Us Alive I do think that smoothie definitely deserves some credit for his Nautilus play it that's farthest but it's it's been a big part of their engages Nautilus as well as they work on the thesis more bottomland Focus the fancier should just continue playing at the ports get them taking away some of the Blind Pig Ogdensburg pobelter TF in Oreana both off the table or two of his vet Champions and obviously two of the most prevalent in The Metayeah of course we are going to eventually get a lot more roaming by the way as well I think she's been criminally underrated as a mid laner for very good at supporting by the way Morgana mid in the shield comp by tovi and In dr.axe odesza Bloom here in North America or it's like that one dragon eggs game just got it leads to a lot of these multishield Morgana plus a Karma cops but I like that you open the door for possible Purex and pick because I also know that he has been playing the AP mid Nunu andis is viable in this composition as well you want your other phone to set up the Orange is there that's great you have a really good afelio scaling a deep threat so they're the pieces are here to set up for a possible AP Nunu as a cop but 1013 playing Dark Harvest I track two of the top Callender's in Korean solo spamming it and I'm just fingers crossed for it but it just opening the door on it at least for a minute and just see if it comes through DSM going to Buck the trend of defensive options are not going to feel for double if they're going to go into seal GH Wright Havoc is Leona is locked into have a ton of really good and gate construction cuz obviously lead for double Queen up no problem too full of air is Blackfin jungleand more damn it comes through for TFM great champ overall office you can go I mean anytime we always see a zero and a failure to pick together skills like a broken record azir brings self dealing with also benefit the Affiliates player and sets of a crazy good late-game 5e 540 attempt to look at the sealed you died I want a little bit more investment in some early game here with most Corgi pics now because they bumped it over a couple patches no longer burn staying on you being able to even land the slow on people by dispatching them with the package is opened up some really cool offensive plays for the mid laners a note which that loves to me I'm sure most missed field somewhat on the field besides that we looked at we saw that really am okay here we go get Point Camp Island the top Corky can pile over the top but the come kind of got rounded out pretty quickly and I honestly I'm looking at the engage on the side from TSM trying to evade Leona + or in combination is really difficult especially with how good speaker has been on lease in so I'm at my eyeballs on the CLG carries for sure to to check their positioning cuz it's definitely going to require some good Play It Again the battle for second and third the Rivalry hopefully reignited being top-tier both together for the first time in a while after they met in final so many years ago. Bonsu and shake out and get the better of their opponents in this game through in a broken play will do battle topside I really want to see it you know I have to double with was talking about if this game is a banger I really do want to see The Return to the top for these two teams see if they can push each other to the limits ventev openings and you get your recall on Wiggly as you can see on the map there the topside he dropped his defensive trinket War then you switch over by recalling and buying your sweeper early for volibear because Volver is very good early ganks it just ensures that you are not being seen as you go for the first one and give you a lot more options for clearing out enemy Vision some quick checks around the map is going to be a bot line so I bought side jungle start for speaker ruin walks up and puts a wart to COK indeed BK is running at rest off no surprise there least list for Wiggly going to let 6 days a week to get a bit of Bruce Lee Lane controlled look like it felt that it was free to focus fire the early minion but it shouldn't really Diamond sing guardless Christian spell the first cancelled your second model of time comes between the two please go down and one of the big differences in the comps is is a force the top side of the Gangplank fair for ruin with the grass now that stuff does not in the game anymore trying to farm up and continue latest activehealth versus the orne your focus is on gold generation getting the most out of your passive out of those extra shots you want to try and get multi explosions with the barrels so you can cash in on multiple minions with a single cast but also keeping your eyes and balancing your Mana for those grass products would be there is queue Camp Rock the grass so it's very easy you charge it up in time it on the minions and then fire off your cue for your extra help stacking and that's the main point of the Gangplank pick into the horn in a late-game scaling for a for damaged where is Orange trying to hand out all the ornament yeah and I got to like you going to find a crumb of it in that match for second whatever ruin a keto stop for the Q broken played trade back in his own and it with the flow Lane to get the guarantees knock up that support vets for Broken Blade push it some damage back ruined with the early push only his loss to CVS on this truck so far but again every time it gets grass with the Q broken leg straight back get some damage to players is of all top leaders who played every game for their team if you have the highest and lowest goal difference of ten or top laners in this game broken plate is number one in his number I Building 7 of players that have played so far this school generation built into the champion so this should help out and try to balance that that climbing up the rankings a little bit early recall actually after this go to Crabby see weekly ended on the the top side their ass hobo jungle is going back to get their Smyth's and I want to see if he actually makes a pass at bottom side there is the the Scuttle there for them which you can be pleased to buy as a polar bear and double if brown frogs are both pushed up so that would be an area with some CC set up that they could try and attack Bentley wants to attack these Wards as he's looking at his own jungle song okay we saw us coming we knock you down as the first three calls come through jungle in Jungle items on both sides with Lee and now not going to be in the river brush. 55th and play Ratatouille still wants he's going to land the anchor big damage on to Leona all the trouble with before they saw toward you waiting Wiggly is claiming that work you see him clearing that Ward so doublelift about prostitutes her some criticism beer set up smoothie deserves the credit on the Nautilus he lands the hook he gets there and stick say he gets all his Autos in and weight saving his double up to then you double live as the carrier for the job on his double up to get the kill really well play there by cogn Sticks a butt the same thing you got to you got to say no respect given topside as well we get a look at Rouen invading taking sociology opening up extremely good in the first stages up his game now if you'll be kind of nice and kind of cold lead what you expect for the Sisters first blood as they now in a play run the drinks give you quite far from watts and walked up and goes back to Netflix on top keep a fire in a way it's another match double Rome jungler and support over here but pobelter has the inside track and with Corky getting there I like it really who has been on both teams of its arrival reflected in the DSM just last year they traded 80 carries in her so I could it supports I should say and hold up what's an early break at 6 minutes to alter a lot of the interview time spent on doublelift in double of saying all right yeah if you can be a rivalry again if c o g step up and yet double of thin Val Frost other ones that give up the first kill on the roam where Wiggly clears a ward beforehand and CLG make back-to-back Place take the dragon it looks like they are holding up their end of the bargain free Juilliard exciting to see it come through is Voltaren viersen fight a little bit longer than midlane but it's mostly wave clear for now are far for one himself might put that bites going to take for Wiggly is at least equal and can't count will do with the next aggressive play it's going to be into this game is there something to take for quite a while to Drake's already gone and Harold doesn't spawn just yet Corky starting tear as well filter super confident here backing up it is going to give him a lot of time or later anyway
rise for them about 9 though like you're saying Top Dog in the LCS for of spring as well as summer the art of the way with five bands done already more Twisted fake and get dropped off the table at the lab are going to start riding the bench a whole a lot more here in the LCS ship a really do not think is that Bible in the morning there's a big enough to not make her that because of thirst I would say let your bonus play if you want to or if they want to and just going to take for the late but not that right now I want to Respec skills leave Eros and Calista he will of marching band. As well see if they continue on with them early tick along that line Israel and Astros available pill and I getting a lot of people have started to walk away from the champion Riley's put a little bit of distance so I like 590 going to be as usual route here specially for it's been has been yeah I do want to support was nerfed in 10.13 looking at all these Global including Regional League like EU Masters I feel it still the second or third most picks in Van Geffen improv play still above 80% residents will follow me over time it seems to like yeah there are better but even in the early days the past people still d r e ginna play with one at least it again here by Olaf is most games played the split that's not always a hard, but it is very rapid we got very very standard 80 carries and jugglers Wildenstein honestly for the lane the extra range obviously with asriel and that's one of the victims to use against the fellas but I just like I know there's a lot of people pretty king of the jungle scale as well but least in especially for cloud nine to action for them and we've seen blabber in the last game in a row because diving tours super early on Friday to force the lot of plays for the team and if they lochinver caught on top of it that's okay play making once again at 49 Gaston 10.13 it does not always fixing to Kill Order sometimes act wburg sometimes a Max of laughs goes until like you and broke like it's kind of stimuli based on players 31st is going to require more damage of macbreak and if both wants to go super hard and do in Akron people have been more damage on the gauges not working so far but the more likely set up here the back line actually, walk in deities cuz the oldie can always reach to self feel when your left alone so I think it would be well and if I even though Ezreal is not usually considered such an aggressive is Bill benefits off of us pretty well yeah I definitely agree the ability to look up very long way especially because call Cloud Nine cops are some form of God, that's the way of being a roofer good delivery for that and getting off the layer that's cute. I like that dance from gotv gotv blinding I'd love to take a 6 down to build you been in the bed liner away from this key here to house been to Cali out there since Jason gone there as well to the most pick champions for both of us have been banned out there with their gone this time and now C9 blind pick one of their pillows they could go for a top laner realistic lien in cash by 9 This Way with lyrics before that with Twisted Vape Plus a lot of jungle attention all Stampy for licorice and Blasting the top size it looks like it's going to get locked in again here so let's see there's no specific date this time around maybe still blabber jugs can throw some attention up there but blinding Liu Kang is is definitely punishable you can you have some strong melee matchups into its I know a lot of people that like Jacob that's as far as melee want you can also do the AP route if you want them. This stuff is active but I like a lot of the Bruiser options yeah I might be there for us we have physical damage to the Jungle physical damage in the bottling there as well as if there is a splinter come through and malphite is Magic damage light armor types pretty well the problem is there aren't a lot of V park that's real on land or they've been very very low ping which is the case here since the LPS is online after off the service in LA and so you got like six Bing on the servers and Sven should have no problem in a way but has good for the pirate solution in your eye can withstand a lot of the pressure as well then the flying the Phoenix 1 flags are throwing up that emote over and over every chance he gets in the game so it makes sense that he's going to use one of doing be the best Champions that he has been using very frequently in the LCL in the rumble and he plays that style as well we talked about so much with the Romans support than a few lines to both of the sidelines for me with bladder trying to feel all those pills and really push the lead in aggression up to another level biggest thing about Rumble is it of course on your level at 6 you had so much more team fighting power but also be able to chase people down with those Lowe's and the long range cast of equalizer you can you can join from the much further distance than most of the other mid laners even if he's not the fate and you can get away with a gold card it's still a lot of damage yeah I'm actually glad you mentioned early-game pressure here as well and mentioned the gun was because 10.30 North Sandra is well the first eight levels of the gamer Q cost more Mana so her waveclear Hurley Layman's but is not quite as good either so in the first unit 9 Minutes the game we may see this key get the jump a little bit more often and I put out there can get let me know the first blue hen it off at 7:30 or so and then kind of weather that storm it is still will mean less pressure in the early game at 7 to watch out for you know how much can the latest move around because you have to miss key is all about going to the sideline about selling his teammates up I'm not sure how much are we talking mouth like I'm not sure about you can dive for a nose real but we still expect there to be pressure on those sites I definitely expected to be pressure in a cloud 9 game let's see if the LG have what it takes to be the first to take them down in summer everybody's trying to be the first see if they can get that one game off of Cloud 9 but Cloud Nine look like they've got that 18 do in their sights and have been sticking to it already Super Galaxy come back breaker disc he's going to hope that he can make sure seal G don't get to come back into this game I want to hang out that's kind of interesting because cloud nine people say they have a very good early game overall but it really depends on what you measure the stat if you're measured it 15 yeah they are clapping everyone there up two-and-a-half Drake's every single time they're they're up a bunch of gold if you measure it at 10 only two of their players have a gold lead at 10 minutes jungle admit everyone else tends to be a little bit behind the other teams are good at leaning against them it's when you get into any mid-game Skirmish at all that's when Cloud 9 turns it on and sew the first 10 I think I'll wear CLG can strike their early game not pictures too good either none of their players have gold leave the 10 minutes to spite their foreign to record they win the games there's not a header Leon. I'm like a little bit earlier and are no Frost Marty and I'm just kind of curious what kind of looking like as a result here for you as well but really defined the new 590d kissing their butt Dial soap opera has the most kills in the jungler in the top twelve of children the LCS is this platter at the top Now 50 is number 4 in assist for all LCS players and it's not another mid laner in the top 12 for assist put that on hold as we have bladder going for a Redbox level Tuesday night with him just blast behind but look at that Summer is gone off the very first bank of the game right from Red Bluff all the way down to the bottom side combining it with walk-in with the ignite to get double Summoners off at 6 a force the bad back for him as well as quick as much there as Larry goes right back into blue side clear sentence waste any time at it he's going to go to ruin do evil and quite a few smells down there is going for the standards of Mana sustained right he's got scorched she's got the look Apollo has accused soon he might know he walked in the Clippers playing basketball right they're ruined bottom with the minions and the Clone right next to him as well both of them with channeling their potions and then she's going to be able to be here exactly how many minions are helping out with the fight has welcomed into the trouble range plus the Canon A-1 Auto off and then with the extra out of there yet do I head on this trade and I think I think you know that you're busy her so she can take you out of the brush she's going to land by the steam at the time but that is Flash down on for members within four minutes on the sealed Eastside very fun to watch you work here top laner the zip lash was licorice there but whatever make you some quick work of both of the other lanes in that scenario when they're all down like this all of the lane for CO2 now have to be second-guessing themselves you can see they're all at their turrets every member of Zod very Weary at the moment and that's when whoever can return to farm the camps after me ozee aggressive work has been shot in the line the length that is just a shock to me that somehow he's farmed despite the fact that he had to run by the bank and now you get away from the counter take belt and a level lead for ruin this fight could go very very well he's going to get hit there and Labyrinth killer was sick by Wiggly Safeguard about how to lame was that mid-length play that they tried to pull off so get the really well time you from Wrigley Field to push them off and create some pressure there too because of it Liquors is not backing them and they don't have to pressure to deny the minion wave but ends up turning into still to be able to get the menu for baby shower but you're not going to be a pretty well. Expertly done here on Wukong knows the damage output knows he could it would want her to go out of the devil long so it obviously really helpful in that once he's knocked out the way it's going to be the capital D m at Dunn that's a lot of wave control that's going to feel really comfortable as venti he's down to the bottom line here is stacking up now get the colon that one as well as there wasn't much help to buy accept a longsword if he was going for 34 so yeah I don't like that fire Crystal was with the 80 instead of his hours so you want to deny as many of these means that you can there's no fella 4468 thinking when she gets plastic surgeon so you deny that you can a mouse of that way and increase the sleep or I would have woken spent plus allow in both rooms to go roam around with Viber free big Power opening airport by 9 that is under 6 minutes during the game and Drake I seen this before and it's called every cloud 9 give me the entire split-toe turn down the tops for Big Timber II comes in and that is our difference. Of time to of the toppling double ultimate activation there for electrician stacked up their conquerors so he's really he's got his early TM at 2 so it's 9 Elites the wave licorice with the Wukong once again showing the rest of the North American Top laners what they are missing out on yeah this is this is what top it looks like when you go for the solo kill and it backfires on you back at level 3 this one looks different without that gold injection but obviously now is going to be a real tough one for ruin and the rest of seals you to navigate this really game is going to look great visually which is vast majority in this game all right foot to head off to post office you can get back out on any of the minions we haven't even really seen a big influence of the oven did Lane I don't know where can I hike it up for misky there's been a lot of jets blabber lease in I am crazy loonies and then liquid V self doing work on the Roof dog experience Advantage with the old killed by the way well yeah and it was to be fair One auto differences far as I know how close that was in the miscalculation but that means a whole lot I thought I can use that goes off
we get to see this build up here yeah we're going to see it happened it happened right now for Golden Gardens topic pretty solid Wyndham sells takedown flyquest last week though we'll see just how strong these do you need to get ourselves into Champion Select every single game at Academy so far I will see if it's up here for contracts like that one two times as well as we are on Pat 10.13 that means we had some Calista nurse in the belly Ochsner has come off the table a little bit more often talk my bucks I think more likely have an AP bit later than is a pot liner contracts not going to get that looks like they're going to respect a little bit there with the diddly band pretty hot the ash let's talk about this for a second because this is been a worldwide friend had a really strong Resurgence especially an LPLlck because she is but the crowd control arrows it's best if you get out of fog of War do I really have enjoyed the sequencing an lpo and lck as as one of the main counters to move faster tire kit he has a very slow-moving attack platform heels by the outhere you can during Hurricane you can do more cryptoverse to see which way she ends up going to go ahead and grab a beer as well as raise gets locked in there were some very small a little while receiving more more folder jungle definitely still The Eclectic either Sunday or contract I have talked to contract I know itlikes playing polar bear a lot in the jungle so we'll see if that is the actual match up in one of the Champions that has a decent amount of answers you can smoke bomb what is charging and if you save your e - 4 for the volume that you don't get it by the slow mix a lot easier to kite him and you can prop your face so I think it is a good early pick up a ton of gold and Gardens there and then they pick up the time change what does it did Niall whenever you have asked it really helps to take away Tom kench to save people that get hit with the arrows but also you know if it's a batch for your team as well yeah of course with Rush locked and it's not it's only denial but it does make a lot of sense of Ash what's going to go on for that one that makes a lot of senseby fear and yes but I'm not the best at getting away from find as the band thing coming through trouble going to be a another Jungle Band in the way a contract that means the tops of your Wild on the graves trundle in Italy for the Aldi's today yes definitely excited to hear very well could again still be the volibear and they're going to have to reveal if it is Top Line or bottom land first so I expect golden Guardian first pick on the second round of pic do you want to be one of their other solo laners I would expect midlane actually because it's easier if you can pick like this do it right now cuz I put a lot of these Global Champions that one there would be with the ultimate for 12 old yeah and this is going to be because I do want to see who's going in the Champions want to be the first end of the fight and that means there's not a good and Galileo die Target in letter grades go in toppling we're not going to see Nocturne for closer cast EP is going to be the Midland answer to Caleo he's going to attack Mr but probably still going to be for Laine pressure out of Randall overall what kind of a gauge reads be out of authors are the top side we need his fixed he's going to have counterfeit to your nephew's get to the side where the bullets are goes which match if you want to go for their 80 Focus actually though so we started seeing a yellow Korean Toe with you there's a couple of dark harvest the blame for the jungle if we made it pretty much the same Renekton is locked in there you go we get the contract volibear all right have a good one free one from this list which comprises is not a Jace tfcon dalio yes you can Global end of the team but he's not the one to interrupt practice I think they need a team fighter gear for Hunter the top by tenant that combo going to line up the back line in the Galleria can dive right over the top just a lot of gate very strong team flooding the issue I like this look the following composite yeah I mean people can still remember Hunters Canyon at Worlds with DSM he's going to have to get in there with the flash a lot of time as well to either mentioning his appointment for engaging for Golden Guardians in making this whole team cops come together in the last pics to put a lot of pressure on him on his flask World on single most important spell cool down in this entire game moving forward for both teams to keep track of yakking to be a really really big deal again look at the Golden Garden composition they've got Frontline I've got a mix of damage type center lanes look pretty solid we know again galio yeah he's not to have pressure against Cassiopeia most certainly but he can at least a cat magic this pretty cleanly and feel okay about that one you don't get the Adaptive Helm or an Abyssal mask early on in and it kind of withstand that lane and then just get out somewhere else and feel pretty comfy I've been liking FBI knew he quite a lot overall not going to have a ton of pressure Ash poke is only going to be so good but they can only survive ganked on that side so I look with that look is I'd like the composition of side though we do have another game of Sunday on so you can take over the game is a game right they've gotten him off or on duty since Week 1 and saying hey let's give you some more pressure and if they can have some top pressure come out of the Jungle if they can get contract up there for some game Sunday to Monday night games like usual and it's is really interesting too because Golden Gardens were hovering the super hard Lane counter of Quinn into an accident and I use the dash you try and interrupt and they went with a can in it can be a much harder Lane counter if you go attack speed on hit Kennen and you go a deacon in but it's so much more important to the team overall that he go a pee for their v e v that I'm very curious to see how important they value shutting down Sunday specifically he is build path is going to give you a lot of insight into golden Guardians thinking behind this can infect and sent they didn't go with the Quinn it makes me think that they're going to trying to get by with the Deep earlier levels of you start with a doran's blade and then you can build into Proto belt and you can build into zhonya's and is AP items for the Canon to have it be back before the team fights later but you see I still get the edge of I'm range matchup I have this done so I can come out from my W's and you get your extra harassment of the door in slave girl might see a late invade that trigger wardwell place to spot it it's kind of nice the track most movies out there and indeed there going to try sweeper was in reign gold content about the FBI shared alongside closer ever going to look for that late invade on the bottom side which hey by the way already sniffed out 100 thieves a $0.40 contract to meet outside of this coming Sunday at the concert we haven't helped Amanda Lane you got a flash early instead that's smart there from contracts he does not level inability early when they see Hunter on The Invasion PWC fuel goes for the Sun get to be summoned immediately and that is going to reduce so much of the counter for the lane pick up early on Canon wants to try and harassed Renekton obviously if I hit the door and start you get your Autos off you drop into the frosting dry cleaning a grill but that assumes you so much more difficult now that they have to split the map and he has no flash to be afraid of red stuff can you stuff a math book 4th grade is a faster than the chicken stock and his jungle the same time. Contracts does increase the damage of Tom kench very much does not going to be in too much here easy pick up with the flu for closer once he's done Auto in a couple more times and Gretel for that one down and you can go off next to a camp but they're so yeah we'll keep that roughly one Camp leave for the golden Guardians jungler what comes through later on if they fail up and get more items in and look for those big play yeah you you mentioned the fact you're clearing that's an issue that's exactly vated by the fact that he had to level the burn the flash of Kenan you're not starting W your your first gifts going to be a lot slower there took him a while to do the red you seen on the Triborough Schwarz closed his heart he would tell about to get really dangerous if I can find plastic doesn't know they know that we can keep the damage and yeah that would have been one more strike would have done it have to be respectful is been spoken to help make sure there was a fight happening there hopefully is okay here farm at the second one and those are all the things I like about that kind of chicken in Atlanta Camp Hill PA into the galley oh is that not only do you have really good scaling PPS options for later for the Cassiopeia because she has a really easy pumpkin farm Lane Leon vs galio bite leaves today doesn't doesn't get yanked but my ass is so good against galio now that he can't do no, classes and stuff like that if you set down the stairs only Mobility from galio comes from his stomach hurts Bellbrook used to do with with all the extra speed that can get off and it is Cloak and cycling now is Summoner spells so those are really only like the prize cards that you that you now have to worry about and kept if she has a lot of answers with with holes in my asthma white sauce with heavy up the top and side haunted slightly down and dies with a lot of that is the wave is pushing into him contact Phil wants it all off to die but I just delete EP Fernandez the mid laner forced out of Lane and wanted to get some more down the cake will happen again but it is do you think resting a lot of time into this Sunday we can get them and that's what you talking about fans have been crying for 400 these Champion resources and there's any contracts up there 24/7 repeat ganks this does mean especially since you're playing versus Braves the graves should always take those opportunities to go counter-jumper you closer has done exactly that and has earned himself a level lead up several camps now and you have to start to worry about control of dragons and possible Dragon stacking for Golden Guardians if you invest that much on to the top side of my nose hit their my Sunday in October in both junglers recall closer is up a longsword in gold right now that we've almost exactly two diamond swords that are otherwise the items are pretty close together is holding true pot shop going to reveal what else am I spaghett I just drives me so much more into the mat when when you have these situations like contracts finally getting his Resurgence in the ALCS in his first game against the Golden Gardens with spent two years with him and got Bandstand got traded away I do know that there is there's definitely an extra incentive for him to communicate well prove himself worthy Christina Grimmie singing somewhere closer so just focus on topside I don't expect that to change continue try to focus on some Des Plaines and that would mean and that would also and pay getting ripped failed in 1 and 1/2 minutes because clothes are already for Golden Guardian the movie level leaves and Grace gealey biggest dragon I'll be so I'm going to go for the stars but make sure there's no words in the pit there weren't any Double Take It Down vs a recall for up for affiliate for Cody Sun you can get caught with plug boot for the ash no problem and will be with him through his clothes and wants to the matter at the red goes downtown directions to closer in the farm game stick lotronex beef yep and I guess that's for the repeat games up onto the top side which look at the DS consoles. His flashback and he is CS is still ahead of Sunday who I think I would have arranged to the queue to buy text at 1 but I'm just dealing with the pressure at this bar completely fine that used to go back to school for the clothes for the 2DS leave the dominions the ones that are late knock down and topside is making it difficult to see if dichos do you link charger has been some days when I'm closer going to be on the ward contract is here one earbuds jump over the wall and he's going to wait around for that cool down and there we go he was afraid someone slapping on him in case I am death in the most critical part of that interaction because both sides don't like they were baiting the extra reward their 400 East gave them the confidence that with whom already wrote the bottom side Lisa by himself actually let's see if he gets
beginning never have lost their spot I am glad they're in this last week the entire organization kind of exploded they let go of their GF of their coach and their entire starting LCS rosters what switching with the academy roster stuff as you said the academy roster that's moved up for Mortals now actually has more familiar faces to me than the LCS roster did Ashley with alarm having a scandalous deck segment on Friday is very well on for alarm here going up against Hunter deviljho be difficult but yeah they target band him already with his ergot which he did just play in academyyeah I I probably have a somewhat negative opinion hero valorem now he is physically in a cat a starch right thing is so was Laura Lowe is completely acceptable here as well but he has not been successful in Academy. Roster has three and three of the academy league in Apollo with a lot of heavy lifting after those two are absolutely no standouts on that team would start having a very bad split so far the Apollo talk about it laterall right going straight down the list here or Jana into the Twisted Fate One of the classic story on a man gaining a lot more present and in Europe as well volibear picked up for the golden Guardian definitely still keeping it as a flex by kind of expected to go into the hands of on Sir with the way that golden Guardians have had their identity as a being kind of reach day they had closer on the power climbing big DPS champion from the jungle paired with something that they can come join him within this realm is perfect. That they will keep Steve oliverez if they don't have to reveal yet if it's a top or a bottom and they can actually hold that fix all the way till fishplay the washboard to speed where the ends of going up to see Golden Gardens in support of locked in their middle and bottom line so they need Jungle Top and fixing to pick support first time around and then you know wait till the very end of a couple of are you going to see the start Banning away good fighter top laners is gone but the ergot fan as well that leaves malphite has been found a way that goes for your this month but he has to have arguably to have to cut a quasi blanket to match up against Build-A-Bear can eat at least go in Jungle get rid of the tanks that are good in the Raton Aquatic Center there and there's not really a good match up tissues into fall of there as far as the saying goes but lets you are kind of getting your team and I'm freaking some I like a range backed up to try and use jungle pressure with a range bass up to get them behind so it's not like you can easily have some sort of melee countervolibear in your pocket that's what they do come up with a splitting them between the jungle on top light in here and as you're expecting some of the answers and silver, you know the tank your one that will lock him down Nautilus and Leona are two of the main ones but they actually go with some of this has been taken away from a bilious decent match of overall they're more worried about the loop for the hiding in the back line makes sense but it means again to pull the biggest reflecting pool is very very end of the world going to pick themselves the matchups pool I would say it's still very open building razor up trundle is I think it's a very good pick overall there would not be shocked and just in general speaker Singapore on the champion and I'm a little surprised to with the with the Lulu van like yeah you know there's your kind of worried about late-game buffering of his values but to medirections to work on if the wrist stretches skilled is so good at the blades interrupting the dash is trying to hook to work on afterwards as well when he's a straight line dashing back on the 8th buried always seem like they're pretty easy moves there's about five that you mention alarm at played in the academy and I'll just be the guy and I would love to see a heart that would be awesome I would love to see a lot of come out ABS brutalized with no recourse at all instead mordekaiser build top 5 well that one because it's baking show up as well if you to build Mr Boulevard has plenty of physical self look pretty good in that top play match of overall Immortals going to be gone and Oriana All Foreign gate and are freedepalo and if you spend a good comeback line yeah I honestly think alarm is in a really tough spot here like you're saying they were outside in academy and he has to early pick and also gets a really good counterpick more days so good at grinding down tanks are you take conquer all of your entire kit is basically towards grinding down takes another Bailey matchups so like maybe he didn't and builds one of the lice half damage Bell fights that I don't think that's likely cuz I also think that has a less a lower chance of success plus then gives your team later as they won't have as much of a front line will see how they can get through this one and Apollo are back that's what you're trying to focus. If you started from the beginningout at the beginning of split saying look we scrimmaged all this Define that they had started to split with was the five-day thought had the Best Buy assume the best chance at winning and that has not come through four of those five starters potluck being the exception were top 10 index in the ALCS coming into the week not having a very good start was fine I know he's been getting a lot of flak online I thought he was on the team behind potluck such as it is though they have replaced all five with the academy roster and we'll see this one looks a bit better I think maybe one or more players can mix and match in down the line but this the look and I think it will look better overall they're up against what just got this might be one of three I did Golden Gardens are a pretty strong team that really gives very good things in their shot clinic they are a threat in this league and we'll see if that plays out for that got a pretty fun roster here who's the fake getting all around the map the volibear jungle I'm always a fan of seeing as well that Champions really fun to see haven't played him myself but he's in a lot of my games at schoolreally fun at the hotfix and the extra bucks that were laid down in at 10:12 that's so much more tankiness and damaged and I love the press the attack my personal favorite ruined a lot of people messing around with various movespeed rooms in the face Russian Predators a lot of top winners go conqueror but press the attack if you so much worse damage because you're W applies to stack account says as a hit for it so you can get your W-4 Auto W Auto off of pretty quick one of them being your your que Autos as well so he actually has a lot of up front-loaded damaged and I would be confident taking him into trundle in early duels as well so we'll see how you navigate this cuz closer has been a very good aggressive jungler always looking for invades always looking to play off of any golden Guardians land that is pushing usually with Demonte and usually heading down bottom linewith Demonte as we showed with the stats in the intro slide right now small leash therefore closer what does so much to Red Bluff butsmithy everything blue at least let's hear shouldn't be the worst thing in the world but is just a little slow over all right no help this thing actually has a favorite of armor smithing to pull it all the way over right now and then I'm going to go drop in that is deficient efficiency the name of the game I thought the entire jungle roll is built around deficiency and time spent at least killing or Warden always doing something proactive Mississippi has been one of the best his entire career in the ALCS at optimizing that always trying to get a clearer path that will set him up for defensive options early for his lame in most cases but sometimes offensive ones as to in this case with this chance for life I would say definitely would have to be more Vision independent minded as like I talk about polar bears going to have a big advantage over you closer to the power steering right through and level 3 and food have priority on the box crap. Crap, did you mention the fleet footwork on the mordekaiser Woodruff Preferred Auto which basic guarantees he can like just like walk at you with the auto tax give you the password goes off and enforce alarm to The Runaway the second dose even a trade yes conquerors better in a long-term fight so why not just make sure you can think about it all and you know a little bit of extra Newsfeed goes a long away with the champion in in the melee matchups out the alarm with the comment for malphite might be going a little bit more AP heavy it just helps you out in my favor force allows you to have a decent trade because you're cute slow, basically guarantee you your comment hits especially on those Champions getting a little bit more States before him that's what it is well and apparently we got word I've just been picked the wrong one I think I sent in contact that's a long way you know I don't really good but I still believe it I'm sure it's like the overall win rate to look use weaker Minds The Night Taylor there's a Chase in Flames not going to stop an ocular knew he was going to walk back way cannot just land that roof of hakamo-o could be in danger flashes of demotic covering for the bottom line their know they're still teleport on Insanity cuz he went with the cleanse worried about gold cards coming his way and it really good just in case by The Immortals bottom way and XFinity to be able to get out of that that was teleport for double Summoners off of Pablo not the worst of Worlds and considering they also were able to load of one off of a few key for the 4th at 5 so definitely successful move your bike Smithy did reveal him though and a lot of clothes and go for the NBA MBA diversity hard there was a team around they're going to try Here Comes the Sun there comes the damage closer walkaway cannot trade back maybe a fleet he'll know he's going to turn around at Samantha's going right behind get some damage watch out for the juice out of the side of that one but yeah if you're into this Earth are okay how so that's why I want to be able to put this under the turret as Bowser here and taking it as a one-way trip for sure that you see that color from 6:50 because that's very good with his pillow placement kind of at Legacy trundle player through several different metals and he cut off any sort of Escape classes in there's no way he's getting out of sticks or anything so does trade the kill put alarm steelfield the front of it with some of those text messages going down teleport using immediately by him to get back out the lane so that it's not worse of a CS discrepancy and that's going to mean that golden Guardians have teleport priority once again the bottom line for Mortals is going to have to worry about that for summer. It was Demonte well guess what you still have to worry about the top laner now Hunters level six and has teleport advantage over Aurora which takes away a lot of the possible bite from a hospital play Knockin the controllers 50 still going to farm up pretty close in CS overall they got the Phila killed down there that's going to go first as well both supports on a baby with Ear Force has cleanse get away but honestly I really like the play if you if you can get double supports runs off and force that as Mortals Hears a Who is Shockwave Lance display with Aftershock might just kind of wait for the Kit Kat and he walked in gets hooked to cleanse now as it could be a trade Devante going to fly that is a Reggie special lens the blue card Insanity lives down in the aftermath is still going to be divided they getting a dirty plate and probably a dragon for the golden Guardians as they retreat but that could have been knocked out why for your dog
in the light of promoting Lord that we do need to touch on borreload getting subbed in for dignitas now he was like crunching Academy dignitas Academy you actually was struggling themselves of it but it has been one of these for a long time are set by the you so I don't think I'll be any surprises with him on the team but if you looked on this roster and you were talking about Jonathan and after we've been playing really well recently that you would have Prague Ananda Katie and everything since you came in they should be able to build something off of this maybe they can muster their first win here right off the bat do you crave still open and that is a big Acadian Champion to me when Katie was first in the steam coming up he was playing me the top Raves do Graves like he wasfan of that chance. And now that it's backing lometa I always like to see him pick it up even though they didn't have 6 touch with his previous in Boston right now go ahead and take the Appel yes we're going to grab something high priority for ourselves Twisted Fate is a cat's mid laner use thing that have her right now and likely go over to Jensen no going to pipe at the last second and I really like flying Mages into a filios because he has a lower base in Marseille if you take the Mr snapsort it still worse than if I sit or Calista did that but you're still at a lower margin of the camping might be so often times you can see that for a while and I really wanted us to hold on to the mystery of the enddo the Cassiopeia. I really like it into a paleo diet is that it is really easy to peel and you're my soul and your whole side to his belly else because he doesn't have a lot of trick he has no extra Mobility now they started with a press to give him some mobility and give him some safety wedding photographer. Trying to mitigate some of the counter pink here but I'm a huge proponent of the cat Co and the Sentra pics into a failure specifically poor Lane matchup have to keep in mind all right we need some attack damage elsewhere in our top to balance since we're facing orange one of the Premier super to take that is really going to be able to itemize very efficiently if you stacked too much AP currently with the Blitzkrieg pick up you look good are they are definitely going to need some 80's red to the last Tuesdaythrough the first phase of fixing bands Kindred May well be the second band coming out here as well Liquid Swords GZA 4th they know this was his face in the midline they know it's going to be Jensen up against Rock to drop off the counter picks might be good against it but you seem to Cotati are actually Banning away Fitzwilliam is top laners like the atrox take away the vet voiced as possible here that is still available to and Ice cool white like a set you know Xfinity for set for a blade of the ruined King either one of those version both are super popular provide good initiation for the very well with your liquids current 3 pics as well as being that physical damage threat so maybe they can follow it up with the Step Van hereYeah Yeah Yeahs any other physical damage top laners Gangplank of course it'll grow back if he certainly hasn't been Champion you know he can bring it out licorice play Gangplank so far as the split so you can do better in medical center that impact likely has practice on it if he hasn't played it yet so visible damage has to come out of one of those two lanes because of how do you have to front letter so far respecting and mail a jongleur for them as well and stacking Mr would be a danger. So I have to be the match up not just physical top laner taking it up a notch at the least ality talk later write this really put the extra pressure on I I really enjoy this picture of Olaf that is going to be a power Duo. 9 have used it totally, really just doors up the later stages of the game for Ola fit tapered off.Kirby unlock Well normally drop off later and not be able to keep Pie as effectively when carbon provides everything Olaf watched especially if you're building a, correctly might do and be does with you theme semi-hard inspector and just trying to use your meeting to materialise Urton Lane I don't really enjoy this compost but we'll see if I think both pops have a really big bro's to them I definitely like like the match up here most of the slip through the Picton bandana mean physical damage top in Jungle Mattituck in the mid and bought side for Team Liquid I know the very beginning a chocolate to cats house hoping to build Austin successes from their bottling to liquor off of a very strong early game and it's all a bit to get in the Cloud 9 just yesterday I could easily move up to 4 and 2 to put them around second or third place in the early it is not what a one-loss teams left inflyquest might be the only one about honor and so I certainly can can be at the top of the standings in the second and I like what you could have done with this trap it gives them a lot of options for them out playing and then creating a space on their opponents this is not a sit back and relax Team Liquid team cop they need to get on it early here and they have the tools to do it all right we are on to the red what it's going to this game is going to be exciting what is dignitas takes on Team Liquid unfortunate start here for dig but they're going to change the roster around Laurel o steps into the Top Lane for Viper and they're open. Is going to be the little bit of extra that they need as well as back the discount is built around Johnson and aphromoo in the bottom side is Johnson has been great has that price of Helios to let it go for an early invade spotted out very early Ward coming down TL known on this brush The Haunted Hathaways my way in herepaycheck doesn't look like any danger though cuz they didn't go the Deep route on the invade and he would make the quick pass through to drop off the ward hear the one big thing that they have to worry about is the Olaf if not for the Olaf Team Liquid will just run over this early game if so many options with Twisted Fate plus lease in providing crowd control for the lease in to get in there for an effective gank Jay's Place lease end also can be super effective early and of course the blitzcrank on bottom side trying to capture pick into the flds dress combo so that's why I say he liquid this is not their normal sit back and relax we're going to scale up to later 45 they have been drafted themselves so many options so many tools to create action for the fan ceiling fans free really like tracking Olaf jungle pathing we got a KTM doing pretty standard drops to the 2nd right through that key was he finishedover and save a little time right there obviously a lot of damage to my mother's Olaf I want to track how fast he gets that level up right we had bladder getting ugly was level 4 at under 3 minutes then getting halfway through cruggs by you know before the 3-minute mark so I got to see the Katy can make that would happen for himself obviously incredibly probably pass through the jungle is could always remain ahead of the opposing side taxi and told at the top of his money back and forth in fact the key of course as pretty much everybody is well aware of now with her lots of getting yourself in potentially extremely low off the blue and drop some people will use their W early like as soon as I get to love with you but if you want to go as low as possible for the extra tax lien mean while be a top-down clear out for rocks are on the lease in and he's not going for the super super early influence their off of level 3 I think he's going to do more of a full clear if youstart to get behind in levels to olop Which Wich can feel inevitable at least it because people are so fast to be time to really really difficult to actually go make your offensive plays without 100% hours of where Olaf is because you have a good kind of game to get smashed in it and he's been really needs to pray off of those balls level 305 Rick 18 by the way is the mark they're going to talk to see Lisa and not a fast the jungle in is not going to help his team if you can watch him helping tea on the bottom side trying to fight for scuttlebutt it means there is a level lead for taxes potion does not have that with that I can you set and go for the top down clear yet again can you please do so we can see the drop respawnbasketball for it they got some reveals they're not there anymore but realistically if you want a flash follow that's good at least one slice of a Jensen again will get top speed of a problem and then to go for drop the top 10 clear that little Skirmish there are bottom river is exactly why I recommend the more full clear for Lisa's and not wasting sometimes trying to steal away into sneak away and don't have a way from Olaf because he's clear so much faster he's always going to have his level for advantage over you unless you have a really powerful lead in mid and bottom for both of them to the last debate we win the crap for you you're not going to do with a fight them off it and can we could make an attempt at it went to the blue and then that you sometimes trying to send again to trap. Because this early you don't have that extra priority either if your land has never been slain that is one camp that Roxas does not have that by comparison of Kayden is already clearvia the maps that is a golden egg recall comes in just below five minutes I'm going to fight for uncle and this first-rate we'll see if that one comes down KTM on the earliest record Wrangler certainly doing well three camps ahead Chuck Lorre low write him vs. impact Top Lane is going I think just fine when you're the or early game but honestly holding up pretty well and honestly with the extra minions in front of his Tower he might be able to selectively so then and catch right back up I took it a lot by the help over here we go big Play Already Here Comes, they've got rights in the council comes through first blood it's somebody say bottom layer free because afro blue and Johnson have been doing everything they can to get dinner talk on the board with the winning the ALCS and they do it againteleport is channeled by frog and just to ensure that they can get that killed but man that was all Johnson and afro move to pln Tactical get that bill and this is weird fact about having class here to do just the good news from Africa flashing in with the play and then looks like she's not want to disappoint you. Already got into the slow of play I have a good if you plant an apple still hook you in the death sentence then tell me how you did but you're probably going to die next time to in a Flash so absolutely perfect gun was up there for place as well so we had to follow up route like realest me they were just too much ground control to deal with and it was a nice black play exhaust guaranteed it exactly after I moved back on track feels nice to see him making some big plays and now it's this way to you can see I'm trying to ask you to help out with the Visions fire boom as well as throwing down the wards around it for froggingplay there's a light special and has always been able to kind of the exact playing like they'll pause and a new via a lot of these more often at a champion. Super heavy Farm only stayed and rain but you're taking up a Karma looks like he's going to be building for the same as well drilling for Acadian I like this new look uses his first teleport early down bottom side just to ensure that it's a good bottom land something definitely gets the kill and he's playing a lot more for yeah I would say I would totally agree with your sophron constipation I think I always though he has been one who plays many champions are number one of those conversations I have with him when he came to North America play the LCS he said hey what do you want to I want you to guess my highest win rate Champion Pro play and that Ori I know it was that you at 3 and then back into a 2014 playing on Elias well it was funnyulcs with Alliance so low and behold nice angered boxes I know there's nothing you can do about it but he butt dialed you play them right back out flat for Jensen back in the brush shields on again knocking for Lauren aquilina. The kill shot glass turns around 4 today tries it for good measure but either way it seemed like there was a fight to the one I like the accident here that's attempted getting into historyplay dark and I have any events at 2 kills on to the JC ER for impact it looks like he's actually going to go the more Amana build as well so shut the early tier and additions usually Valatie this extra
sexy week or teams and and yet a lot of different elements need to get short up here the draft part of that look like that and kind of well you were ahead but you had the best early game team ever in your against the best liking team ever worn a fellios Oriana like that is flaking powerhouses that they actually had and it getting some point in the game where you supposed to be dominating you taking over and hitting these you know kind of Unstoppable points and how to play with the team fights what your ring conditions are and that's piece to a lot of inexperienced right yes they do have some players that have been around for a really long time I'm not sure exactly who is Shah calling in and what is going on there with The Mortals but they are are struggling pretty heavily they were predicted to shovel pretty heavily I think it's fair to say coming into the split after the roster changes were revealed but it's like yes they playtop three teams but they finish what second third and regular season like they were right up near the top so they are supposed to be supposed to be competing consent in at least having close game so the schedule gets easier for them the expectations are just going to get higher you know you should be able to beat out Immortals based on and what people were thinking we were going to get it from this hundred piece quad okay well on the game is still very nice to hear also a very well see pot looks like the first time this is Levi picked up on the immortal side on a map to go to so as it's probably going to be down there for Altec and you can probably do pretty well down there a potluck actually isI'm surprised with the orange bandanas generally if you're going to be picking trundle you want to see an orange you know you're pretty happy about that has to do with dildos that the way is often the team that is picking or in that actually began to tremble instead of the opposite we are getting here of that being said no four of the six games with these two top layers can blind have been on duty and maybe there are feeling like a Sunday is more flexible than so as do I set you on to the top, take that away from him so I will see if they're able to really kind of exploit that's not playing at all with some of the danceall right well I kind of like what happened to drop so if you look at the kind of the the story told by Katy Perry's real talk to me as real band 41 Eclipse to go ahead and play that we don't care because is what we're setting up or sitting up trundle never to play xayah rakan way to pick the champion of soap from 10.25 pretty fun pretty strong overall and does okay we were happy to take it let's go for this one we got our front front line between got great lake in damp and so far I super love let you meditate while I will say the Champions are free happy to play them in Nicholas that usually would not love to play into Leona Leanna has always been kind of considered one of the really good dancers and desire gone unique and very often walk down this work on when he jumps forward sometimes helps a burst them out you can follow him back onback on the shielding on to the diet though there are some good options there and I do think that I'll take gate if they can execute well if you have the potential to look for things like all ins and try to lock down and kill office for consew thus far though Immortal throwing more bands towards the Top Lane you know they are expecting with the R&B band out that some dude want to go for some of these Lane bullies we have not been seen my true calling at all in the ALCS popped up on the Family's couple times but it is a strong Diwali style top laner that can really carry games volibear is also so they are removing those there are still things such as the atrox available but they are going to take that away and now I'm excited in will someday be willing to pick something a little bit more aggressive Willie go to a floor jacks or something a little bit more interesting unit Fiora to try to slam this one V one or is he just going to kind of get a little bit more standardI will say is a pretty highly prized top laner globally is one of the more common ones out there but certainly is an aggressive fighter this is a matchup I'm expecting some day to win based on the players from the Champions. I will come into something else around this game or y'all going to locked in for a ride so some very stocked in our team fighting out of xayah rakan orianna and the trundle X Factor out of Sunday's Brixton and now he is a year so a lot of power in that midlane definitely we did see the reactant it'll work out well the one time it got brought out for somebody in Spring had a pretty nice game on it and has been fairly successful on it overall as you say I do think that the Oriana on a combo is very powerful is very standard can you have the trundles to try to shred through some of the front line here and I do think of the late game is going to be very very nice four hundred Thieves for the same time there is a pretty powerful they came here with youon the side of a mortal's to have pretty good engagement play making with the Leona as well as this lease in so they're going to have their opportunities to but I do think a hundred thieves both have any of the better late game and easier to ask you cam position so it is going to require I think something a little bit special hear from Immortals if they are going to able to pull this one off throughout this year have special things know the roster is a lot different from when that was happening before but you can still hold out hope I I still have that that box that that should have back pockets idea that so ask him pull out some Miracles that he stole a very good player overall not showing a whole lot this blip but I know he's got it in him so that is where a lot of my eyes are I'm kind of curious what the top Les match's going to look like over off and what we can get later on from The Immortal composition filigree if you do the heimlich on a few favored execution deals how did these favor then I still like they're dropped quite a bit so we are on a rep for our last game of the weekmorning if you're late enough in the time zones and let's do it again ourselves here it is it is always a bit concerning do when you're looking at a game and you're saying alright your win condition Immortals the guy we're looking to is so as to beat someday who had the counter pick and also just look at how they perform the last couple years right you know someday I was in the running for the best top laner of the league in Spring Isle Liquors did Edge him out in the voting but there's going to be some really really high expectations for someday again coming to the summer that he did really struggle in the spring split playoffs to be fair that was a pretty big light down for a lot of hundred these fans as you know people are kind of saying yeah this is going to be someday proving everyone wrong on the voting and he's going to slam liquor and then he kind of got blasted and is now looking for some Redemption coming to the summer split in and try to perform again at the high-level it because he saw himself as best top laners Leagueacrylic can be done there are 15 games to play in the regular season this is one of them see if the road Redemption Starts Now is b03 start obviously not what either he wants but he leaves for potluck over there going to be a solo job for me dies down here they're both going to get the red bumps that particular time from a really good at 11 that the heart beating analysis even in love with us today and one team can win one keeps going to lose at three games have been played 15 games left you know why I thought it you know I was really good at most basic math precalculus course Relic Shield the most common for the vast majority Pro Sports because it's way more reliable for gold and some are very nice he's playing, so it is kind of more looking tothose Early Trades you can also see that you know by the cool down on his crafting potion there when he popped it how you going to be playing time warp Onyx so a very likely you know time warp Onyx porch, and all these things are often about winning those Early Trades it's much more focused towards that and I would expect you to be winning those trades in the early Lane when you're playing against someone who is FaZe Russian very likely appoint Gathering storm in front of them worse feeling rude that's really pushing the Box light right here it's going to be at the end of the third wave of captivating that's always cool because it's not always do a boyar often Under Pressure Brewing opposing Lane and plains are fighting somebody Jukes away from the knock back and took his tractor going it's going to be a big heavy trade there in the middle and yet again if we're going to get the trading heavier it is available for real Moto E4 make it look the TV back and you are always in a little bit of a dangerous situation right after you teleport because if you get gang post he becomes very very punishing, but Wyoming out back in Lane here you don't want to spend too much is a minor thing but this is something that actually sometimes people mistake and make us a mistake a lot if you face first as though leaner and spend your TP to get back it is safe to assume generally your opponent is going keep you back soon and sometimes you'll see if he will be back in a lane and immediately spend all their spells on their opponent in like I pushed you out but it is essentially wasted right after you and teleport back to and then you don't have those resources for when I come so I click it right on the right now he's down at what twenty 30% Nana and I was returning at a full moon so he's going to reset one more time in this case is that makes a kind of okay because you were just looking to continually reset but just something I see I see a lot of players sometimes misstep on for sure if you trade that okay can you back like an outage on my Lane so I can shove safely in this case of dementia and yes it did work out but I've seen that one of these back to our guys goes 50 health and I got to get back to Laney's when I get the money right now thanks bud and yeah I've seen the really extremely bad version of that overran in probably two for right now for now bottom Lane yeah you're seeing a pretty big for me to Cody's on Sunday if she does Winnie trade but I know he is winning the trade that he is struggling to have you know that perfect Farm while doing so and that's something we know that I've seen what I've gone back and kind of watched him for views of his in the past but they are looking for this bottling tank hear potluck moving down flat roof going to find the dueling will stay alive it is 37 Asbury Avenue mortal side to down for under these Cody sun will be an easy target because they claimed they were too early to be thinking that hay under these Bali in June it back off here to this is our only opportunity to try to go for it now they did get some pressure there which is why is here remember cast The Flash thing for the leash him if he's not going to say they don't have to buy us the immortal do I had already taken the recall First wall texture time for round the first to move go get it after all is bright going to be no problem is he doesn't really work out but the bottom line pressure and they use that to take the dragon so still pretty happy with that play overall if you are Immortal but a hundred thieves here back in time to farm this stuff and they can either fries or pushed for they do desire so I was getting pretty low up here on this top side doesn't pull back in though yeah yeah baby yeah I saw him move a little bit Drake thankfully it's because the other bottle in Her Dream by either you can put them out or you know they took a recall timing if you go straight it means you missed your rehoming which means that the guy and you're in League with nothing and you just believe the lane until you take a battery call yourself what Altec to get minutes to do was get their own recall then once they're back in Lane with a band Pepper or longsword in Boots stuck in the gang come forth to recall before he spent your money it's fine we can then stay afterward the film The Wave take the Drake it's fine to go back it again at the Publix first then they did all those things that allowed them to have a fairly efficient kind of path around the bottom Lane and I think that's really intelligent when you consider the fact that Clifton looking for a BF recall any way right so just kind of AFK farming set 1353 goldmark and then basing alongside desire did not beneficial for the Kalisto no getting back on that 900 gold for the answer's going to be feeling pretty good some day 20 of them these trees pretty healthy up here on the top side but I was out videos that could be pretty hard to actually you'll follow through in it dive that eat rocks and see if they have 10 right now is the waves will not quite receptive some days man cumming Georgia past week and want to keep them out of the media is going for this Harold up in the fit and because I have no preference to be in danger but it's okay they can make a great you're going to go for a form and I but instead why are they even arrive because I actually stayed around I think if you just wait for you to use your pen for a great shows up
is a couple of samples back and forth a nearly had that to go start to be dignitas date almost had to whatever liquid the shock to me was I lost the counter logic gaming and we hope they can find a way to turn around here it's been back-to-back kind of poke composition losses for Golden Guardians you know ntl they did get a pretty Monumental advantage in the early game closure has been on these power farming in a dominant really junglers than Italy twice the Braves once but you know both those little league games were paired alongside things like Zoey and Chase and asriel and they have actually been good at closing out those games feels like they know how to play in the early game but they're not as confident in a playing out those competitions around objective 10 and not as sure how to close out the game so I'm going to use the app and going for and try to call it that up or if they will revert back to what actually got them the win their first game of the season against thing. Which was much more of a team fight Center composition know featuring Kai Sangrefrontliners so I'm going to be actually see where they take us very on the same now we're going to drop it off the table going to go to the first take on Ezreal instead he's gone you don't get that really fun combo but still getting a forest a high price pot later at fellios to the most obvious answer with Varys and Calista off the table this kind of rounds out the 80 or so no shocks in the pic so far I feel really is just see if bladder will just take me to Lee away from closer going to that have been his most highly prized jungler a volibear another really important grab here that has been getting a lot of attention and pick FANUC 10t Flex pop or jungle we have only seen it top I do believe but I really liked it as a jungle pick also have been playing at I've quite a bit out of the Jungle and don't feel very strong there too so it will be interesting to see where Blythewood takes up and if golden Guardians want to go back to that Natalie because it is availableand it would be taken themselves up for you know another pokedoll composition but TF is actually spoke with style more what they kind of got the win on in Game of her one which was there an echo game and it has been you know getting a lot of attention it so far in the LCS do we have any of that is also popular than the other regions and it does feel like people of people are still adjusting to this pic they are not always responding appropriately to the global pressure but it does have you know not always taking consideration when TF could be holding in and I will be there to see if you can kind of improve on that throughout the split well galio going to be answering Global pressure with some Global pressure for Theatre ultimate is either side lane themselves Cloud9 immediately start batting away the champion you thought might have been to steal away as in Italy is off the table the volunteer as you mention of licorice ison a damaged Focus Champion 2 games on Jace a game on GameFly with his second board game of the foot and last time we did say he actually gravity Gallia was alongside the Olaf but they had this whole kind of composition did that was focused on on helping out flavor in the jungle right midline Dad Gangplank in the Top Lane that was able to Alton help him if it is trundle you can do similar thing to always a pretty highly prized picked into things like the orne but the struggle is much more on the supported side compared to what we had seen blabber do. So this is going to be a bit of a different look here from Cloud 9 no tuning this is jungle trundle this would be toppling Volver very likely and there is a slight possibility of black sitting around but that is what I'm expecting in this feels much more all about then and then his teeth by damage because it is a composition that is actually quite lowon TPS where is Golden Guardians have any threat coming out here it feels mostly about the Affiliates and protecting him and they do have an incredible amount of Peel but yeah it is a composition that if it falls behind a little bit can be worrisome you know having enough damage actually get things done and golden Guardians are going for this proposition that can pop up anywhere you've met long-range engage from the orange and the ultimate can all get dropped to pick up anyone from Cloud 9 who's looking to fight in the jungle is looking to fight in the side lengths and this does feel like from Golden Gardens that is designed to scrap and to be Cloud 9 where they look to fight you because any team that was have a chance against Cloud 9 is going to have to be willing to take those bite you cannot sit back and seat objectives give up everything that I want to fight or they will run you over in a big thing I want to point out is that knocked her and has a really favorable matchup around the galio you turn the lights off and he can't get back to your teammates when TF says hey let's go killStelios and the light turn out from closer you don't get to let nisky show up you don't get to teleport down there from liquor ocean of Oliver he no longer has the hell it's just then and Vulcan hoping it's going to be enough in the fellas doesn't always have the tools to cut it out so I really like what Nocturne does right there I'm a little surprised that band didn't come out as a champion that we will see occasionally and end does have some favorable interactions when you see if y'all you a bit yeah it is a really good point you know I think it's a lot more pressure on those Cloud 9 solo laners to teleport instantly you have to make such quick decisions against Nocturne if you see the other Steve Hot Springs like you think you're about to engage if you see going to teleport coming from author he's got to be so fast and make sure you can get that off before the Nocturnals might come through that's also where is on Golden Guardians back to you quickly on that to not have telegraphed plays to Hidden that you're going to be looking for this so that cloud 9 hopefully for their sake can't respond appropriately because if you're not able to get that clean engage off and the galio comes in the trundlethere's an all these Champions are creating space for the event he is definitely a player and he is definitely on the Champions I can run over to invite you to get the right gun to the right situation he is the perfect champion in a in that spot when you're on sniper Nocturne or snipe him for melee range would like red gun here you know so that is kind of the fellows that will be another piece to add some extra body parts go to his money left on the table but they're pushing it and actually to make it a second thought I was just so smart with how they play out the early games they recognize they have way more power than this or Nocturne combo with a volibear and the trundle and I both these Champions effectively Auto attack reset to use the Valverdeyou have the Q R S T from the trundle that is not a match up that you're going to win to be to there as golden Guardians live got a completely give that up close and have to walk all the way across the master to leashless Red Bluff which obviously is doable but already you're delaying that level 6 you know has that Nocturne in this is something that cloud 9 is to really good at kind of doing into peeling a part of the wind conditions of their opponents and we talked and go up against EG yesterday we saw how how hello Barbara this week just TP back to Lane but it is Ghost Fern types of Damages going to force me to get a burn to teleport to the late early and it is a great release a Pokemon deck light off in that range vs. melee matchup galio in the early levels doesn't really have a lot to trade back with so very well play there by Demonte buthow heavily they shut him down played the Six delayed this geylang a nestling that they're going to want to try to do here with closer to delay the level six much as possible track him Post 6 and we're going to see licorice off them that early trading on the Bolivar this is a very advantageous match up for volibear into a torn and it becomes one of those those games were again whatever is going to have no pushing topside that is going to allow him to get aggressive but now find out here level 2 3 Camp easy sun liquor if she's moving fast but there's almost no way flash keep flashing at the wrong time is licorice got a way to give the old school. Let thumbs up fat gang should have been better yeah but I don't even think he had it you would look up after one on one of those minions dying so they needed for Absol bit more patience and now blabber going to try to make a pay on the bus side last follow easy stuff flashes lightcomes through bladder is on the show them how it's done had a very well done mom said before utilizing the pillar noted for thousand additional move block essentially there has been even holding onto the paper, not try to shoot inside son you didn't quite have the range but I'm playing that out very very well and already you're paying dividends from that early invade what was or wasn't level 3 for his gang or he would have got to kill then you're down a couple camps already work on that bottom side here it is once more bronston into the pillar Buffy I has got a kind of like water through a heat blocks with you where's the blacksmith in the top-flight licorice temporarily down XP the hits for I believe the minion died as he was next to the wave and light goes out okay foryeah very well done and it said the extended trade-in or has rate of front damage in a with with his birds and we were talking and brittle into these melee matchups especially you can have a really nice Republic of the trade but as the trade continues conqueror stacks for the Volver you get your second W out into your ear then kind of hitting into the Eastfield and so on and so forth from the orange statuswhere Volver will really start to win out so y'all just got to be careful that when he goes to his grades he had the ability to disengage afterwards and to make sure that is not going to be a really extended grade where licorice can get the best of it has been sick night is going to runHaymaker make it to pay for Golden Guardians man as Leverage The Bottom Lane liquor store to hear TV coming back in this is going to be quite the fight for Hui FBI's in danger but he's a look at it back as posted faith comes over at least for some Vision as well as punch comes in and that's going to be pretty solid good fight there gold on the bottom line is really nice from Golden Guardians just great presence of mind to know you can actually go for that fight you know you're the TV from your top cleaner you know Demonte has level six and can look to join up so they make a Punnett a pitbull a little bit of a roaming Mission getting some boards down and then feeling a little bit to save a little bit too confident get caught by that flat available there for who he is and is able to class of back in and just barely get enough damage with that ignite true damage plus the W true damage shooting with that Center belowYacht Club 9 will be able to trade back and grab a first dragon in this game is a little bit less Farm Centric on the junglers bladder getting a couple minutes later Dragon City often get Saint Olaf obviously gave not trying to prove a shape but obviously trundle a different Janet Roloff does different things include much left quickly but who yes he's never spoken of Kavita in the thing that really triggered it exactly that forever word 315 pop left for your screen they saw where the Brom was both them was walking across that as soon as they saw the meatly licorice with the quick TP because blabber is moving down but they don't quite have the damage here you know the horn comes through land to double knock up if his first down licorice you had a flash so he just gets absolutely lit up and with the F able to pop that ultimate there as well there was a chance we could be spicethis is great stuff my support set can sun and and you know intro to talk to their to get more profit so I think he's doing really well this is great stuff out of the Golden Garden bottom leg I think Demonte sport got canceled by Misty I think he popped the button with a call I can't show because it is he's going to hit me with this one but regardless this is now in early gold lead to Golden Guardian blabber is going to go ahead and get his own stunts the jungle they're going on at Redbox this is the first so far afield close game minute when every time but it is good to see other teams leveling up to the elephant s plug on a gameopposition is going to get really bad really quick here because there's such Reliance on his damaged and obsolete dominate in that bottom Lane. A lot of times over this past year but just the fact that you'll they are not ahead is a good thing for Golden Guardians and you're going to continue to look to keep that Global pressure off which I'm really is respecting right now and misky obviously was not in position to to match any sort of gang just yet so is Venom Hulk in just completely backed off the tour waited for the way it's come to the farm have the rod of Ages done for them onto waiting for the combined cost of money here is the Feast of protobelt or inhibitory Fitness key obviously going to try to follow ensure that four people are there to hit blabberquite sure what library was thinking you know maybe thought that this key would be able to get the alt out sooner and then that bite would look different but let's be honest the bottling for Golden Gardens was closer to that fight was already there you know TF has his Aldi and he was not in position to be interrupted by Nicki so that wasn't very poor fight to actually take from bladder and just being some of those mistakes. Ken
liquid in the opening game or maybe there was a little bit too much for a couple people in the past and we can keep watching them for the table here I want to see how much they can do the Bigfoot been trying to play a lot better and we'll see you at Mass can bring to the table from stocks that on the analysts said so you know just last night we are they Dairy Center and they did lose in Academy but they've been kind of switching time and both of them vying for that position so we shall see what it turns into this game right side of Korra flyquest you got a band out from the highest Priority Care he's very cyclists are the two most band of that s t r Bennett of course it falls down no to the Azrael and a fairEOS button on the side of TSM a lot of focus on support pics here tryna been away some of those big laning supports their uni of course with Spam healing nobody ever want to play against that and then the parkway Making the Band table for now but yeah it's dropped easy early pic onto syndra this is still an incredibly highly prized Champion revali's talk about with that chap of courses so flexible and can play at bottom Lane Wednesday things me to rotate it but this is this is PSM and if it is his most play champion in 2020 he is undefeated on it still five wins on the syndra also has a crazy all-time records that will affect him todepends on it mean while Flight Risk is scaling package of no one actually flexes syndra like technically LuluAlexandra simulator and then like is the like the interesting switch up like 99 to 1 in the throat and roll it's just a bit later and remodeling but it's not even like your body flame player of course I can't afford to take 73 games in his career so more bands coming through though before troll hear from the fewest and they lock in the engaged for for bowel Frost and speak against the run it back on Glisan I know surprise after the performance yesterday yeah I want to see the kind of thing goingreally like to swing on the whole another good one out here today against this feels like a really tight battle screens mother really really top teams it's going to take awhile to figure out exactly how everything has taken us three undefeated teams right now who all it really really scary but talk to you and them is that honestly should be in the hat that you could be able to drop Ramen I want to know which one is going to find a second loss today because I think they're both deserving of positive win rates overall in the ALCS Empower people after the Cinderella was taken away as well they're still want to play that one again and put on there on a backline Carrie and did you notice the LeBlanc band freak so it's definitely respecting the send reflect their ability down to down to doublelift and don't want to get surprised with a terrible LeBlanc pick in the end and they will save their last pay4 power of people a lot of sense that you know the main character of the team especially since match is being subbed in and they drafted a triple Frontline it has grade engage ability to shred the enemy front line however puts a lot of pressure on Match is being sucked in a long will power be able to be there to carry team and play safe with today overreacted analyst behind the times and it was actually on the boulevard train already and you would rather I just wanted to surprisetell me more. This is probably going to be the tanks It Again lyrics and has been spamming it and I talked about it yesterday but you go after shock you feel Tanki early on you or your drain has no limit on the targets for the W so you can easily shove the wave over and over and have a bunch of sustained and then pukes in can look to you both side lengths try to make plays with the ultimate again like a highlight in the last game vision is your number one priority when you're playing the champion till 6 now has another passive on the Q wear if you're out of dishes out of combat / 2.5 seconds you get extra fears with whatever damaging ability and then you can still use your targeted fear that he wants someone elsejust yet and I'm sure that you got coverage on right into this one so fair trade Motors going to be like at full HP forever I thought they could be a drain site that the Orleans going to want to listen to that one plays out overtime still going to be a very exciting match between these things because I'll be certainly flyquest got to see was going on right there. To watch the game from yesterday they knew it was available in the draft they said they knew take photos to be a possibility and they're right side is it okay as long as we are, and what Pixar left available is here is the one here then wait and see what happens and then try to go to the rain gauge it is popular and so like you like I said I've seen this keep playing it as in addition to barracks and so are getting some time in on the champ I think you hit the nail on the head I think we're going to see another of the Conqueror of all of bears you can go press the attack from or first damage but you're fighting itone more sustain looks like we got another three of you it's the grasp for volibear broken play going to get a bit more Tanki when going for those trades storing up that extra HP is going to allow him to play short trade that you're going to mentioning right just just the one hit them back out cuz word might not let it hit for very long time and that one plays out early and so is uniquely fairy weak to Sandra in the one on one of course Leona does not have damaged blocking write can't show teammate can't block me to Braums Shield so at 6 tell if you a lot of damage on believe this should be a safe will take it to her son to go to the queue Mash will be back in Lane in time if used to leash to Blue buffing you do that as wellhello it's Siri about the Solas fairly deep Ward here going to see probably this blue star nobody from TSM was around to see him place that Ward okay that can definitely matter here is solo going to be slowed broke a blade not going to get to slap but hey how far is he control 3 control C control 3 in of dance I am available to you right there got to take those opportunities are important to finish the channel on that because you get 60% of the cooldown refunded to finish it or kill off stuff and you also have a big burst damage at the end but I don't even care to automate I'm going to be like a minute anyway you're not going to do anything meaningful who cares about this one in the big thing is getting all three main lights first on the second wave that can you go to first love to all in there is trunk one there's trunk to sinner part place in a second he's going to have it and you can see how far run respect with the Reagan who look like and you also see you know who gets the duty of killing off the minion himself right I ignore trying to press up letting Mash tag last one because the one that's I need to cool off the initiation there people try and get into range for for the timing but everybody well aware of the level to power Spike it's been talked about for years I know a man who did I also feel like you I highly recommend sew-in no tank Fiddlesticks if you get Auto Field to Midland because it does remove some of the like mechanics do you normally have to pull off in in Midland and your objective is a lot clearer with this Champion specially for me and Uncle are you taking me opportunity to counter jungle while we've got a top Scuttle being taken by Speaker that's very important vision and safety for volibear on the top side of the map so that Broken Blade can play aggressively in this matchup it's one of the things you want to take advantage of from your champ select where you're able to get that has vanished with the ghost text cuddle as well as steal away most of the opposing Raptor Camp speaker can I get one more small chicken compared to know he's very efficient Gangsta we didn't waste any time sitting in that tribe Rush ignorant mediately I guess you're all in on to file Frost through a sphere at mash and then tried to stun I think I might need to see the replay to see if he actually got this done on his Scout of the week though it looks like only the slow and that would pause some of the damage delays some of the follow-up from Mash. Here's another look at it right out of the brush he just got ya right out of the box of fries combo on to buy I'll do the emote stacked up the first Blood passive email already has a good job by him as we have a small coffee early game you can see a gigantic Farm Lido to Broken Blade toppling does not look fun for fill a suorin right now to do a broken play definitely can be an outstanding later and one of the players that can take over again from the top side all right back out on the maps speaking valve Fox kind of work together to invade and get some Vision they walked over a lot of words that were previously placed by flyquest Osos and turn won't be caught off-guard and should know to sweep as he's walking through his own jungle I'm walking the dog right now in a pair and we'll see if Central and Cody run has stopped him in time no vision I believe in this brush but to be afraid down here ignores says hello it's he's old, please. Rain for the rest of the wall just in the right spot and by the way Center in right behind them singing Sun comes out look at the counter gang it's beautiful on a double kill you know the trailing information of the flag plus towards that speaking valve entered on to go on this long path towards bottom sides giving flyquest enough time to set up a reaction here now to kills on to match with the counter gank ear for fly Quest plus sent to her and gets beat down this dragon with nobody intervening huge huge start now for flight Quest Deluxe double thumbs up by the way from Santora's Awards of the walls again California speed rained in the truck coming through Pearson not a problem but he's slow and he's going to rain she'll stay alive the truck comes down to triplets going to fall great. Can't go bottom because bottom just got turned around on them so takes the opportunity to still look for a proactive play there's another look at a Santorum coming down over with the blast, though as soon as I see biofrost centaurs already in position they know he's here rebs might they just annihilate him there with your failures and then really nice pillar as well from santorin they get the double on the mash you get subbed in from Academy and boom double kill already free 10 minutes on Ophelia's Masters got to feel great already upgraded Surfer grease on top of the BF sword yeah beneficiary some really smart. Play by the squad I want to know who called for what the jungler just knows back when you can get the time sometimes that's just the hood of Ace in your back pocket that no one realized without trade still the top side yoga smell back he's been in that one solo finds fight really the slow not getting
but it moves you see that building up these minion wave going for dyed keeping up the pressure proactive Play constantly looking to progress their game State Court there wind conditions and coming to game number for here let's see if they can close it out or if Cloud9 could force the decisive game at number five as we build up towards the end of the lock-in tournament this weekend now the band has been fairly similar we got some changes here with a case of finally being taken off the table which of these now on the blue side as well as the your native Brooks has gone back to yep to Leah right now is up with the debate is up Cloud 9 but you know what to Ponte pants don't work till just play Rise and we just rather get rid of some of the Sunday Champions problem is Camilleif we on the table though many will pick this one off and that means he's going to be really comfortable on a very very strong ad jumper and you are going to really have to worry about Twisted Fate as well okay, I already jumping on a day if seen this before from hundred thieves walk in to leave early on they always try and follow it up with a du-rag a Leo or a Twisted Fate so that you had CC set up from your Midland you also can transition to the other parts the side lengths does Bill a very flexible roll for the squad can go into the Camille can be Flexin to support role for who he is well he's been extremely good at creating plays with it they do have to worry about their bottom Lane pick your 480 Carey cuz it's Twisted Fate play it's going to be looking for that perfect Camille can transition to picked as well so you probably are going to be forced to do a cleanse Bic for FBI here considering you do you know they're going to have Vulcan on TCC as wellalmost certainly that the metagame really is you know teams are just picking hard rock and roll down at the port at Cave reduce the enchanted up those teams are going for that one there is definitely going to be a support who beat the band away the second phase so often if either grab a movie is on I would say is most comfortable support support I think it's great that support actually was what. Who he recognized last year and really started Propel him for stardom for the support role extremely good at utilizing the next flash plus extra speed to chase down people set up voice for the depot. I'm really excited about is the jack big again for someday fry number to a little bit of redemption in early game last time didn't receive a lot of attention and was picked on did not take advantage of the exact advantage over Camille single match up in the top side of the map where one of the big things about Camille in your trading pattern in Lane is trying to get your auto attack offrock your Shield or your dad is shield with Dax the biggest part is of course your Counter-Strike you can't get your auto attack off working me up so you never get your Shield frog and he tasted you. He automatically wins at trade with a difficult things to work around and your Bump back on your hook shot it's not long enough to bump him out of the car strikes done range until he has a really good trump card and a lot of these trade pics level six that really becomes a brute to try and try and handle but and isolation that can be a strong theme for the rest of this graph a compliment that because apparently Cloud Nine already sitting on global pressure which with the state makes that difficult to take advantage of Camille can do a whole lot more than half as well of course but it seems like a lockdown Incredible 2 combo with CF very very good. Games pretty reliably was hookshot going over walls to make that happen so can be a tough one they are we do not have tank right now in the Cloud 9 sign there might be brokenone is Misfortune is locked in here for the counter picks down there had a deep when I lock in the rest of their bottom line is I got to figure out what they want to play a lucky composition again I think I had those were pretty well I get the app for adults as you just dodged a gold card and the rest of I can go pretty okay to run cleanse because you can dodge that for you can dodge come deal with it as well as the old lady here that goes on targetable so if you are trying to look through Camille it is indeed that and we're going to get that gal you made that we expect it out of the month as a result once again they're going to be looking to have him support those two side land someday FBI the big carries hear from is actually a pretty good Pick 4 for trying to shut down you'll popping up the wall being able to place of space as well with your ultimate to work with Misfortune but it might be here does put even more problems into piloting the jacks orLeon because both you can get out there to Rome and with his own ultimate can have a long-range plays to set up for these glasses in the Pittsburgh Twisted Fate 590 going very pick heavy this time around they are giving up a decent amount of what they have invested in early on in this series in all of the support of pics with Moonstone or neutered feeling you up they want to get picked and they want to get kills with them I just chimed in real quick cuz they're on TV are not swapping so we thought it was going to be who he playing is tried-and-true set support it is set in mid for the mate the galio goes down to Ubi I love the flexibility because you look at me like that but they're going the other way around here it's going to be fun to watch to see how that one plays how could certainly fat kittens with Santi of pressure pretty well the Legend So High in Tiffin truly poke you out of Lane and garlic is going to make the plays in The End Zone people out as well so I should be a very fun to watch for yeah and it it doesn't mean it is going to be a little bit difficult on bottomI facing a Bard MF Lane early on we'll see how much pressure they can actually retain in Lane this might change how they try and set up you know for the early stages for this River control around dragon and if you're actually going to be sending so much attention to the Jacks Camille matchup do you want to finish screen right now game 4 is about to begin with right now going to be exciting battle between these two giant teams in the LCS and lock in coming to a close this weekend the 1st of my finals when are watching right now people knew how did things versus Cloud9 was probably be closer of the two semifinal and Christine I finally got themselves a win in game 3 we're hoping the game for it to be Justice clothes I do not believe how do these was spotted on the way but now it's been will be seeing goes for the Monte he will eventually catch the van I think even despite the W will get a range for the pull back and I'm not quite so good job has been holding on to a skill point wi was take a while to ramp up gets out of range and time and no harm no foul funny cuz it is plenty of Steel yourself at thumbs up from both sides of course you know ghost as a very local down so you often see your people popping their ghosts in these level ones because you have so much exit I'm still for a 4 meeting to come to Lane probably won't be taken advantage of in the slightest but it did give the window for that Ward over on Blue buff that fight was able to get a little bit deeper and work so they know when is the percent for sure closer starting spot on red and can't see the transitional. As well so pretty normal leasing on both sides close to going for somewhat of a full clear here at the Red Bluff going to not burn Smita this one probably on the crugs is the Autos knock that one down dueling show up it's pretty much full information and you wouldn't go to Lane late just a fake delete it's not really worth that so we know where the counter strike is going to block the grasp of the undying trigger and said they would still rather Auto one extra time but look at that good place Live Oak in had a couple of Health packs down there already knew topping is volatile wanted to give him help over to fudge to make that late a little bit nicer than nice play right there yeah and he's also pushing because you know that you have bottom style side start to Leah so he can transition up to the top side to make sure you don't get your picked off early on punished for this pushing and again it's it's the stages before level 6 where Camille can you actually gain control a it's Jack's if you're if you're able to W at work around The Counter Strike opportunities but it gets really really difficult with a brute force that Jack gets when he gets at level six extra passive damage as well as being a little talk to your ultimate after The Counter Strike so that even after the short trade you have a lot of answers for the long trade to judge anybody gone for the fact that he's only took the single potion has a house party lead in a stocking crafts with the S Telegraph me so late. Too bad for him some paper to check through all three Graphics tax though and now here comes apart because the lady has turned around Sunday burn his health pool to get the wave pushed into that it would fail to meet bladder has to be this out of that because he's already swept from the ward in try Rush he's playing for Scuttle crab and there is no dive now onto fudgy cannot be gank they know the time goes around bladder past pretty successfully to get tough schedule coming off even more of closes options yes indeed jewelry colored on the bottom side now it's going to be that more waiting. A little bit less aggressive from Sunday that we're looking for towards level six to spike it right back up closer than all the way back down to bottom side knowing with that black purple priority on the top camp with the push and Camille plus the quicker clear for himself is Rick always seem so you have a timing there and you can a factor in 40 seconds into him being right back on the map Italy is actually a little bit faster because of the passive but that's General Your Mark early game before people upgrade to their two tier two boots boots picked up as well of course yeah the one nice thing to also keep in mind as we're kind of tracking closer a spectator the cloud has tracking them as players if they also know they started bottom side then later they literally see the lease but they could you know track that from The Outfield across the game shorter Cole and Savannah smell burnt toast as well but the knowledge was there that okay indeed closer is about size start he's going to be on crutches going to go over that the Raptors and bladder order Little Five Night be here for a bit of a play as a person Vulcan are here to make it as long as he's safe to get to shut the wave out and that should before you like it should read that I think to Captain will not break that being freeze things that who he does because he's been so good in Gage's later on that play right there was made because he goes for a timing that you don't expect both bottom line supports recalling but he skipped his base immediately up Fords Midland instead of going for the base first so it's a decent timing on the support topside though can't going off of slow at least but just going to be true of War going to find this done the Dodge. he almost drop someday nearly had a margin but it's not going to happen here comes a fly from Detroit getting away is who he and spent do I grill pulled no harm no foul to lose weight though. They got a little pressure off Einstein with the extra showing on top but man that killed was so close someday had successfully escaped but wanted to finish off that one with his died inside Tower range that is calculated no problem Odyssey. Pretty pretty comical event as as he has set himself up someday you play The Escape really well you know that that's the way to go and then he turns around looking for the final turn around and kill why we're going to sustain off of the extra potion as well doesn't quite get it couple extra damage there but it is it is going to significantly change he had been doing so well early on with the Jacks part of it pushing in a little heavily on fudge and retaining what we seen for most of the series where he's had the upper hand nice little bit of relief provided by bladder even if it was risking close end of the day it's still an XP and gold bleed for Sunday the 20s is more than enough to make up for the lack wave 200 gold and here comes the squad closer and who here there but don't worry focus there as well with a twist of fate of the top it's going to push back the second one comes across and it's still a great like to do on 459 big support plays for a good bulking heads over so quickly with The Bard and chance to laugh when we're talking about affecting the topside match up his transitional period here with Bart's so quick to cross the map with the ultimate from Twisted Fate again Cloud 9 are investing more into topside more into fudge more into an area of the map that they have had as a weakness for most of the series and it's been good and yes the top one is still going you know Sunday favorite events that they both got to kill their Sunday still up in farm but Cloud 9 are there to answer every time volkans already here TSN trade for the old me to get so high trapeze date whenever you see them build up a to Stacked wave like this you have to think or at least have some answers in place to deal with the dive and this time around Cloud 9 in mediately close the Trap you mention it Twisted Fate Vulcan immediately there it's still it's pretty closing and start to see somebody try to fight his way out of it they still get a kill four hundred thieves someday does get some of the gold there so I guess what you pass level 6 now level 7 with the extra see isolated and got the
so I did both of these teams to take band last week a little bit deeper and it's very clear the values that you look what showed in week one day bad grades every single time in their first rotation and another one of the Str8 Aries do that then they could first fix the trundle and a fil F Elio's combination for Rockside tactical building a very strong 45 and in there for 2 game 13 cops were almost identical and a claim that are Oriana feel the same role of jelly is 12 times as well and the only real change was in the support picked in Corte De putear if there'll accent is going to be the grave and they want to continue putting Proctor on the trundle having it five on five subject to focus I know that Proctor has been very outspoken and streams an interview that he wants to play more aggressiveand he wants to fight more and have more play making some able to see that variation here in week number two because it leads number one very clearly Team Liquid had the same game plan he was proposed for sure well one gameplay we're not going to see different today is full of their bad right off the bat course we are on top 10 point Have Some Day or B is for the champion of the lowest win rates at least the Top Lane a lot now but won't be played at all in this game now with Grace. Fan I would expect him to pick this up to him instead of the trundle because the fourth phase Rush Graves had so much extra priority over the sun do do I taken at Keystone now or you can just basically run around my nose fillers not even care about it at all of this give me that my big gripe when I wastalking about a hundred thieves Champion Select last week do they put some day on the orange twice and someday hovers that there as a little shout-out to their last weekend so. Position of a hundred thieves using Hanks Tom day whereas he is actually their best player and a lot of people after I do to start I don't want to see him on more of a carry for you to 10 p.m. what will the eclipse affect the South Lane we haven't seen Cody sento the champion yet but was a sample of two games doesn't mean he doesn't play the champion obviously I want to be part of these will wait and see if they will know we are luchando en Orden said go grab jungle bed or coming somewhere like that video speeds blast and seconds to figure out what else to play and they are going to pick support the brush Calista likely very strong huion can have a lot of pressure here if it splits so far as the door open for the solo length Alyssa and it's likely the top linkdefinitely could go into the hand of someday we'll definitely wait on that one as the as real as soon as the most likely here for for tax bill with billiards in the variable speed band out combined with this because they do need some form of Assisi set up here and they've already seen the stress on the other side 400 leave so they know these leaked Duo down there may be a little bit more safety for the for the bottom Wing corn if you want crawfish hole in your line of right now unless you really want to see if some difficult for you if you from the jungle talk to be pretty comfortable there twisted handle lock it and it's going to be all around the map I really love the influx of switch replaced by that we've seen around the world people has been going all the a piece with the face I create so much extra opportunity and possibilities when we're living in a meta that really thrives withJurassic jungle it's an aggressive jungler or Team Liquid backed up by Twisted Fate ultimate so much more in vapor pressure and removes one of the barriers of having to get your mid laner roaming early having to shovel early and walk with the jugular now to take you to join them when something pasta already well it's going to be locked in for the second game in a row here for Wyoming to be on another late-game high damage made leader of the LCS up alongside videos that you have both been doing a whole lot of running forward and getting picked off when doing so where am I also tend to do a lot more damage last night and hasn't had those good games under him GIF be at the threats port-a-cath about is equals before so in my mind looking for those to the step up and on his ear nobody else, he can find his way in no way some more the engage tools that cord gauge avard was so good lap table here I'm expecting the other band from Team Liquid to seeing Italy as well one of the other Champions I can do pretty well is the graves. Both of them are very quickly and it becomes can't understand off when they meet early and nobody really have to commit to it definitely think of him more as the Olaf to mail a style Champions player though so let's do jungle on for right here and save the counter pick for someday this feels like a big pain from Week 1 to week to that hunts answers trying to pull in draft where I was before they are just clapping down in early orange say okay we're going to try and have a standard p55 on5 somebody just join the rest of the team but this time around it looks like they really want a cap to fix they're going to force Team Liquid to show their paw play first there's a male a kind of FEMA talking about four yeah it'll stay bad out the trundle for the team fight present for a blind orange like you were looking for a bit earlier in the draft one of those tanks they don't want to get shredded by the old that you thought as well Braves stats off of nose peeling away from Aftershock torn or strained Nautilus or an orange after they got you very likely in the strap by the way I'll walk with you by Linkin Pharmacy what he can do in the early jungle but they got to be pretty explosive jungle temp outside here so now to yell yes there was the blind orange Plaza right you know Clifton might be up there and now he's worth of quarters honestly with it I want to see some day with a with a caterpillar on the top side that can actually like when you use a game we seen a couple of tests are team sport successful and unsuccessful across the world in 58 KL into the orange and having the easier ramp up time to get your identity with a nice little couch or hear thrown in at the end from Team Liquid according to J obviously you can go for the Quaker hooks onto the threat Assessments in CST stand for a little bit locks himself in place and blitzcrank definitely can pull him over try and get that kill his a truck certainly very strong one B5 and gone last split this feels a little bit more like a spring split hunted these Braff for Sunday can take the game it was own hands I'm curious to know how much they can play around Braves Albie's he can be a very very scary jungler can get some pressure done but if somebody holds e u probably get away from everything and on the bottom side to I'm always looking at where's the specificity call early because Steve Birds 2 ultimates from Twisted Fate are very critical in the ramp of time of his composition if you're looking on the bottom side you need to do it very quickly, later is now with the beard changes have a little bit of an extra lead on bottom Lane experience or Jensen will hit that level six far above the kalista and thresh where they get so much safety down in that bottom line and it becomes much more difficult even with a Twisted Fate fate to try and force that so I'll be really looking at that time in closely for Jensen if you can gain some room at that level 6 bike size on the Twisted Fate is that goes down and going to be the one I'm looking for the most here because Haiti has been exposed to it's been a fun Champion love watching a plate especially in Pro and seeing our egos right it is the most scherff by our way of telling you what this game is about when he shows up in that lane like this is the layer trying to get this but we're kind of forced down as we're going to get 600 let's go atrax I left a mess they have a dream scenario and dragon is down and they want to go for Richfield afterwards you can get an objective that way you have jungle pressure up there but it is going to be very likely that you try and combined with blitzcrank blitzcrank of Twisted Fate match made in heaven those are the types of plays that we like to see it the combination of some of the synergies hear a whole lot of friends near him as one of the big questions around STL line of course this is why you're right over there at your like eight inches away on the monitor so we're practically adjacent we're not quite Holdings was just messing up based on the pixel density here but regardless the point is that it's okay but can't hold up Twitter doublelift it certainly Wendover underperforming TL as a whole Squad didn't do very well in the spring split so okay but you had won four titles in a row with this guy tackles in can you fill those shoes at all so far guess he's been very very good A lot of that isn't he's been very very well supported and hasn't had to do many difficult things right is pay Farm really well you know Auto attack directly in a Teen Titans multi-volume check but otherwise it's kind of laid out for him right where it where the team flights are pretty well orchestrated the blood-soaked except for the grace coming down as well as I feel pretty confident that TL get a lot of pressure in front of tactical and as far as tactical goes I I feel like we already are moving the moving past him living in double with Shadow and are moving past knew everyone constantly having these comparisons because he is really building his career in his own right or 6 play now I believe you know working really well in with this team liquid roster that has all these super experienced players and I'm super excited to see how they continue to build on that especially him and core JJ specifically doing so much and having so much time invested in them as partners uphill battle so far a 0-2 start to the split but of course they can still pick up with lots more games to play this kind of unlucky all of their game so far have been against undefeated teams it's been a really difficult strength-of-schedule 100 thieves and I think that sells them a bit short I think they are still a solid team but there again some of the very best squads they could face right now and it's it's I think giving a bad eye test when they're better than they look for sure they had in my opinion the most difficult starting schedule for week 1 Cloud 9 and EG like you said two undefeated teams two of the best teams black Square as well so they really started out with some tough competition definitely had a lot of mistakes themselves to clean up regardless and I think that now is definitely a time or they can show that Improvement who seems liquid here did come out with the two of them selves so how's your thieves continue their schedule of going against undefeated teams whenever you have a blitzcrank of course everybody is very wary of the level ones so some defensive Wars come out in the pixel brushed and they do get side on court AJ yep no big deal and we wait to see what something special going on looks like know it's going to cool off already there ferns the cleanse look back in for some damn it for Rio massive deal with that already some of your talk about in champ select two shows up on screen one minute into the gave year really short cool down so sometimes that's hard to really take advantage of wine that Summoner but they got a decent almost 200 damage as well so pretty through the health potion already for the first one for Ryoma sets up a little bit easier of a time to take control of that mid-wave and again we're going to keep our eyes on tracking Jensen and his progress towards that level 6 to try and make the big Play Someday goes for the piece of trade on impact who Dodges two out of three Sweet Spot Ali walk without any proper told again right there ghosts in is now running no longer has the ramp up time on to it you get quick right away longer cool down but it extends the duration if you get a killer in a fight so might seem to have been around for a really long time changes in the game that was most critical for Mid laners because midlanders always used to use ghost as the instant Dodge button and Jensen is a guy who was always applauded for his ability to dodge gangster Dodge skill-shot so now that goes has that instant speed you're talking about doesn't have to wait on the ramp of time I'm looking for Jensen to know what is Flash in a lot of scenarios just use the ghost and go for the side steps can be one that's a little bit difficult to sidestep but again sometimes you can see people moving forward into it and trying to outplay that way so you can get the gold star counter initiation so a lot of options for him still videos of God they were as boxer went down bottom and got a little bit more safety here for tactical and chords of Jay do you want to point out via kind of comparison Point here as we looked at things go down
some jungles are only words I know. I talked on his exit with tsmp the interview where he said that he was being kind of horse Klay play style he didn't agree with and it's really unfortunate that it continues to happen where it seems like TSM when I had them but speak his back and for what I heard they want to play with them that they think he has a bad showing and then he proved is going to be here I don't think that you can expect csm's birthday who represented with their level throughout the entire year of the last time the Boston beer can work in Duffield running a lot of chippy chips together yes that was a couple years ago, double is also in a winning on slot on Team Liquid so there are high expectations now that they are reunited again your auntie at them and we will see you know can they actually met as a squad and develop as they need to I do think one of the big concerns 40 at them though is is how Gordon the jungle roll it right nowand you have a completely unproven jongleur in Topeka right you know people people are talking about jungles the most powerful role in the game right now and we've been seeing go very clearly in some of these other games you look at innocent parents games look up flowers games are they are running over the competition you can get to a situation where the game is completely revolving around this Tumblr an invasive these sorts of plates do you need to have a concert to have a jungle performing at a very high level in that puts an incredible amount of pressure on Beka especially on TSM where there's already so much attention on that jungle rollers you say they always talk about Vietnam Jungle Earth revolving door there it's like the defense against dark arts teacher of League of Legends Britney's is always a discussion about them being made into word of this defensive player so because battling cuz all of that without really having much competitive experienceabsolutely nothing you need a player I've had like 50 in a jungle are like blabber who gets hotter than takes the entire waving inflatable recalling a zit popping is recalling friends again don't worry I'll I'll take as good as 50 gold and it's alright it's going to head be the force to change things around in its rewards right now supposed to be in Z being played and and even though it's the gates of rain where you know late-game farming is more important than kind of are a bigger factor in your team fights than before things I was going to lock in at set for themselves labor I can do for you on that one but we know can also Flex the jungle in sportDefine possible I wouldn't think it would be the Port Perry the Azrael those two deals, convery off the ends of the spectrum so now I'm expecting it to be going up to Viper we have been seeing a lot of set jungle lately and yes could you schedule. Alongside that Azrael Azrael Lulu all these sorts of tuna poke Lane of people are feeling or are working pretty well and if people have kind of I think I'm more comfortable playing those and Cancers and to a level where they're not feeling like there's going to get gang to die because that was always been as both the logic for playing tank oh no you can't be going up against EMF to me that is a very very strong bottom leaves does have the ability to really going to poke you out and then one that lane so I do think that could be as real Lulu bought late is going to be on the back foot early on here pretty heavily unless they can reallyLanding a lot of those music shops yeah I definitely agree I'm going to see if inside and left again Johnson after really do Lansing good poke in and even know just hope is not enough TV off deals that are easily so I'm expected you to look good on the bottom side so especially with the pedigree players like it wasn't biofrost I'm going to go pretty favorites in general I like to undo a whole lot in the jungle with the great band to be very easy. And feel good about you seem to lead them dancing through 12 are wisdom or Jungle Band inside you can actually be easier if you just hop right over the pillar and sometimes even take to get to the Trumbull as a result of that is if there's not really a lot of staff to actually steal from that can drive out those Marksman junglers can be very very difficult for the troll there are still stuff like Olaf if you can go with us but you know can be pretty rough when you're older than youcan you get focused down there are AP junglers things like ragus at least that he could go towards so I have to be exactly where Katie want to take us but you know with that with as real they do have the ability to go to work clothes at a beach with previously all right well at least I could be locked in your the Top Lane as the expected matchups into that set upstairs yes flexibility between set and it before but nine times out of 10 is it from toppling for Viper and broken blade back on the h-r octave lose two games in a row for him to try to win that sort of match that there's the Olaf hover definitely no high-priced Champion Acadian though they get about other apothecaries and not only did as imaginative lineup switch does not have a lot of right now but if they have that big beige and is going to be here in Italy you know what I was kind of expecting a p jungler this is obviously another option is there a newly also very strong I think in this current Meadow power farming jungler again you don't want to just be power for me you are side of map you want him getting in your opponent state power farming dare jungle to Italy has one of the fastest cleared of any Jumper in the game and does have the ability to always be able to get in and out of their phone would you like me to count jumping over the dragon ball dropping jumping over the Ritz-Carlton Bal to move in and out of these situations birchrunville can't really fracker don't get the Katy can get rolling you could really see him look at this dude have you been to the one B-12 should have you been to the clear to be not going to be such a lot of Reliance on him to kind of get things done TSM underscore key for their last picture with mid-length much more of a can of splode healing style of Pixar we have to be for Keith new workout very very well with you via that combo just do Jay and Diesel kind of gathered up in their first game to really really look good there in hundred music I do believe that was so that's a situation where we could see to get them looking kind of utilizes imfdb download to get ahead and bottom layer Leon then see Bob Ross moving and really kind of gathering up with your sin to utilize that combo for going towards Bleecker and Mystics game looks pretty good overall got a good will write a set of Champions if you do he'll want to stuff I feel like a monster and come with us to Asian wedding there, looks pretty good overall as well although it's hurting my eyes are on what they can do because that is no she's not actually very uncommon in the Summers limit of game around the world she still is very high variance Champion if you don't have to go to the provide very much is almost purely a damaged champ Majors like grits or Carthage that used to be popular AP junglers like well even if your behind on gragas you still got all the Predator games for the early game you still got the voice of Casper big stuff and I need to get one shot at least friends on Uno defile the Wild Wild n Out there or at least can be very feast or famine and into you know I like to know as a player and I want to see how that plays out on your side right it's because I'm trundle it is very hard to screw up on trundle even you are behind the Ulta tank you know I guess the opposing set and in this case you take some stuff back in after them pretty reasonable Throwdown pillar you all someone you're doing okay right you know you can also going to build and support itemization at the one caveat I will go is that you can do Builds on newly like Iruna cat goes into an athene's and you can actually do kind of more of a support of style of build your they do obviously have a lot of shielding already with the Lulu and the Oriana so if you're as real as having a really good game where you can be spamming heels with your things as Natalie on his asriel's giving a taxi there he's getting double shielded from this movie Warrior on a combo and all of a sudden he has Roku become so damn hard to actually knocked down it's already a very difficult Champion to deal with that time that being said it's real not really that kind of trishul hyper stealing Champion that you really think of having all these passports in the pocket of I will have to see you I think a pretty damn good came out of Jonathan that's a really make this work yeah we had a ton of bands right clothes and family hosts were gone up to that right away the nearest as well soap yeah it's real heavy fries with you right now what is hyper carry Champion that you typically see all the buses go onto so have to wait to see what comes out of that one still can't do very well as you mention John has a good game he's worth supporting has been a decent player overall and it's going to be the pretty standards Red game start here sweepers for both the junglers but no Wards killed you're going to see that despite sweet being used Acadias get anything out of it he was looking up for that top side for a pixel brush Ward perhaps not able to find sorry I should I should fix what I said I believe you bought a war drop the whole freaking switched over and deal with 10 gold you get the 10 go through sweeping what smells last hit it come on man it's a really minor thing but it's objectively wrong maybe didn't even mean to Uno's but either way we will see how he can be able to go from here and you're right of course before the board then swapping the sweeper also worth noting that problem is actually playing FaZe rugs which I always love thee against rental in particular Final Four score he is not exactly the most depressing of the game combos they're very light on that pillar and the pillars slow and when you can profit is Russian all these you get to move speed increased a lot of people sometimes forget about know that the slow resistance right so you know it's going to make it so you can just easily walk out of a lot of those games unless you get completely burst out there just going to get the reliable golden Broken Blade right help kill the board with level 2 on the first wave goes in right away by hurricane ever fight back finally. Have some more abilities learned up but that is a very very good for a straight pipe organ or line is passive health regen of the doors blade not going to make a potion of a broken blade going for another big trade right. Good enough for him just text her name is a shin a little bit because that ain't I have to have something people kind of apple why are they going this right you know why it said how do you know which one to buy an end the way I look at it is kind of similar to situations requiring would have been good before where does more defensive if he's either too risky to do for you cannot consistently get that coke off to keep your selfies on cool down the whole time to go generation just isn't worthwhile right see you then want to go for the relics you know that they're still situations where they'll be some very very good again slower Rhett smillie supports for example of things like drama and very easy to actually bought that fact that Tom kench going to go for it but skip it was Heavy engage or that it is hard to get that poke off again like the fresh like the Nautilus or if it's better to just go Raleigh Shelton back up that gold medals so far to the early game as we look around the jungle and whatnot Topeka and Acadian tide in the camps clear does Acadian runs over the top and side and Look to You by the most common trundles near path by the way is do your entire jungle - Scruggs and then show up and fight for Scott on how to get to level four and usually when you're only one that's most of the Champions cuz it's that feeling 24-hour jungle CS overall is frogs are up but it looks like beer actually being up Farm on the nidalee is it out really good situation for the struggles that look like you're trying to go if you're on the top side whilst sphere but nothing's happening I side step by step the wind and the wave Loop 202 be as well as most of the way then he wants to recall there's the rest of it and hate you dang they built from the potion to CS count to be pretty blue cross tattoo of woman by forgets first three calls or even a broken plate laning looks really good he's ahead in this Lane exactly did the training doesn't really matter if you know unless you can get something from it in a winning trades is only good if you see a bit of that steep rock rock band Rush to get out the Flash's Bells run he was down just by poking Bjergsen and the day that a seminar down and and its calf Rocklin forced to recall a time that maybe you didn't want to go for lunch I'll do you say wedding in faith in everything becomes vignette it's by a doran's ring of buying apps home by some consumables and yeah he's about 300 short of getting you know the first big house like if you wanted to be does prioritize them the double door and was dead, just the pieces of that lost chapter you know clearly wanting the most power now still feeling like this before so that you can see if he's going to be going for this year built hear something kind of similar to when you see a drill just grab keys at four this year news actually just grabbing pickaxe power know my God by Pearl Jam lead he was level 5 broken plate haven't bought any items the damaged just wasn't there off to the tower dive in it completely blows up in his face he does not uses w there like he had a life I'm not sure if it was still on cooldown but 21 Auto auto write it just like okay I'm going to call you in a minute twice twice then W and poops too much damage do so much damage early on especially when you haven't bought any hbr armor you are going to get absolutely roasted by those turrets and that's a big mistake honestly from Viper to die like that without fee fee you do can be pretty rough situation thank you for him at least he did have to waive shove out who will be able to get back in time and actually collected in a little bit of class you're onto a gabion could be trouble that will not go away and there's a Shockwave forcing speaker to get out still got a point us because gup to flashes for one face this game so far acadians on the chase can't land the chat without the eggs are still good give me away from that one
and I he didn't do something damn it back then and we just got. One deposit thing again R1 and oseph on the LCS picking up where they left off as what seems to be the most dominant team in the league has had a rough start against a very solid Evil Geniuses they have a rootle schedule with how well EG played in the first couple of guineas that is obviously a pretty tough team to go up against them to have Cloud 9 as your follow-up game is that things could get worse easy going for but you want to see if they can really compete with these Topsy's deal can they hold their own against Cloud 9 no make it at least competitive I am really looking at that Top Lane Dallas have to talk about a lot somebody really had an incredible string split regular season and playoffs did not match up well in those playoff series do you know I want to see what time they can bring beer on the right side will they prioritize him a little bit more than yesterday because yesterday he was Snowblind picking Warren I would love to teach them date get an advantageous match up against Liquor Agency can you win through your toppling can you have the Superstar top laners dumdei try to take over the game a little bit when I'm back back Olaf game Deer for bladder has been a super highly prized top to jungaleers upload videos played yesterday or I should say on Saturday no Friday there we go through as well be happening worldwide most picked top laner as the end of the LPL have any more games on Wukong to do on Oren but they're going to lock up their Cody sun on the mic I think he's been one of their best board members in the game so far and some days feel like the lake insurance and asriel you lie already locked the Cloud 9 feels like without her teeth are more willing to use someday as as this one picks and they are willing to pick for him it's one of those situations where it feels like they're saying okay if you're good enough to win or or be okay and ever knocked up maybe some of the other players aren't but then it becomes this is just got to know should you emphasize strength or sure up weaknesses and it feels like they're using somebody to show up the weakness of of Rio Alma who does often struggle in this Lane and you don't have been having as good of a time but then you know your kind of taking away one of your major wind conditions which is something that I dropped off about how hundred thieves draft because I just think that somebody stuck a talented me later if you get them winning matches as he showed in Spring that can just win you the whole game right and now you're taking that completely away and you're putting him in a situation where you know it's not going to slam Licorice and then you're relying now on on Wyoming and Cody them very heavily and in those guys I think are not matching up as well perhaps some day is nice outside and I was going to take the Devil's Advocate side of this one which is hey maybe it's none of these trying to flush us wrestling team thing looked yet summer split this is the one that this is Two Worlds were going to do well as do that but we've got 9 week and playoffs to like be in that form let's find ways to go about them they won binibining through that lens I fully accept him if he's putting something out of Ryoma and mediocre the rest of that Squad to be ready because if that is your goal that I think that makes complete logical been to play that way so I still look grief if I'm trying to win a game right now it's like hey was it banned let's get some Alabama championship Def Leppard had last time around it is. Previous game he was actually playing you know that pull off and keep your can actually fair I pretty well know since he was going to give consent or at least in some different games but they're pretty well against the law that you have to be very careful of face checking if you were the one getting the jump on Olaf and you can use your view of the dance of arrows to actually Dodge out the old off of Acts that becomes a woman that you can actually win early on if that's if you do have red spots but if you are Fey checking that all off and hit that for a fact you are going to be doomed though I will see how many videos can play this year we have to be careful to make sure he knows where Olaf is and a Time fix down Gangplank is hovering cloud like a lock that one in so hey we're getting a fighter up their shot at the Jazz last rational game on their butt looks like DP coppin against orange to be an exciting one that would be whole bunch of fun if you were by the way up right on the the Kindred Olaf what it was just that match up as opposed to expense Karen so media is playing the reverse matchup that he played up on Friday and as you mentioned blabber getting his second Olaf games straight as it's going to be the rest of the squad The Incredibles but Galley open follow up on it but easy that you often struggle to find Opportunities to really use that well so well with hard engage things like like the not Afflicted Jarvan you know even the work on canvas that are guaranteed go but what are your go button is to Zoloft pressing ultimate and running towards his opponent that you're hoping that that is going to give you that perfectly Oh Holy Night I struggle to see that happening so I do think that cloud 9 actually doesn't have the best draft hear that being said you can use it as counter gauge and one thing I do have to point out is that Kelly was incredibly good and Dequindre. So what you can actually do with when the kids are dropped the ultimate you then time your ultimate to land as the Kindred ultimate is expiring you have the time to come out of that and it pretty much guarantees a team fight win if you can get that combo time perfectly that being said to use ear is also there to shuffle people out of the country so it's really going to depend on those interactions and who can use that best if it does come down as he fights what for though it's it's it's hey it's about new presents they ever look at the Circle get ready for the crock of the Comedown it's going to be explosive in 3 2 1 and 1/4 Hilton both sides for I'm glad you went to the counter gauge side because that that is what it feels like sand I have to do here is what I've got the Azrael UV poke they clearly pick for a toppling counterpick write R in the metagame special North America were you expecting early or and so so getting cops around what we're going to play Gangplank in the second round draft and then we're going to play around Side Lane in the rest of our team is waived there and cut her and gave you that is at least a look that scene and can show us and yeah I want to know if it works well because on the opposing side azir Kindred afelius right there is some very very good back light damage amount of these side it feels like to me is that scene is actually drafting tools go for man bought over and over I think that they're going to use this you me as real to poke out the bottom Lane 30 use the Olaf to push mid with this galio to get priority there and then they're going to do it four-bedroom down to buy side Olaf runs into try to dive this for a galley assaulting on top of them you have is really knew me for those also try to lock them down and I think you may see Gangplank just farming up in that Top Lane Alton bought on cool and I think that is going to be the game plan so we'll see if hundred thieves can identify that and react to it sometimes it's a lot easier said than done to answer any C9 aggressive plays because they are so consistent about them there so quick to pull the trigger on those moves and you've got to be matching them you'll punch for punch blow for blow the entire game long or seen I was running over I'm always intrigued position that that's how far of a game plan then just hears what are five on five looks like well we got to engage we put before him to know that the cop is around the first 15 minutes where where does never out of Bot Lane 12 CS at 12 minutes and well better botwin's goes for me too in this Lane like a sort of second level you're doing things that aren't as standard in your generically compositions and I mean you can even see the inside of 4 niskey is is working more towards us as well you take the minion dematerializer you can dematerialize Canon waves instantly wave pure out the rest of that with your QE put Paso if you know a wee Auto and then guess what your roaming it is yours that is stuck having to either give up to it that way to match the room or his going to be behind on that room so that is something that is a really intelligent way to set up if you're looking for the sort of played Paladin here we go a blabber starting off with the sweeper and notice how he actually donate to CS over to licorice if you give that one word kill to a Solunar they will actually get that level to one minion sooner and we have can actually made it matter why is a real trouble he walked into what I believe was XP Ranger as well and that should mean that both of them should be getting a little TV off of just the first wave give me the Lawton stop playing that thing is so volatile down there is the lanes show up perfect csgo far for these best he can as well bladder expand the power Farm duties blue start machete Chucky Down single soccer camps no problem with Zoloft cats singing We have seen a couple different looks so far in a blabber obviously yesterday A lot of it was, stating about getting really aggressive trying to steal away camps consoling with this olafe y'all so did go for a fairly impressive field yesterday with the warrior we've been seeing mostly Warrior thus far this season where it can in the past but he left it to me hasn't seen a lot more kind of tank Aloft they do have quite a bit of Michigan is going to be interesting to see if he wants to go for that full damage style I just kind of pair up with that Union and fly in there and try to knock people down early and a very small early CS Lidl Icarus was something smells a little bit of blood flow licorice better be careful the punch comes in a Flash would kill him and that means Liquors has to flash a way about Sunday's wouldn't let against the counter picker Leon is liquor a step too far up Dad me that's always the danger of Warren into these melee matchups is that yes this is a match up where I do scaling in QP that you can really come to the farm at Lake game but the bridge Proxes do so much damage and now that the wave hasn't been able to be pushed in Italy purse was looking to try to shove that way I wasn't able to get it in is down Flash and now he's in this really expose spot where he backs off the wave is frozen if he doesn't get exposed to a gang cat videos up here so I think licorice is probably going to die without that why don't you hate that I'm here comes with low not to leave this one has yet but easy pick up their first Blood the hundred thieves media starts up Sunday for really well played in the back of the fridge what goes okay laughter flash they're not too bad but the fact that first wife goes to war makes it even harder and guess what he doesn't even get to just walk back too late he's got a TV because a way to still screwed the wave is still frozen up there so we need to get this into the turret and this is one of those situations where the one mistake early on from licorice starts to Snowball the fact that he miss played those are really crazy at the flash me if he still needs to stay around unfreeze the wave me tell pork and Concerta kind of snowball these these errors into a difficult situation so good punished by someday and videos then I will see how licorice Kendrick up I'm going to do is very best managed to push the way the rest of the way in we saw blabber was able to take the top River they actually kind of site Safety Dance finish of course I didn't recall making teleport back alright so flash advantage of to All Things Considered but it seems that can be another dank Target the other part of that that you know I have to address also is the fact that while he is a thing that time Yankee charge straight to take that away from somebody else didn't get a mark from either of those good old is going to be behind in farm and then it came to the situation where you know if you try to regain can do lots of Darren Olaf is just way stronger than that Kendra your Olaf can just completely change that fight out though that can be pretty rough and you can see somebody actually use this TV but it's taking the bad end of a couple streets immediately after so Gangplank is service hearing himself back in this Lane someday in a free low a man that behind on health if you get hit by too many of those Gangplank use with grass but are you are going to get stomped out as and really start to lose control in that area well right now the media is going to go back to the bottom of the map and what's Dundas and Cody Sun finishing their recent recalls and it didn't come in early times beef Elliott's goes berserk Grieves over the more space if you can get it be up for a recall but ask the extra for down there was a very very early pick up under these it was more of a window of opportunity you're playing at the TPS real so you need to take those recalls as a value of the things when you end up looking for the all-in will you broke the first and I'll be easy punch knuckles for the floor doesn't it licorice I don't know if that was a misclick are we meant to go for that one but liquor is now feels comfortable to hit back at Sunday is out of cool down some health back up there's a bit of it look like a cancelled Auto you know we did have it riddle crock not sure that that went as well as he was hoping licorice also still has the ultimate so someday be a bit of an awkward spot but I think it was just kind of a window of opportunity for a belly has to take that reset you getting that early dragon is great especially when Kindred is the one behind the face of the Olaf we saw yesterday about 9 it was kind of having this this back-and-forth game with life was and the reason they really started to actually take over was the objectives why they got themselves so they got themselves Elder they took all the original Dublin so deny that stacking condition was great was the flat back over the wall axe going to land solo and cannon mirage red licorice to kill against the opposing jungle alert Isaac like right back up is there a purchase it there's no escaping for something he has no TP it's 3 minutes hop is yours mid the junk was dead they know there's no way out there so they just need to do it cleanly pulling aggro here early flag can I get rid of the top of the NACA to spill verithin easy walk away Nikki has no problem making that died vaping flower going to leave some gold
Wishing by Edo can work out a price on that team like he's supposed to call play that he loves playing with their back together I mean CSM height to be very real but this is still binds to the very best teams in the week good game that I'm excited about some slight today Yeah by itself so are so many of you know of the older fans that have a lot of nostalgia and it have all those associations with the relationship that he talks about for all the players let's jump right into that though I mentioned the Calista Calista still has not found her way onto the band face Tavares is probably going to be Perma banned in my opinion should not get through because there's just way too strongright now and we go for one of the power pick the champion OCC ated with appearance in came over as first game even over in the ALCS so many Center plays for the sky and Amy Carey but on this team it's like a 99 to 1 flax where 99 is going to be rigged yeah yeah I would be surprised if you SS game on Sandra's it split it can happen it is worth doing but has not been typically all that gun made in his career and I think it's fine as Marketplace very good at it was very Spanaway you've got that is real that week because he's too often those are the most likely possibilities and if she wants a high price baby carried out is going to take it in the zoo this round picks right nowjust great. Glennon as well it's BSM I'll bring the Calypso it meant a lot of pressure down there that's what I'm looking for here for double with his vile were the reasons double it talk about it always enjoying playing with Ralph rottens how aggressive they can be in Lane Mac something that you really want to do when you pick up his Champion especially if you're going to stare down the barrel of what looks like the makings of a nice killing 14 liquid with both of values and I know you've got Terry scaling Frontline as well as read write what's the next ticket to be for TSM to round out the first round alright Terex going to come out alongside the callista so early priority down there and set up for a lot of sass then I got to say this is one of my most prized violin theater in the elf that they should have a good time and it's almost all teams what does court datedental office that Eric hick I like it going with a barge for harassment you can throw so much harassment Monica lista para clane's Advantage for a cellulose part is just so nice in the early stages you really do have to watch out for the Olive and another thing that goes along with you if they're picking to listen to Derek's is a lot for the team play to not just about to land because Calista gives you the play making opportunities the gold button in there and that are trying to layer his own done but also it gives you a way to make really good use of your territory, timing on the biggest difficulties with Heritage hiding. Immunity to actually have value during the teeth by enforcing your phone is to fight you and it was so cool so long way in solving that yeah definitely to be an important to watch for is the bands are coming throughyes I'm going to throw some Midland bands in to look at throwing some jungle bands be going to lose the Leeson and the Jarvan to fairly highly prized Champions Braves is gone so he wants to play a top of a farmer in little obvious go to but you look at it certainly kind of pitch to the DS to the Jungle full already with the frontal lobe the band supporting it and jungle everyone always talks about 50s and maybe even more difficult now with with adding SS another star to team on the map and with all these bands going towards speak a little bit more. You mentioned in the New Delhi I think I went to Goodwin Kendrick in my opinion is also quite couldn't do the Toronto but it just means you know I'm looking at the team I would like another front liner to go along with tarek 40th them so you know either going to be a broken plate Champion or speak of Champions we have yet to SDcramping for them stuff to your with the a deer pick up play output going to look really really nice to that got kind of there their physical match. I got the front line covered it means that the Top Lane getting really be gravy write this pump worked with the worst you can play that against blood flow through that ensures that broken Blaze not a threat or you can play when I left the group and even better and I love you lock it in the place of the National League probably not paid to do is exciting all the space yeah I got a lot of changes after the dark in toppling here and I really enjoy the lower cool down on the queue for cane because you that said ability is just so much for clearing campus also your Mobility for extra out play stuff and if we got a huge bus fare and they actually had to pull back on some of the cell fillings for Rost which is what I expect I'm about to transform into go after hitting melee Champions to get his red form Came Polly form really hard to pull off in specially if I throw play and and I did give you a lot of taking a 5 of bility but I personally go so well with no Calista are the Stations of stuff but that's the world we live in a world qualifying weed so he will always have not won a fiddle my very first Main in League of Legends so soft spot for that champion For Me jeans are there more to Kaiser in the toppling here for Team Liquid should a very good interactions and what are composition if you can hold him before the fight starts or early enough you can't give it to me and vulnerability and you saw what are most accurate are coming out of damage Champion that's going to feel really good and that pic is pretty useless yeah love trying to think intelligently about breaking compositions with mordekaiser because you get your one do you want but more importantly you break synergies of the enemy team know like that that you me grabbing one where you can make your pop her off for not letting the yolk illicit Eric work together any sort of surgery that you can break their to it really adds Extra Value to the pic in addition to it being a strong one P1 top laner yeah definitely strong overall so I feel like we've got time to fill here before we have to start the game is this week as we broadcast the games on a delay for everything it still feels like we got a very sort of obvious team fight composition here on the team liquid side tactical is set up with a ton of supporting cast members of the bot Lane it's going to get it done right because Calista Atlanta fellios but Bart outlines tarek and so is this 212 is it should have lived volatile where all the nerves to affiliate with the course of time to finally drop him from them Spartan Pro plays for the first time since he's been really released to the world they have been consistently to his early game output his early game healing is worse or the ganzfeld images lower exact same time he's been since almost forever so you know the weakness is there in the early game and Calista is is poised to defeat it but I got so excited for that pick up cuz it really does add that the extra Dynamic to this Lane and of course should be able to get off consistent harassment many times you have bought Frost Epping up as well so I'm really excited to see what what you can do with this pic and if core JJ gets off some of those really impactful bar drones one of the one of my biggest loves is what I'm at junkyard I have a Bard on my team getting some of those jungle invent help with getting the vision help with getting Midland gang soft that type of stuff even a bar just as soon as your your level six and trying to lend a tempered Vape even if fully commit to Elaine can have been a very big and real impacts and chords JJ is one of our support players that that has been highlighted over the years so many times for a lot of the other such a big twice yeah I definitely want to watch for the other side of the map right you've got you know speaker who's got I'm actually sorry he's got the cane and there was really exciting it used to be to help you only champion of the year and it was one of the people like I should want to play this one but I think it's actually a decent time to talk at length about wearing 10.8 Lake in Jungle camps are worth more experience than before and that can change player Behavior as well as Champion choices and how they play out in the game and came very good at farming because of the Q die menschen like that the cube off is the single the single biggest bot that can't have gotten in so long and it actually prompted that pull back a little nervous that they did to like we're talking about that that is always going to be true that his his farming is better now and like you're saying it's in a world where it where that is good plus if you're intelligent about getting the correct color orbs trying to get your red orbs so you can get your transformation to have your CC for your knock up with your W-2 have all this extra tankiness from the healing that you're going to get did you become a very very big factor in the team fights for your team and it's it's it's weird power Spike that not a lot of other jugglers have come when when can you have 2 transformation I kind of like how that changes the game and changes your your choices and what lanes are trying to go to as well you have a big fan of that one so yeah she's going to recap what what happens if you're saying something is very very good the typical Kane Builders three point q and then then you come back to the W so for the first 13 levels he's actually got a better cool down on cue then he would have rebuffed obviously that's all very very relevant you really look at is in those later levels though from a minute 15 on words when the drawing was about level nine and then and then put us the game these camps are worth more experience and it was a nice thing is normally about 15 minutes into the game is when the junglers really to play more around their team it's when for the baron spawns at 22 just drop they're not really fragile and easy to kill as we start going to try to knock things down that's also when you have the most incentive to gain experience because now these camps are worth more you're getting 50 more XP per clear it's a no reason Lisa Stansfield out of your budget and it's pulled some players towards well but I really want to get the crows cuz that's like 18 more XP than before and that's relevant to my interests and it's even this open some more players eyes even though the bus are till the average level 9 I seen more players in the early game being like Oh yeah efficient farming is and so that's why I really like the opening game from Cloud 9 mattress got we've got some more time here at the to talk where blabber he did play the Olaf aggressively and was able to also keep up hard farming these camps so that's why we always talk about passing and efficiently being able to plan out the your next you move all right where did the game forget that history lesson be efficient as a juggler throws time is money that's all you have to remember always be killing something or placing boards a Broken Blade bringing the Royal youth emote his old team FAQ in Turkey I love it if we made it over bringing this wagon to the LCS here has been a good top laner it is time on TV so far and then one that is is worth putting pressure on to it against white it's my business on TSM is a how often does TSM play around top mattresses around bottom side get speaking realistically to talk about opinions on vaping honestly can't do both well you can do both to a mediocre level or you can do one of those Lanes very very well and I want to see which one is going to be because both died within Broken Blade are worthy and you get a lot of jungle attention so that is a question for me it's my CSM this way does how that shakes out of course I'm Silas how well does coach jacket turn to look at around 7 and 11 and not a scoreline that a 4 time back-to-back two back-to-back Champion is supposed to get in the end result is a new head coach to do 80 karrie and tactical taking over the reins down there. Do you want Spotify have no problem talking is down we can even talk a little bit more about what generation on Cane because they've done so many little tweaks to it and it's a little bit hidden hidden Knowledge from a lot of players and so they've done a lot of little feel good things like you you think it's still sealed up this kind of extra or Generations if you haven't gone to hit a champion in a while so it ended up being a lot of players do this thing where you do the farm a bit then went to build up a little you want to go at least touch someone and usually you want to touch a male a champion because usually people are are looking for the red form and then kind of balance without go do what you need to do to keep up with your efficiency and and kind of balance that that's a little bit of an extra objective I like that immediately Yep they're battling back and forth little to go to the TSM side core JJ did go Relic Shield but end of the day the threat of Clips are kidding you mean see you know doesn't really get infinite Auto Tech the minions TSM gets the early push almost dies in the first few ways but with the red gun be sustained on a fillers is absolutely absurd the pope doesn't tend to matter that's done talking too much chords recently saved obviously has the men to put down some healing pads and a little too for the bot Lane on both sides but not much of an issue csmping would take that brush control as well I got a little harassment
bringing his skill as a mid laner for everyone has stated his skill in coaching from his briefs in with the smoke was so favorite coming into this one especially after 6. Yesterday in the current meta freeway Flex 2 jungles off and support at the moment very good Playmakers but Evil Genius has first pick for the champion and don't want to let the guilty get it on the back playing at least I could go yeah definitely a strong Champion overalls receive their ass off the bad no surprises here to EG second-place finisher from the regular season in the spring split couldn't quite go all the way up last I'll be very strong performer overall in the wait at the band Kix down and come through and I'm also very intrigued to the continued growth of Kumo here in the Top Lane he wasa picture of a couple of games on cloud nine last year at exist the couple of games that they can sell them out for the team to let you know as soon but hey come on we're going to play it right he has some good games and you know got a top three in his first Real Steel starting split Ferry G in the postseason and hope he hasn't been an All-Star by any real mean I don't want to seem to keep going up right this is his first year as a full-time starter ended it. That's a really good time for the rest of these bands closed DLC pack 6 really heavily on the bottom Lane and bangs disease was the second best 80 karrie of spring split and all of the LPS so I do like that Focus they whittled down taking out some of the biggest Lane bullies and some of the biggest early-game ones Neil Calista and Barrett both extremely strong right nowdrill are probably the next to in my power rankings to be carried and they've grown ass is Campion and of course Azrael this dude Estep incorporation into the field for the nation whose God not only his own escapes and plenty of folks to throw down with the UV but we'll have no armor from Scotland as well as the field and just becomes one of the 80 carries it's actually hard to kill in a meadow everyone's complaining about how easy it is but you got to give me over here to the Lulu hover on the EEG sides we are getting double enchanters down here in the bottomlands but also Yeah you mentioned up dance but item got buffed in the middle of spring split is itBruce Lee ABS birdly stronger Melody item for Marksman as well as melee 80 Champions bruising like face might want to pick it up for example and yeah she can you do some what's Tastefully go for lethality build if you wants to go and you're not even a definite lead over top of that one as well if you want to kill switch TV that can even have more responsibilities so yeah I always a fan of the Infiniti of Hurricane availability for the most common and bang weave no is absurdly good at putting down damage in a lake GameCube ISO definitely him a lot in late-game I went to lose Fortune which would be nice going to Trumbull here for spent staring up in the jungle. It looks really good as well so easy have a very dirty fotopigeon already ate exactly this it's already we can classify both of these games I'm suppose strategies from both teams in literally the first half of the picture because this is very clear to the inside front to back from evilyou dissed you have to have three main ingredients that you all want a team like that you have your front line so I know who can also spread the enemy front line with the ultimate and then you're in cancer to buff up descaling 80 karrie of rebellious you mentioned secret and hurricane Bill to your perfect for the five people feel deep for them to try and Dodge the initiation which come in as the usual counter to post composition as they ban out now yeah yeah it's really better talk later Lucille teeth like we didn't really have a plan with thorns Emmaus lightband real quick cuz he wasn't let it stop there yet has a 612 Sure Fire way and so I like a Storm's already gone Malachi is not the most reliable engage unexpected out of the top so I'm Not Guilty band IIshe might want to have a nice game. Some of that first the block certainly very scary because it's a protection man A lot of times info competition you yourself don't have a lot of your own targeted crowd control until you can get picked apart by something like love lost that you really do need someone to go to lock them down later or closed are able to get a lot of McKinney skate and talk to your front line and we're going to ride it out with the galio there for the last one they don't want the extra protection from that cross map ultimate to come inall this would be what would expect to see me for more poke as yes indeed Lily comes through for Wiggly did get buff do patches go more Joplin top damaged the lake steamed hams Alta worth more experience about 15 into the game on words to spawn a power Farm a later on the game and remains a high-level haikal done with a chance you can really rely on that I love Italy I think she's so incredibly good it takes a very strong player to actually find success with a champion because you have to be on the game plan of supporting your in facing and try to keep our farm not just your side of the mat power farming the enemy's invading the enemy's a harassing them with beers is stuck with Bigsby component to this camp at black man. You got to Love Field quadrupling down on a poke composition the name of the Game Force EOD is hate your skill shot or lose the game too slowevery single Champion is this and usually you need something to tie it together something to go to at least land some sort of initiation for them some sort of crowd control maybe some sort of disengage I like them and then they find a find like a stank gum out Tire some of the top Lane. But it mustn't happen well as engaged but had to say I'd like to meet Jesus coming out to try and pray it does go a long way yes it is a far better look for CLG what's the Players Club Champions with its PAW Patrols I feel like catfish look very good in the poppy who wants to buy Sunstar he wants my armor and bass can I think pretty cleanly going to releaseplastic fuel pump failure to the state that's not happening right cat has been cleansed expecting devices to fate Brewing on The Chase has the expected Low Top Lane but is that is that wrong to think that way I don't think it's wrong to think that way I would say there is an extra wrinkle that you do need to consider of their jungler is a P4 CLG so wherever the Cassiopeia goes I would not want my Lane opponent to go to rush the magic resist you mention poppy wanting to build Sunfire if they have a topside the map that is nidalee Cassiopeia then the puppy very clearly is going to be able to rush magic resistance Twisted Fate usually doesn't do that because he tries to get the extra manner or go to Rod of Ages build even to be a little bit more Tanki most Twisted Fates are AP nowadays suck some 8 so I do agree but I definitely see it this way as both got Sophia and Jace can run the face recipe extra mobility and get the kiting and then you kind of avoid the problem of RussiaBMR alrighty well we are onto the ramp for our first game of the day Evil Genius is a 1-0 start to the LCS 2020 Summer split CLG on the right hand side the tenth place finisher from last split but are looking to improve and everyone gets a lot of how to pull out there thinks he can do it and continue to lead this squad Susan success and Wiggly is going to have a lot of pressure on his shoulders this game on Middle East is definitely a champion vet really rewards you being skillful and smart with your engages and I would say last year so much lately was very good. When ruined join the roster in the night 2019 summer I thought it was a really big Improvement in Wiggly played with a while and see what you got all the third place in the 2019 summer playoffs that all went away on the TVyeah it's it's definitely did I'll go away and go see very clearly last split super rough time at the bottom of the standings for for Victoria told police actually Wiggly going to start on the top side though as expense Karen I really closely do you want you track please leave happier because Kendall is definitely an opponent jungle Champions that Italy has a lot of extra control over if there's trouble can not fuel Force things on the noodley speaking and he can get Vision you can try and throw a filler in right away and you can try and Dodge those beers but it's it's really in the control of the Adobe Player and the newly players Lane to play off of he's just doing a what looks like a full size red tide clear to stop down here and maybe that does signal some more pressure came at Bangin basil as big as they still areChristine Fulton falls asleep or she sticks out in the day off of the waves and they've been busy Half Men already by Lennon Tabasco sauce on a smoothie that can flight Lee hamper the UE laning phase where we got the look now we're Relic Shield is very very, and an enchantress down here now you don't often get to hit it pretty much on Facebook you're very much so you get some more guaranteed golden come by just left it with Relic Shield one Savory waiver so and I didn't receive your items on time if you want to go for the spell thief but in this case just make sure we get the golden company item flights looking at bottom crab for Weebly can finish his full clearif we can get an isolation of the Top Lane matchup though that will really favor Co G2 favor ruin as you know before poppy gets her first back to go back and get some more resistance is it pretty much Jace gets the free rein you can see the phase Rush Brock their ruin constantly leaving Indy's Auto attacks While, most trying to scrape up some CS it's also important Lane drop into the brush on the side so you drop any Dominion Agra values game so you can retain control of the wave but that's why I like we believe doubling back to top crab and try to gain some more Vision some more security here for ruin I've been sippin able to get this isolation and they do have double damage types of fear with ap jongleur and AD top lanerright now looking at the top of a match up though it's not too bad to fight the isolation yukumo only down for csgo has two biscuits in his health bar with ruins Mana bar in Rouen is almost out of Mana to poke with so it feels like Uma has weather most of the early storm will see they would level five two shot bus come down not yet there we go but that's going to cost me a hundred soul man every time and female the first biscuit is just going to be able to sustain it feels like just enough has the shield X out now and then holding on so far OK junglers thingy close Wells or as time goes on up nights when there are no problems and is the acceleration gatehe doesn't slow so that was a crucial flash new the Kumon could follow up humo I see flashes going to land the slam as well it's only been so much worse for you invest expected to come through with less it's the mid lane toppling going to be a sequel and farm the Roku to bring TV pretty soon as a ruined already has but can we need to shortly to highlight in that little Skirmish Affair is the speed like you're talking about really was cognizant of the combo he knows exactly what you're looking for it's it's one of those poppy + anyone who can create to rain probably the funniest one is Poppy and if you are then they have nothing in the back but trouble putting up the pillar as soon as it's their ruin knows that that's what they're looking for stuff they do get the the Flash's traded I think that is it's one of those things that you've yourself or specifically looking for with Kumo and you have 14 X Games writing flashes being cognizant of the offensive tools that your opponentall bode well for egn for their young stop winner already so you'll probably send a message to the logs stored as the first recalls up in that lane since Karen gets his upgraded Smite he got a while back when you recall that's doing the bottom scuttle-butt some ability power now in and more damage Sports dicks acld forcibly little farm down here you can see bang Russian Executioner's calling to try to make sure those trade looked very good against booty keep my smoothie has not only his normal you speak it but also Summerhill on that one so really cut down on that dealing with to be a few very effective and I'll see if I can actually going to do some kind of feel fresh down there finding the group Dixie. A200 help if we leave out of manifest but now it's light in the top side of the map is the damage far too much Wiggly cannot get away First Blood come soon Azucar Kumo able to get the road off to the enemy jungler see if ruin let them out those going to find him at the gate and
or if flyquest pulls up this upset it would be one of the biggest Shockers NLCS history becoming the fifth over organization to actually went to final so it's going to be really freaking I can't wait it's going to be absolutely exciting bestify We Are the Champions like tea or forced out that was a high speed going to choose blue side here and I am very curious looks like because as you mentioned cloud has been just the most dominant scheme and everything should tell you that cloud 9 are going to be heads and sold about the competition and yet seems Blacklist to get better with the roster swaps easy as well as Cloud 9 to the president can't let go of the fact that maybes wife West has closed the Gap Band on the right day figure take the series as we get in this hoe got five but I'm curious what kind of competition takes shape here yeah I think I've walked enough sports to know that even when there's an overwhelming favorite nothing is certain so always waiting to see what the actual results are just yesterday Quest on red side in 3 drafts in a row against niji currently hovering and also either LeBlanc and the power picture was getting taken orally on to distract Affiliates instead in order traded right away black with leaving at 3 pick available for something else that can be very aggressive ice in both expect that to win against of dahlias place with ever and so I'm here to fly first Rush pick a good defensive support that can keep a wild turtle safe for us to go somewhere else without the chance that a band as well but Bob and have walk-ins their first three as well which is our cue and in terms of what's been banned in the second phase right now off being taken out because it does look to me like flyquest is signaling Papillon jungle even though you know that that can be for the support I wonder, considering here whether or not they wanted to ban away the kind of Guardian style supports like the Brom or maybe even the thresh things that could have kept afelio safe I think having both bands on that attack you want to deny that access points for flights west end up instead decided to focus their band more towards our people died during the pre-show that the mid jungle for both of these themes is the strong point so even if there is potential draft vulnerability to attack on the mid lane Champions with long can cats go away write the first good thing to be very volatile you got Pantheon who is to say soup cream jungler right now it's like two more Jungle Band their second-half the edge in that match ups at how to pick in the mid lane I didn't go to the store at this point who has the better record good ol boys come into his computer or maybe we should a drain stinks up very well with his ears Soldier rain so it can make them hear a little bit more vulnerable I think overall do a year has been trending upwards in priority and it is a little surprising that we saw a captain in band before we saw in his ear band which makes me completely okay with black buttons not waiting for an azir counter picks we stop over in the LEC finals a Xerox turn it all the way into first pick by the end of that Series so really high priority lately on these here how do I get to Seymour Ferrari on marketing junglers here as well we saw TG play a bunch of votes during their unfortunate lost Aflac what's Bob and picking right up with been staring left off it's like yeah so far in the playoffs it has been very successful Zaxby's blitzcrank games including playoffs self more so like bookhunter for Kindred before for Veigar like in the mid game specifically is pulling people out of the Kindred ultimate there's a lot of displaced overall team competition show even though it has been a great Kindred this is a tricky game to navigate for Cottondale there's several good character for blood circulation the Kindred. See if you're a very good prank kills Shields and set it out argue primary tanks that is in Poppy's W and getting about half is Max Health yet to have excelled in a big Shield which you one shot deal damage after work instead of that set can be killed Nautilus X to my shielding as well so is actually quite a lot of value here that ignore can easily put forth in this game is going to be very exciting to Watch What Happens here I like the flag Quest draft Huey is on I think the epitome of teen site Mages and should be able to put up a bit upset that are 1000 damage permit at game like he's done several times before in the postseason and we're ready to go through this one has to be really exciting and passing Edition here for the finals as we got the player cams showing their remote setup so even more minute king of counsel I view environment but yeah freaky the early game here is go be really interesting because I want to know what's in Torrington activate here in the early game something that's been most impressive to me in the playoffs on blabber is actually some of his Nocturne early game pass because he's been able to pick jungler true or disadvantage in the early game but true where he passed get gold and experience advantages the other Junger take over self Papillon it's just such a monster from kind of level 3 on words in terms of early gang pressure let's pay attention to the early Wards and really where blabbering Central and go okay going to be watching the jungle pathing special the first 3 minutes or so in this game is so far it's the docile start you got for a little fence of words in each side ignore pick up where you left off really yesterday's games where he tried to pressure bit level ones you can get it okay to put the board down by the tracks in the bladder will see the pantheon going to start when is he Kindred get their flu to start a fairly similar opening that I really want to point out that a lot of time panteon can and take the other popular Pantheon path is actually the wolves and then into the Red Sox's jungle Central and has just done a red butt start so it will throw a few things off in terms of what slaver might be expecting also really pay attention to where Central and goes at 3 minutes I think he's probably the most frequent 3 minutes ganker of all LCS players soap generally that geckos Midwood house defensive miscues playing probably not till he's been involved need to be ready around 3 minutes to see if Santora's going that way because that's kind of where his path is taking him read if you look at how the mid lane is going right now keep why it was hard shove by PeeWee in the first two wave so now it's bouncing back and let's probably go hard shoves this will go to the red side of the map and Black overextend to fight for farm so he made the lame walk to go to spot word if you could be gay as they know they're safe from pancakes for a Honda shovel be no problem playing at Edwards on that side really good Roman To The River by Vulcan as well because that would be where Santorum would be waiting if you was planning against bottom and it just allows blabber to get a 5-pin clearly on have to watch out of this kind of crap do I think he may have been expecting santorin to be elsewhere because he's not going to get anything done by being the river here can I get something done right there it got on the road over actually. I would have done it and unlawful to help our love but lately I've been my fault so even if even if you ever did get the markings on the bottom one regardless loses both anyway. Thanks for 3 called when it has not done that yet so I sent her an up a camp up and vision felt flattered though at least we have fast for farming and goes back to his house as well to spot out the ward the tent when was just able to place but so overall bladder keeping off Central and hasn't necessarily taken something over yet and the game is yet to break open one thing that I want to touch on quickly here in terms of why this matchup can be exciting is how much better flyquest has looked since Adam solo and for those you have an Australian following solo he's a player who didn't have a team in the offseason and side with flyquest as it assistant coach halfway through the split to Denbigh thrust into the starter position kind of right before playoffs and has played the vast majority of playoff games for this team it's just been almost like this story book split for solo and now going up against licorice I was reading in some of the threats yesterday just wanted to call out how impressive that story has been in it would be just even more ridiculous if he was able to somehow pull off an upset today Yaki solo the only player on flycast has not been in some kind of important final Already Here Pay challenge final performance overall syllabus absolutely been a standout performer and instead of last half of the split and it is part of the reason why you know my brains as well as a chance here it is his paws Lane matching up baby to what liquids can offer as we look at the early Lenny faces of course licorice is us people with sports team fight Powers very strong in the Lord and the power of Santorum patch on right now and there was first Blood 6 minutes in bulk and gets away to safety but same tour and Stripes first in the final and here's the red flag that was thrown up and see how he's draft is the fact that if Pantheon get on Kindred ultimate that was obviously ignore take Scarlett to Charlie game doesn't get experience with what they got other teams in the playoffs yeah very impressive stuff right now to you fly Quest if you take a look at his fight yet again it's too bright Hook off of work I mean if they tried to scatter off that control because they knew blitzcrank was going to be coming didn't react to flash the hooks. Maybe you'll be able to sidestep afford especially when near terrain that's blitzcrank's favorite place for you to be because it doesn't give you any past the Juke the only way they could avoid that book based on the path you took would have been with flash now I'm take a look at the other parts the bathroom real quick as soon as he's being hands of lopsided for power of evil this is us doing a very good job with the early game good job of the Jungle great job in mid and if so low safe up here on the top side but she is still catch up with topland Farms well yeah and I think with blabber doing his best to stay competitive in the farm game that he's unable to help set up any types of Dives that would otherwise happen around powerful solving set so what's interesting about this game is I feel like C9 and drachenfels advantages in the top and the bottom Lane but because Kendra can't safely invade the jungle of flyquest do ^ Pantheon they can't convert on any of those who's which is why the game is so low and kills just blubber can't move or he normally would like to move sent to Central and right now going towards what he wants to eat to the topside for this Rift Herald Cloud 9 are running over both can see if I fly Quest that said this summer play Cloud 9 by the slimmest of margins keep her alive and steal the rift are getting narrowly avoiding disaster actually because they grown got five people if lava would have died there would have been really bad it's also dangerous to
that they had picked themselves into against Cloud9 the analyst just talked about this as well as ale mention yeah I'll take this key on Veigar and blabber on Tinder because that's not a dominant early-game mid jungle Duo so I wonder how much of this draft is going to mirror what we saw in game 1 of the first three bands it's identical yeah I do the things that I would definitely not Trey. I don't think cloud 9 has a strong reason to change things up I am curious if life was felt like any of Cloud 9 pics were incredibly terrifying and his ear is what cloud 9 wants to give little respect to this baby doesn't Force the mountain Veigar as their example counterpick let's say so that will be okay with Cloud 9 can I Rush pick a champion knowing that if you want me to counter or don't have to you know set up fans around that being a steel in popularity during this class because you had two games Word game one had identical pants to get into but I don't think they should ever happen because even the winning team could learn something from game one with which this week and I think Cloud 9 in this game are the ones who deviated from the plan first scary game so you are a very similar the question is what can fly fest going to come through and if they're going to empty on shows up as well but do they price of Pantheon now right now this Cloud 9 News black bus will take it early isn't that cloud 9 would take on Bluetooth reset that mean it's like as the graviton read to what's really interesting here is even though set is already locked in that doesn't necessarily mean Cloud Nine already has their top later so if like what does it take corn here I could totally see Vulcan playing on Keystone set support and actually take an order on this rotation as like West Valley defender of which was banned in game 1 okay and it means they move around into account or mashup McGregor that is the band that cloud 9 let's when they put as beer on the list thing okay are answers to this Champion is going to be out to a gragas and they instalok is it's likely going to be the mid jungle even though it's possible that that is a bot Lane combos where if you do get hit by even a grand ultimate level 6 you're probably going to die it'll be really interesting to see how how much the insurance has to babysit for power of evil to keep him in this game and he's going to be a couple of bands most likely is Cloud Nine oh no they have a decent jungle matchbook and toss those things out of darts and the additional thing here now is it Cloud 9 doesn't have the 80 karrie pick so we can go Fairly far down then champion pool obviously varis in Dawn Santa is banned affiliate is gone he played Miss Fortune last game which has pretty good rotations in good Teen Titans an incredible the second most prized. Later is empty in there as well so yeah but shows right to ban is where they put the pants on that's enough come through as well but it is also very compelling so but I do want to see if those come through because then he's not playing it a lot champ doesn't have it in the tank empty does will wait to see if horse the band is coming through okay yeah and actually I don't know if that if that is actually toppling set based on the fact I'm just thinking through if they do pick like an Israel Twitter bot like they would for on having too much physical damage because gragas would be the only a piece dress but if they do Calista set bought they're going to pick her right now and their compositions going to be a lot more balanced I think that's what we're going to start at Galaxy brain it's Calista stop timer boss test for I'm not serious but it still possible to the bottom line something up there okay so they're going pretty heavy in physical damage here gragas being there only magic for a set second Super open I'm kind of sad for not seeing all these Stones supports that cuz I need to be an armed guard out of the syndrome of the you mean it's not that easy to build armor on a Philly so she wants to go through item guardian angel with will be hard to kill and ignorantly hard to kill but if I just want to kill backline first they can still realistically take down Tower of evil and wildturtle in most team fight and it's going to be 5 at that point we'll see what happens if there is some more let's see them than just that and there is that little bit of vegetable platter has but we're solo ignorance and Torrence to get will still being a moderate damage breast with items like throwing Mills on fire cave yeah and I also think it's really interesting how a fellios has trended throughout the playoffs because there was definitely a time during these playoff swear you were just prevent no one was willing to let him through but that's also went on Kent wasn't getting banned because you could still stay the affair Leo's turtle is very much alone afelio Sandlot these fights what does make him vulnerable to getting jumped on a special order talking about stuff like set Caracas Yasuo that is just so much stuff to kill turtle with it's going to be a journey in this next game it is going to be a journey and of course welcome back to our ESPN audience the game is about to begin and we have a very exciting graphing this one is going to be closed for the Cloud 9 side and also that's bendre very highly prized Jackie the fellas well there are two huge power pics on the flak westside of there going to be very pleased to use here and we're going to go sell some of the game in just a second and honestly the first 50 minutes flyquest had a great start send torrent plus eggnog together combined her first blood pressure all around the map the Cloud 9 did get better mid-game that rhymes with new one I want the same thing can happen and I just want to make a quick note for the viewers about these player cancer we're seeing in for the purposes of competitive Integrity the whole stream is delayed till the coaches can't on live see what's happening on a stream or something so everything is pushed about a five-minute delay the player cams last game became undelayed due to a bug show that is hopefully fixing this game and it should be synced up what you're seeing on the player cams and what you're seeing in gameplay for this game pause the video feed and is it okay to respond to the game I pause the video of boomstick it up and it was an editorial choice to show that cloud that is so good that from that lead they can win 0 v v I think that was actually cannot see what happened in the game that the players are telekinetic and just use the keyboard to buy some across across the room for the game probably not. I can walk away taking less damage and that is honestly it is Flash burned but their exhaust and he'll using the Cloud 9 side mount boat and yet again feel comfortable and off that early play just might ignore his cheating it they don't get the better side of it and change it to Blue Steel honestly don't think that santorin cares that much about his blue being stolen or for thinking about Camp one timings there's actually going to be a slow start for blabber the more important thing is the Summoner spell usage in it is 242 however I think hexflash users like Alistair or much more free to burn their flash early because if they have brought control they still have a lot of phone to an Xbox of course it makes them more vulnerable and reactive situations in terms of Getting ganked By but for all the action the output is still I think a relatively close. brighten the lack of black doesn't matter for offense but it matters to the defense because that make you say okay what is blaberus Pathak because the obvious retarded is on ignorance head at the chances that you can kill if you find something to do on it so you look at that I was passing he's so blue took Raptors ran to his left side jungle I think he will probably recall and it's clear box pokespot Lane with Predator boots and and that might be where she puts impression will see that can happen to game 2 in game 1, 9 had stronger pushing Toth and bought leans but they were pushed in in Midland so they couldn't really take control the map they have an opportunity here we're all their Lanes can be pushing and blabber want to play very aggressive although at the current moment people pushed into overtime from Hunters towels went to Seven health in townsmen last hit it been torn away so quarter 2nd for one more Auto before Smita got me now he's actually going to a double scoped previously it didn't matter what he actually based on his past would have been able to get level 4 off of that Scuttle crab now he's still sitting at level 3 laverkin take both shuttles and Central and has to farm his little meal from that is a bit of a tragedy that is a very tiny Miss play that you very rarely see but it came up do 3 Camp recall to pick up boots to have the gang threat laboratory much more of an aggressive full clear actually going to go for a bit of an aggressive trade that bottom Lane is going soundly in the favor of course the trash the closest rest is extremely potent as a Duo more so then the afelio Salas respectfully Master doesn't have the defensive tools to be able flash away so it did that kind of white even more crucial that santorin didn't get control if I had those cattle crabs it means he can't provide any assistance to that bottom leaning has been involved in or going to start may be running away with it but I want one of a couple of small details of how licorice plays this match be seen a lot of Tetris Orem games and there's a couple of similarities that it seems like licorice us every single time so what is he always takes a very early Rico for Kohls actually sustain life on it is better to take the W for Wednesday look like new auto tag off of the W charge cuz that is like at the end of the Orion combos Wii steak on the damage he sets up the shields that he blocks most of that when the percent Health damage auto tag comes in and uses that animation to guarantee that his own W is in a land for damaged it's a nice display watching licorice play through this matchup you can see one of the reasons why he's so confident playing this in two games in a row and especially if we're tracking the the mid and late game the biggest thing about Statin those devices where he can land his ultimate there was a moment at the end of game 1 worth liquor straight who took 60% of Pee-wee's house because you all possess solos orange back in to peel easier so that's the Top Lane and then down bottom Wayne the things are in complete control for Cena and you can that bought land pressure to pick up the first rake good game well played from Vulcan throws up the candy heart and that is first break yet very early on as well I am always impressed of a team can I think that's the mark of a lot of bottling controlled speaking of which one TCS lead for his vent and Vulcan as a player but first time of the year and is absolutely sure could be a going to have a blast it look like I talk it over the wall by the devil wears a black couch and watching back as well as some of his back can bring them if needed end of the day it's still a flash down to wild turtle Patrol of Dogtown for Vulcan it doesn't mean they won't be targets down the stretch I think as we mentioned wild turtles going to have a charger on his back pretty much this entire game flyquest even though the goal was even is way more on the back foot right now than they were during the early game of game 1 Yep this is a good as a pretty good start all things considered at least relatively for cloud nine going to feel pretty solid the farm still going through will get pet the solo who has left the match there but he's actually help substantially lots of the map on the orange Midland Lot close the last time around and has before has been feeling really don't want the bottom line for the player who didn't have an LCS team during the offseason subbed in towards the latter half of the split split time with the other top laner before becoming basically the full-time starter after flyquest was knocked down two losers bracket so it's been quite a ride for Solo in he is still performing a very high-level against licorice definitely has goes up and take some honey fruit catches back up in health and Mana
they haven't won since the 2014 spring split that was the end of one of the most in the 33 in the summer of 2013 + 29 + 4 in the spring of 2014. This best win percentage of any team ever surpassing their own Ford record but that route has been on 459 fans and after game 2 it looks like they're porchthat really is incredible I think that's that's the way you summon upright is Cloud9 to have the two most historically dominant split and look at it like a retake that and take the number one but because it's been six years group 259 things that have not gotten to experience Cloud 9 domination live they've been good International they headed to the world semi-final couple years back there was some really good moment they are from them but domestic success has eluded them for so long I mean a few years ago back when they still made out of a while ago but they are factored form now it's an old new roster if it's the last thing that was gone as of this year has come together incredibly well and as we found in which side is the draft of black with pink and blue they still want that. The choice that most teams make when they have toyit's something flyquest object against last game and in part pay the price for but animals tested a great job breaking it down how Cloud9 everyone first pic worn with set not available does mean that liquid is going to have to take something new. All right and you got to go play something self could not bring them quite into win then he was definitely been the best performing bot laners this year is going to be on the most highly prized champion in dispatch licorice were expected to have an outside chance that they could Flex that one pic into the mid lane and then takes a gangplank in the egg drop soup is something still loaded very well but I think the biggest thing here though is desire, the fact that because their bands got more limited and now it ignores most potent Champion is available and it's locked down into a pretty strong. It shows very clearly Cloud 9 says Hey set is the most important contestant Tostitos championship in the work on this is definitely a source of power and Southern right away no face ghost vitamins draft and now we're going through the band's end up being at the got jungle in mid to kontest now for our ESPN the game and I think this is so interesting now knowing that the first part of the draft has been relatively the same in most of the game has the most variation and one of the reasons the rakan is big on agnarr ensure the lady face and be good but it's more just what he does in the game how much he sits behind the enemy team and makes it difficult to go into a safe place and to meet thank goodness C9 pick someone who can help Affiliates his Mobility with the fellas I think that was the one big step in both like Westerly grass is drafting and Affiliates with nothing to protect him at least for construction off of the lantern in the play in the box and all these other tools to try and keep him alive so we'll see how that plays out truck game yeah it's kind of bring to the argument is that flight Quest was there were playing about giving him the most expensive champion in one that you can build around it was always about power of evil instead this time around this morning Natural Energy Efficiency on wild ultimate has the on-demand route in most cases the bands have come through three jungle bands come out with Olaf rek'sai and drag us all off the table and eat the cloud 9 we're going to grab they don't have that from the second one yeah it's standard composition for is something that is had a really high priority in a lot of serious but just because of the way the grass is played out haven't seen it yet as you mention drugs band means Garvin and the last thing that unites going to be holding his missing counter pick and they ban away the LeBlanc it was blacklisted me to fix that as the answer to us pants for early game jungle pressure sensor comes in as a blind bit later they know they're not going to be up against the oppression that was Yasuo bracket the previous game but now look around for the last game of the spring played so far in the split even though he's had such a fool by p o e i mean the fact that Andrea has been so dominant the rumble is the thing that you match it with I'll get into specifically how I feel like that match of plays out because it can go either way I seen it go either way in a lot of these games and it's going to be on C9 to perform okay. I think for the better that's going to change how big is our rooms in as the second best support this year the only man right behind is going to change the texture a lot I like the strap for flyquest as you mention Jack Cloud 9 get a lot of chances that work really really well for them you like the threat to help the afilia stay safe you like The Rumble in the passenger is well and I ate rocks we know liquor store at first glance I'm completely okay with what both teams did hear you can look at flyquest draft and see all the power picks in the fact that they got work on and you could definitely hindsight just want to say hi how did Cloud9 let's get these things but we've seen Cloud 9 make good rats look bad and make you know great rash look average and so much of it has been with how quickly they move around the map how well they play together the play the control vision and if they can close this one out with the current draft they have as we mentioned it would be the most dominant individual split in LCS history and Cloud 9 building off their own records it'll be fun to see them do it with this squad that has never won domestically in North America before you're ready to go into this game to see who can take it Over The Line Game 3 I do want to mention a small plate of history about 920 van slyke West in the series The Last us with v that cloud 9 or flyquest played one where they had a dominant game 3 windy Jihad 1 / flyquest EG have I ever Cloud 9 on those ways to the 303 so maybe have for the same happened with like what does turned around yep and just a note this is currently 204 Cloud 9 unlike the ones are you see at the top of the screen over here and early game I think it is really important to focus on the jungle pathing and what happens to the Midland porch because this syndra Rumble match up is key if in my feelings if the syndra pantheon plays perfect and pass around Midland it beats the rumble driving but if you let the rumble push with impunity and not get punished when he's burned his cool down while shoving the wave then the rumble can start moving into River and that's what's tearing his kind of hoping happens so let's watch where the early Wars are let's watch Rick Santorum past because he is kind of been the master of the pre 3-minute Gak my ready once again not a lot of really aggression in the very early game we've seen a couple teams go for invades late sweeper plays but ultimately we in this game we're going to see not quite as much happened we did have a fryer Blue Bell steal from the greatest of Cloud 9 in game two this time around or going to let the teams play their respective sides the map Red Bluff Police were both struggling since you're going to go read towards baseness starting Easley going to the Raptors and probably topside and the Jarvan going to clear it with his blue belt as well expect people to cheat a little bit towards that side what we seen some of the clever driving games exactly when they start read but then loop around to the blue side to get the gang can before they do that on what some jumpers there would consider a cheese game where they're actually for going efficient Farm in order to get a surprise and gank yeah I really am a fan of why was Bentley what they have seen of him more than other junglers is hyper efficient in what things might for example on Jarvan who's been purely physical damage bluebuff the highest armor Target in his conventional jungle clear to finish kids V can't wear as Pantheon is only on his fourth do in terms of overall paste that's an advantage since Central and hasn't gone for his normal game timing I mean looking at the way right now this is what happens if the sender's playing breath waiting is not punished by games you can actually get that level 3 shove on the driving but sent toward actually needs to be here to protect actually ganking at the right at the perfect timing plaid would have been there about 10 seconds earlier and Skip wolves maybe he would have been able to get a gank off on a POV but so far so good for flyquest Deborah Leigh syndrome happy we playing at Freddy's part he did board topside River and then she did to that side of the wave pushed in realistically easily guess we never stopped when the flats Sun Liquor's burns his own flat but he will go down three games in a row that play. How are people shoving that first wave a lot of times a cinder will go back for an early recall their get like a second or Inns and that's probably what she thought was happening but she's cheating the CC not even perfectly just getting the pantheons done into the burst of everyone else is enough to bring Liquors down and also very important getting that first Blood on the symbol mechanical pick up here for licorice love giving that went early on in the Orange versus Spain to stay healthy in the one as well as golden come down the line that is an underrated was the movie purchase plus if you are forced to an awkward recall this year that pays off down the line is a much worse recall comes through for this key he dropped the Ruby Crystal and that's it. Are people going to feel that we're going to go with the main reason and the extra ability power Target on POF but the fact that he's been able to get that really recall blasting on does increase his threat in Weymouth if he has santorin what we call shadowing him where any time you'll go on p o e stand for after this. As well as the land that you'll be able to shut himself as we as we shouldn't mention to Mid jungle has been so critical and C9 success it is. Who is take control of it at least for the first five minutes in this game 3 also thinking of control bot Lane so far going well for the Cloud 9 side we know xayah rakan is one of the scariest feeling pretty good about that matchup 5 and 1/2 minutes in the bottling and gun for great control this is going the way it has kind of all students lockers best by far the best bot Lane and leave completely lay down I think that's a really good call out in terms of matchups in a regular split C9 their entire starting roster was first-team All-Pro there's no argument that they were all the best performing in the world but in this series in particular the biggest Gap so to speak has been playing pretty even dogs even had CS advantages as an orange into licorice has been playing quite well in Saint torrent has been getting a lot of really getting for his blood a lot of it is actually been has been involved in pushing the tempo down bottom Lane getting kills get it yeah I mean Cloud9 are getting a lot done here through bottling we knew ignore was going to be one of the vacation to your flash West number to All Pro support right and it's not for his lady gets from his Romeo from his right now he's being pushed out of the unable to win the land itself of course start showing trukhina flexes off on him through fine for roof of bladder drops actual person see that our guy goes so incredibly well plan on going to kill in the Ford Model 620 CS behind. But he's the one able to threaten that also really crucially wildturtle unable to flash the jar viniq you cannot buy enough time for everyone else to follow through and that's the part that we talked about getting wild turtle down getting those plates keeps denying in it it's looking pretty good but if you want to put up flyquest r600 gold ahead if there is to be a game 3 win Flacco's have the makings of it right now where they're looking really good middling plainly definitely possible to do not want to count flyquest out right now about 9 though still going to do their best to run around the map
I hear the combination of the split with the championship qualifier today right into Champion Select excited to see where the priorities are really going to lies and pick them up and see if people are talking a lot about the Midland matchup but you know sometimes if you're focusing too much on one match up that can be at the expense of others and you talked about how solo was dominant over Kumo in their previous series when I get them. Then a lot of people to talk in a bag at the potential wind conditions in the late game do because he has his do solid throughout the entire year but that's far you know there are some of those keep being removed we can save her calling taken away for ignorant people really highlighting his playmaking ability he had gone back to come the more grip fix things like Blitz and pipes still available if you were to go to war with them or, I think is the most obvious to others by making sports that you can go to without having to think about while your parents are playingfor the AC in the cloud has ever taken off the table thing to do move around I think that was a good match of the day we still have the AC if they actually want to place where the bottom side of the map I do think VPN to foreign can be quite solid I think solo DP is France's best previous track did you say some more standard pick that is going to be what they will go to war with Kendall has been a strong performer on this year to scrapping you fellows for a wild turtle that has been Marksman but it is going to be an aggressive response here from EG Civic review on with Calista Tarik really strong pairing you can't utilize Kik Alyssa alternate Dubai time for a chair to getdon't alter it off beatin off the use it more aggressively obviously throwing in the tereck instead of the batch is done and that can be a very good pairing and is that immunity allows Calissa I would say the wherewithal to stack up with Spears and try to look to get aggressive in its worth play here for Flight Support either way for those you on ESPN heading to hook commercial brick online station stop tryna locked in here against the orange that is going to be really strong and when it comes to the team fighting stage we don't know obviously what the jungle choice is going to be here for EG I'm expecting that can already been. So within could be another one to get banned out here I do think it's it's been scaring probably has been Champion historically over the last couple years and can be pretty strong level priority in those early games but pretty well for that v e v off in Orange is bitter that kind of tea by feet think of becoming extremely difficult to actually hope down but what difference does it make, more of a tank and self and also does how to shred through that oorn zodiac to going to be the van here though so worried about some of these kind of the LeBlanc the Zoe both taken away those are some of the more economically dominant pick he does have a lot of those pics that are more Side Lane when you think about the rise when you think about the echo champions like this so we could still see EG go towards arrived but has less worried about the scaling pick and they're the kind of side lamp place and they are about to go meet me pressure in that early game and it is going to be blitzed so this is really exciting ignore again could be willing to go towards those Playmakers okay so aggressive support option is there resolve Mark Z with the beautiful Ms paint drawings I just got the blinds are Midland they're going to answer with Kindred off the table and I actually like that as a combo because the speed up and the rez you can throw a bomb on or off had you can see them up sending it to the back line to read gives you I think more viability to go later into the game billion as a picture I think this was just a nod's as back of our people does have counter a great to be another aggressive option here this does give you more damage or the Laker game because when you are playing it was Gillian and warn your consistent damage to be fairly low in the later stages the games that's been scared he is going to go with another Marksman option this is a good matchup against the trundle you can use your data go over top of that how to build a kite out the trundle and sometimes even use the filler again this is a power farmer very much does deal like a 525 South of the terror for the ultimate you have the support of time and I'll be to your front-line there of corn do a lot of Frontline a building of fighting ability with the humerus and actually taken down as Victor for power of evil so I have priority against the Sicilian but he gets enough levels do you get to a point where if you have enough that I think relatively new to borrow against harm you all right well wave clear Midland power going to be in there for power of evil is going to be fun to watch for with rates of course it has been a lower when Drake overall for him tobacco store ESPN. We are heading into the game start very very soon Champs have been locked in Peewee is on his signature pick in the Victor was actually pretty winning one for him if you if you look back in history is actually one of his lowest when are Champion that he plays a lot of I noticed I was up for example not opting into that one is a bit more comfortable and not only winning but more commonly pick for him but says okay Victor is a kind of style we want here I definitely see how the Marksman jungle pick comes through here because fence currently not been playing Champions like that he had one Kindred game is dorkly on the season so far no Bridge games of course Chris has to pick up couple of Puffs over time and go to see a kind of pressure face in the lineup why doesn't answer to the opposing jungler it was picked in the answer to the opposing top laner right was picked in the answer to the orange and scaring the ability to actually go for a matchup that he can abused in that jungle won't be one and the marks are really good at doing that cater is really good at doing it at Grace is really good at doing that you can out for him that trundle on the greys you can get in his face and I'll do a limb if you have the Red Bluff and and kite him out to use the quick try to get behind the pillar and actually use that against that trundle so I think it's a very exciting pick pairs well with the lower damage profile of the zillion in the Orion to should be really exciting game 1 yeah you don't have the easiest Armour stocking on the flak westside of course right because you're looking at the fact that okay A Truck Stop is it really want to buy a ton of armor when he's currently having to face against oranges or magic damage 5e you know you're not going to rush an armed guard on Victor really in general very much over all others you may have a decent chance to do it but even if your damage is primarily Marksman heaviness very physical heavy metal may still be enough to kind of keep up is because the reason that super durable Frontline that's still a lot of tools here on the flag beside of course right it can look really really good with blitzcrank roll around in the Middle Lane zillion don't have the best escape tools overall and and you never really really might see a lot of pressure down there right now and don't flash seats we can't get away from Bozeman to easily calculate from The Flash punch up either and the tropical I set that up as well so I can kind of see Midland pressure working really really well for flyquest even even the to be too it's actually really scary for terok because people think of tarek as a group of men with a Braum's in the Nautilus and whatever but are generally is building pretty squishy you're going for things like Redemption early on you know you often do not play Aftershock because it's harder to hit that Dazzle so you are actually fairly acceptable to just hooking in that tarek and actually just the focusing him down in that to be too so I do think that there is the ability not only for them to bring the same pouring down with a pillar setup a hook but you converge on at midlane is as marks he was kind of wanting out of flyquest if you show up with the trundle you pillar in the zillion slowing down that that's a pretty easy hook to at least work out of flash there from zucchetto do you think that largely this game will depend on the Play Making of ignoring I think that's kind of just how blitzcrank works if you are ahead if you were dominating Vision you can make as Champion look incredible and if you are behind and they see you coming every time this Champion looks like garbage compared to something like tarek yep going to be a while before I'll be having my eyes on the core stop playing as well we saw solo absolutely dominate Kumo in his to earlier or and games when they when they last played a couple weeks ago I was thinking more of the same so I am very curious exactly where the pressure does come down because like most has the Jets are really aggressive got any of those three lines that will be fun to watch for do you want to point out the 4th of you wondering why you're still see their faces and not gameplay just yet would you have to build up a gameplay paw perfect pet of Integrity that is almost done soon we had a bit of a slow start to the game for some Chuck listening issues but I will be ready to get into that game yet again and I want to sort of talked about some more of the EEG side of things then as we are going to first welcome to summoner's Rift everybody has a loser takes third-place winner faces Cloud 9 in the LCS 2020 ring fine and we're going to see in this game starts out better in this series of the five games for going to figure out who takes at least talk to a lot of starting out better in this playoff series is going to be about them boats election because I saw them popping some of votes so if you're going to be good with you most you have to have the right choices you have to have you know maybe the the surprise crab in there you know maybe the little popcorn eating amoeba know some of those ones are pretty good the monkeys are always a favorite band early in base here with a superintendent of a I really like because it does threaten a potential invade and asked if you wanted to give that experience to okay that's why they were delaying so much is going to expire because giving that to the zoo K would mean he would get to level 2 on that first wave that one minute earlier can make a pretty big difference sometimes in those mid lane matchups but a couple of really interesting things to point out already so I talked about kind of the preferential matchup of Grey's this Markman into trundle he's going to phase rush to to even further extend that because this makes it so that trundle really doesn't even have that pillar slow you know the pillar is not going to hold Grace and because he can't go over it but now you have phase rush to actually remove that slow and build the kite back and forth very effectively against that trundle which makes it even more difficult than just okay is also playing close by so this is going to be Super Soaker spooky ghosts going to be about the slowdowns not only does this setup for things like The Dazzle Sun from the tereck obviously makes it very easy to land a double bombs effective against heavy beams and we see that there are three millichamp compact is later on in the game and you'll play it more for the control which is really really powerful yeah and he telegraphs you put in general not only with just be glp out of the zoo kazillion but also even knowing for Azazel that he needs to pop his old lady in Mister into kind of re-engage anything really really impact really helpful because a lot of these things do want some set up where to build sometime and vacuuming for the nice early pushes going Kumo way she wasn't the truth that I should not it's a little Lots Farm giving someone a tap solo. A little bit greedy trying to see us everyone instead of 6 setting that he was going to miss some of those and prepping the next like sometimes you just have to make a choice that no I can't get this and you just give that minion allowed to Die 2 The Traveler prepping the other minions to get them in a position where the snakes but not too big of a deal with early on not going to be that big of a difference but Telegraph place the glacial augment can be very powerful and something that people don't always talk about that much now with the spooky ghost is actually how effective it is to help you work Friday allows you to actually scout out areas your tutu find out if they are camping in a brush but you can pop that active then your Tuesday so that is clear you can move in and it really does help to allow you to secure some more state vision all right we'll take a quick look around the map at how the Earth Elaine's have gone since we're going to get scuffs cuddle he went to the Evil Geniuses side with Graves and Co down their bottle and pretty clothes and farm Phillips. Back down again with Synthroid and Tow in case there is a gank but it looks like it's still going to be Kubo early on Mid fairly close to jump out to Camp so a fairly mundane early game with Jeff and be a fun surprise with Kumail doing well does match up very early on both teams have going on in the early levels that was because he was going to be clearing forests bought situations where you know your jugular is not going to be topside you actually want to bounce the Waverly so that it pushes back towards you while the enemy jungler is up there that is because the way people did not be put towards you can basically just get your turret be safe from any potential ganks and still know that you will have that farm coming in that you can collect that gold next. Safely on your side of the map get an all was well for him honestly, having a decent starter Leon will see if that changes around one of the things that solo. Phrase for when they flip a septum in the topside over Viper was the original flavors
for this year in playoff format the loser will always get side left and is no longer higher seed reflecting and 135 so little bit of a mix-up but we will see if you do want to change anything up the kind of joking about the salty runback funny things how many times we have seen these healthy run back to the every time so far in in playoffs thoughdictates that we open the lights order and then and it was going to get rid of a killer game the series and trundle is going to be a good second to that and I always feel like things get the better out of that if they have the diarrhea and you have to work on and it's kind of that step repairing so I am expecting you to be the horn for sick right away from EEG and then blackhave the ability to go to work on it they want here as their first to Habibi this will create potentially some mismatches as far as what teams are selecting in the first round but I felt like I was going to be banned out my flyquest. Even further surprise to me that they want saira Khan they're pinning out what they believe will be the response to that to get Squirtle with one playing this last time around So Cal first pic so they probably took or give them because they wanted to play this time around right flyquest are going to get to work on we know what's going to happen there a contested pick he's got games on it like it's actually his sixth most played all time to Fort across of career but it is only toxic Tampa to lose and win rate is just not a very big truck big for himAdele today at me for the sword gets to go to solo I am expecting a poppy to come through here it is if she thinks that I don't think that Poppy is is the best method of in Dorne and I also think that Warren has a v e v so I don't think they would go to Papi I mean if you want to go to tank you can go to like Malachi or something but it seems like if you'd given up the orange lines that you're probably just going to go towards a crock biggest problem with that right is it's a 10 years of taking the inferior version but not when laying but do the likely will not slam atrox if he's up in Pharma whatever over, maybe they think a year foris that you have now xayah rakan you have a really strong to be to the death Box about the back that they they had felt like what's to do with losing early this could potentially remedy that and there is film at the playmaking potential for ignore when he gets out of plane and going forward in the v v v v West Indies map of the orange so very very powerful setups already coming through for Blacklist all right well the pics have been locked in so it's time to send our ESPN commercial break alright so it seems like a lot of jungle bands coming through I ended the second phase of bands bracket City band out panteon type more likely be targeted towards in Torrance at least in is available Olaf is available set one is available to there are a number of options there and sit when he is fairly strong I do think with trundle already taken off the table has Zoe notably is left up your bored zouke that was something that was banned out last time around pieces Blanc was actually phase one bad and then the Zoe was banned in that second phase advance so there have been some slight differences year does Eevee feel confident going towards something like that again here if they wanted to run it back on the ceiling and you can still have that option to do things billion can function well with you cuz like aatrox but then you are depending upon who will having a strong laning phase 2B the one who is already you know how to pretty strong boy because billion really is kind of that Force multiplier when you are resonance beating up the one you want them to or EB ShareBuilder recti comes there is a partial block on the leaves throughout the year the greatest played all throughout the playoffs of course than band out so I am curious what he goes to next up is only comes through what you can expect that there at that was a band dropped off the table to take a note to have a good game out of this one once again jungle and pick the question is. What does Evil Geniuses play in the jungle position to that kid was left up from last time it's being covered and it is locked in very interesting so Kendra does get locked in a ton of Kindred lately it can have some really potent combination with tarek in particular not because of the interactions with your Altima engine Tarik ultimate so what you can actually do Kindred alternate first in the team fight and then assuming there's less timing down you can have it to the charcoal to Mays Landing immediately as a kindred ultimate is finishing instead of bites their you know my concerns with this with this combo that each year running is that your strongest engage really throwing in your Terror which doesn't feel all that reliable you are either having to them fit for bubbles in and fixes things like that with his or her into you and who is dominating in neutral Jeff is enforcing our bonus then come by you ask them where is Blacklist they have a lot of ways to start fights they can choose all these battles on their own terms and I think that puts them in a more comfortable position to pick and choose when they will fight we reach you really have to force their bone and only by going to neutral because they have no good at gauge a trip will hopefully the Poke is going to be enough for that walking back toward ESPN he was getting into the game in just a few moments hear the dress different look interesting though right it's very interesting to me especially looking at the incredibly high draft priority EG has on Callisto Terrace they have tried very hard every single time so far in these drivers they know we really really want to do this is what our competitions are going to tee off of this time around EG do have a lot more damage Force last time around it was a grave stopped at two items and and nothing could really die this time around is UK's do we should look good but there is good you got a good laying that's why I'm very curious if they can knock some people down with it by Grace Kendra are somewhat comparable I do think you're going to have to do more consistent damage because of Kindred strange noise as they stack up the marks but it's Jillian in Oregon compared to B&H rocks right that's the swap out from last game so they have a lot of damage vinsel here but they have kind of sacrifice a lot of their engaged to be able to get that and this is also I don't think he do such an easy match up in the jungle for for the marks and the last time I was about going to the trundle at dinner with the level Rome little one-room crazy off though we break out of the brawl yeah that would ultimately doesn't doesn't do too much the defensive word of flyquest you can see that the jury as you get screen right there that's going to stay up this time around for not seeing the Invaders fence during a code do for a delayed the ward weight of the sweeper and is it okay to have fun center until they're going to go ahead and just knock this down with that mic issue with the Q that doesn't obviously a tomb of going to this way Spencer is going to get a solo effort on this red bank and they were the Nazis that they really wanted Lane control because when you go for these Marksman junglers if you are in a marksman vs. melee matchup in the jungle if you can actually take away your opponent's red you can really run that one d one because wreck site without right against Kindred with red that is very one-sided for the Kindred in the early matchups because of the additional kiting ability that you have so that's why I think both of the grades and the Kindred game they went to a poor start they wanted your head up for that date of potentially even take that away from their parents but obviously very willing to defend or read me Romeo there bot Lane trying to prevent any potential take away their to make sure thing for I can still have them run of the Jungle so a lot of this is going to be kind of down two outfits Karen is able to play out to leave early levels because this is my most played Champions is this can't be in that I really love but you are extremely dependent on your ability to do with the opposing jungler often times to actually pick up these marks because very Telegraph where you want to go and you need to kind of try to get that for more point. That is a sleep somebody I love that place up for the spell Thief movie pick up as well for some extra moves me to bring his own the deal and I just get to write pack out of there so it's rate of Summoners as now EG look for someplace getting a Blu Cantrell and it can happen though blackbear just ran off towards 2 words where his Kendrick would be getting the very lucky Mark spawn here he went outside for that Scuttle it's just 50/50 on which schedule is going to have that first marketing that always feels so so good and it's also going to mean at 3 buff start because his bottling had the full push and was actually starting of Temple invade so sinh torrent giving up his blue running straight toward stop he's going to try to kill Kumo easy follow through with its first Blood Top Lane in Tank vs. Fighter for flyquest is invading his blue where do you think that the right side is if he's not going to bust out of the map he's got to be tough but Google had the wave in an awkward spot maybe you felt like you needed to try to shove it in his yeah it looks like he was just trying to reset that way but a portion for him he flashes from one side of the dock of to the other still gets hit by that and is going to go down for Nez Perce weapons during spawning on those wrappers and this is why you have to be strong enough to be able to do a strong enough to have pushing lanes because you want to be able to fight for these marks in and getting them really does amp up your power massively and getting to for is it sometimes the difference between successful team fights or not because of all the additional range that you get when you complete those first four marks anybody. If midlane wasn't a good enough spot but power of evil with ignore roaming had pushed control so they couldn't really walk down and play for the Raptor camp in the end of the day to do K had to let the way to push a nice talking to you at the ESPYs Rockin the boat lanes and that is the first offense with Mark denied right there no chance to pick up easily clean claims and cleaned out by santorin is it going to be specific threat the midline wave as Peewee walks back to help make sure that link they safe ignore going to stay as well as Shepherds Lane in and actually can force the studio yeah which can really punished as you can as you can have to take a slow walk back to Lane and he's going to lose by this way for the happens that is so frustrating because you're not playing with EPS is UK you have to have your FaceTiming they're having to support actually just gives up some for his time to breed that out you know you're going to be falling behind on experience falling behind on gold as a result of it so it's always a very frustrating experience against you but I do get you know it's playing a champion that he always has very safe range way up there so he will be able to get back to there and push it in without too too much worry it's not going to be like a permanent fries because surely if you done fries that but solo is 6in tour in his top and there is the potential of looking for Kumo here as they now know that River brushes clear and solo could look to start up with his ultimate if he feels confident Oquendo Center want to walk around he knows Kumo right over there because he would turn percents as well as the actual minions in the meantime spend time down the bottom side Motley control it was pushed in or near and how to plaster over the wall knows it to be respectful of what Saint George done to him this is really well done though from EG again this is one of those situations where when your your jugular has bought that control you have to give up on the top side so cool this latest date Turtle will give way out there I was very well. Chocolate glaze without rooting Summoners a no-kill very back-and-forth fight there no kills on either side but they do get a couple flashes off and Spence Karen and Days Lil for the flash of ignorant in Torrance flashes earlier in that played in a flashy still slightly in the Des rosiers Aflac last but really anytime soon
